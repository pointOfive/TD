Class assigned (average) rubric scores: Engaging Presentation (4.4), Visually Attractive (4.4), Explains article well (4.8), Fairly characterizes evidence strength (4.9), Avoids Personal Bias (4.7), Data Presentation Quality (4.6). These are somewhat low scores relative to the class, which I found quite surprising.
