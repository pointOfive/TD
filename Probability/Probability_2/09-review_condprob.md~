## 1. Conditional probability

Okay, with those general theoretical notions and principles reviewed, let's now turn our attention
to actually using these concepts in real, applied, practical ways. I.e., let's work through some 
conditional probability problems, with particular attention to some applications of Bayes' formula.


1) A simplified model for the movement of the price of a stock supposes that on each day the €™stock's price either moves up 1 unit with probability \\(p\\) or moves down 1 unit with probability \\(1 - p\\). The changes on different days are assumed to be independent.

2) A worker has asked her supervisor for a letter of recommendation for a new job. She estimates that there is an 80 percent chance that she will get the job if she receives a strong recommendation, a 40 percent chance if she receives a moderately good recommendation, and a 10 percent chance if she receives a weak recommendation. She further estimates that the probabilities that the recommendation will be strong, moderate, and weak are .7, .2, and .1, respectively.

A medical study is looking at a test to detect a certain disease. The data collected has shown that
- when a patient has the disease, the test is positive in 90% of the cases
- when a patient does not have the disease, the test is positive in 1% of the cases.
