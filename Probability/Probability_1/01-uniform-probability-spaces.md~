# Utilize venn diagrms to represent sets and describe probabilities 

## Set Up

### Terminology 

Suppose we are observing a particular phenomenon at a given point in time. For example, 

- which card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards,
- whether or not you get a text within the next 15 minutes, or 
- the next point in some predetermined grid for which lightening will strike.

Observing and recording result of a random phenomenon such as these above is known in statistical terminology as performing an _experiment_.
It is common to refer to the experiment using (an uppercase) \\(X\\). 
Building on this convention, an actualized result, or _outcome_, of experiment \\(X\\) is referred to using (a lowercase) \\(x\\).
And the set of all possible outcomes that might be observed in experiment \\(X\\) is called the _sample space_ \\(S_X\\) of the experiment.
Thus, \\(S_X\\) includes any outcome \\(x\\) that might be produced by experiment \\(X\\). 
To make this concept conrete,
let's suppose we can represent the collection of all the possible outcomes \\(S_X\\) of experiment \\(X\\) as a 2D "box":

>![uniform continuous](./images/uniform_cont.png)

### Uniform randomness

Now suppose for the moment that any outcome \\(x\\) that could actualize from experiment \\(X\\) is just as likely as any other,
so that every outcome \\(x\\) is equally likely.  In our above 2D "box" representation, this means that each "point" in the box 
(i.e., each outcome \\(x\\) in \\(S_X\\)) has the same chance of happening.  You could imagine this as throwing darts at the 2D "box" 
in a completely random manner such that hitting any given point \\(x\\) is as likely as hitting any other. 
This type of random behavior is known a _uniform_ randomness,
and given this uniform randomness we can start to make probability statements about certain sets of outcomes.  For example, 
in the figure below the set of oucomes \\(E\\) collected together within the boundaries of a circle
make up \\(20\%\\) of the overall are of the 2D "box" \\(S_X\\). Thus, the chance that an outcome \\(x\\) that we observe from the experiment being 
among the outcomes included within circle \\(E\\) is \\(20\%\\).
A set of outcomes such as \\(E\\) is known as an _event_, and
we specifiy the probability of event \\(E\\) occuring (i.e., an observed outcome \\(x\\) of an experiment \\(X\\) being a member of event \\(E\\))
as \\(Pr(E)\\).  For example, in the figure below we would say \\(Pr(E) = 20\%\\), or equivalently,  \\(Pr(E) = 0.2\\)

<strong>Aside:</strong><br>
Unifrom randomness isn't the only kind of randomness we might have in our current 2D "box" example, of course.
For example, you might imagine a sort of topographical map over the 2D "box" that specifies the outcomes in certain areas of the box
as being more likley than outcomes in other areas of the box.  
Indeed, the study of probability is in large part devoted to exploring and understanding these types of "more interesting" 
probability distributions, and we will certainly come back to explore such considerations further. 
Nonetheless, for the purposes of focusing ourselves on specific ideas germane to building up the necesarry foundations 
to address those topics without getting ourselves immediately bogged down in tangential complications, 
we'll assume for now that we have uniform randomness over all the outcomes in the sample space of the experiement.

### !question
Question 1

Assuming uniform randomness over the outcomes \\(x\\) in the sample space \\(S_X\\) of an experiment \\(X\\) represented by the following figures,
which of the "yellow area" events has a 20% chance of happening opon observing the actual outcome of the experiment?

### !end-question
### !options

* (a) disjoint
* (b) empty
* (c) plus
* (d) whole
* (e) other

### !end-options
### !answer
(c) plus
### !end-answer
### !explanation

Since there are 25 total squares representing 25 possible events 
in the sample space, and each square is the same size (and we're assuming uniform randomness over the outcomes),
the event in figure (c) has a 20% chance of happening since it is comprised of 5 squares.  
I.e., 5 squares of 4% make up 20%.

**Fun Fact:** the collection of events that do not overlap but together comprise the whole of an event 
are referred to as a _partition_ of the event. 

**Fun Fact:** the "non-overlapping" nature of any two event members of a partition is referred to as _mutual exclusivity_,
which means that a single outcome \\(x\\) can only actualize at most one of the two events. I.e., only one or the other (at most) 
of two _mutually exclusive_ events can have occured once a single outcome \\(x\\) is observed. This is of course because if 
two events are "non-overlapping" then a single \\(x\\) cannot be in both!

* (d) We don't have enough information to know

### !end-options
### !answer
\\(Pr(E_1) = 1, and Pr(E_2) = 0\\)
### !end-answer
### !explanation

Answer (a) is a correct statement since every outcome \\(x\\) is in \\(S_X\\) and no outcome \\(x\\) is in \\(\emptyset\\).
Thus, when \\(x\\) is realized from experiment \\(X\\) the event \\(S\\) will have happened and the event \\(\emptyset\\).
Thus, there is a 100% chance that event \\(S\\) will occur and a 0% chance that event \\(\emptyset\\) will occur; or,
eqivalently stated, \\(Pr(S_X) = 1, and Pr(\emptyset) = 0\\).

**Fun Fact:** \\(Pr(S_X) = 1, and Pr(\emptyset) = 0\\) are basic axioms of probability theory -- all experiments that 
behave probabilistically must satisfy these properties. 

The correct answer of course is (c), however, since the problem asked you to specifiy probabilities of events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) occuring.

## Set Arithmatic

### Basics

Using _set operator notation_ we can construct new events on the basis of events we already have.  
The standard set operators are 

- _Complement_: \\(E_1^C\\)

- _Union_: \\(E_1 \cup E_2\\)

- _Intersection_: \\(E_1 \cap E_2\\)

and their corresponding operations are demonstrated in the following figures, known as _Venn diagrams_:

>![uniform continuous](./images/uniform_cont.png)


### De Morgan's laws

Naturally, such operations can be combined together in increasingly complex ways, as desired.  
For example, --------- or ---------, or --------- or ---------.  Now interestingly, 
it turns out that those previous expressions were actually redundant, 
as the following tautologies -- known as _De Morgan's laws_ -- indicate: 

(a) ---------

and 

(b) ---------

While De Morgan's laws look truly complex, they're actually pretty easy little 
rules that just demonstrate the flexibility of expression available using set notation.  
De Morgan's laws can be explained graphically using the following Venn diagram:

>![uniform continuous](./images/uniform_cont.png)

<div class='bg-info' style='padding:8px;border-style:solid;border-width:2px;border-color:#00BFFF'>
<strong>Aside:</strong><br>
It is a general rule in mathematics that the notation needed to precisely state mathematical notions 
can be extremely dense and challenging. Even if the meaning and idea is not that difficult, for example 
as is the case with De Morgan's laws.   One might at least then hope that once careful and precise
notation has expressed a meaning, the result will at least look astethically pleasing! But even this may not always be the case.
The truth is that mathematical notation is a form of expression -- a language -- that is learned the way every other
language is learned: through practice, practice, and more practice.  It's all about being familiar with the 
meaning and usage of notation.  Notation is not something that mathematical geniuses understand by mere viture of 
the application of their.  Rather, mathematical geniuses learn to express their clever and insightful (and often very simple) 
ideas using the rich and precise language of expression that mathematical notation provides.  So don't freak out when you
see some new mathematical notation!  Just set about understanding what it means and how it's used!

### Partitions and mutual exclusivity

As referenced previously in _Question 1_, 
a collection of events \\(E_1, E_2, \cdots, E_m\\) that do not overlap but together comprise the whole of a 
event \\(E\\), i.e., \\(E = \overset{m}{\underset{i=1}{\cup}}E_i\\)  are referred to as a _partition_ of event \\(E\\).
Now, as also noted in _Question 1_, the notion of "non-overlapping" \\(E_i\\) and \\(E_j\\) is referred to as 
_mutual exclusivity_ and two events \\(E_i\\) and \\(E_j\\) are said to be _mutually exclusive_ if \\(E_i \cap E_j = \emptyset\\),
where \\(\emptyset\\) is the event containing no outcomes. Thus, if two events \\(E_i\\) and \\(E_j\\) are mutually exclusive
then for any outcome \\(x\\), at most one of evets \\(E_i\\) and \\(E_j\\) will have occured.

(b) \\(Pr(E_1) + Pr(E_2) - Pr(E_1 \cap E_2)\\)
### !end-answer
### !explanation

Answers (a) and (b) add together too much probability.
Answer (c) is correct if \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) ARE mutually exclusive.
The correct answer adds the individual probabilities for events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) and then 
subtracts the probability \\(Pr(E_1 \cap E_2)\\) of the intersection event \\(E_1 \cap E_2\\)
because it was double counted by \\(Pr(E_1) + Pr(E_2)\\). 

**Fun Fact:** This answer is actually true regardless of whether or not the outcomes are uniformly random or not. 

**Fun Fact:** Answer (c) shows that for mutually exclusive events \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) \\(Pr(E_1 \cap E_2) = Pr(\emptyset) = 0\\), which of course makes since
because if the experiment is run then some \\(x\\) is going to be observed.

**Fun Fact:** \\(Pr(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3) = Pr(E_1) + Pr(E_2) + Pr(E_3) - Pr(E_1 \cap E_2) - Pr(E_1 \cap E_3) - Pr(E_2 \cap E_3) + - Pr(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap E_3)\\)

## Formal Set Notation

Venn diagrams are a very nice tool to represent events (sets of outcomes) 
and visualize event probabilities.  But there is also a more formal mathematical set notaion that 
is important to understand.  Namely, for two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we specify the following operations as follows: 

 Operation | Mathematical Notation | Meaning
----|----|----
**Union** | \\( A \cup B = \\{ x: x \in A \cup x\in B \\} \\) | The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is equal to all \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is in \\(A\\) or \\(x\\) is in \\(B\\)
**Intersection** | \\( A \cap B = \\{x: x \in A \cap x\in B\\}\\) | The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is equal to \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is in both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)
**Difference** | \\( A \setminus B = \\{x: x \in A \cap x \notin B\\}\\) | The difference of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is equal to \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is in \\(A\\) but \\(x\\) is not in \\(B\\)
**Complement** | \\( A^C = \\{x: x\notin A\\} \\) | The complement of \\(A\\) is equal to \\(x\\) such that \\(x\\) is not in \\(A\\)
**null (empty) set** | \\( \emptyset \\) | The null set is empty. It contains no elements.
