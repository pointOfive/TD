In command line on the ec2 server:

Edit your crontab with this command:

export EDITOR=nano
crontab -e
And add this line to the bottom

@reboot cd ~/Notebook; source ~/.bashrc; ~/anaconda2/bin/jupyter notebook >>~/cronrun.log 2>&1


Save, quit, and reboot. with

sudo reboot

Note: you get charged a full hour every time you start an AWS instance. I don't think you get charged for just doing a reboot.
