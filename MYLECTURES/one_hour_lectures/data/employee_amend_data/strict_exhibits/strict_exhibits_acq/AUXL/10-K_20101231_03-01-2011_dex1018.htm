whereas, the company and executive previously entered into that certain amended and restated employment agreement dated december 17,
2008 (the prior agreement); and  whereas, the parties now wish to amend the terms of the prior agreement to remove
the gross-up provision on excess parachute payments within the meaning of section 280g of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended and clarify certain payment timing provisions; and 
whereas, in consideration for the removal of the gross-up provision in the prior agreement executive will be entitled to certain enhanced
severance benefits as set forth in this agreement.  now, therefore, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:  1. employment. the company hereby agrees to continue to employ executive, and executive hereby accepts such
continued employment and agrees to perform executives duties and responsibilities, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth. this agreement shall be effective as of december 23, 2010 (the
effective date) and shall continue until the third anniversary thereof, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this agreement (the initial term). in addition, this agreement shall automatically renew for periods of
one (1) year unless either party gives written notice to the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term or any one (1) year renewal period, as applicable, that this agreement shall not be further
extended. nothing in this agreement shall be construed as giving executive any right to be retained in the employ of the company, and executive specifically acknowledges that executive shall be an employee-at-will of the company, and thus subject to
discharge at any time by the company with or without cause (as defined in section 2.9) and without compensation of any nature except as provided in section 2 below. the initial term, together with any one-year renewal period shall be
referred to as the term.  1.1 duties and responsibilities. commencing on the effective date, executive

executives best efforts to carry out executives duties and responsibilities under section 1.1 hereof and, consistent with the other provisions of this agreement, to devote substantially all of executives business time,
attention and energy thereto. the foregoing shall not be construed as preventing executive from making investments in other businesses or enterprises, provided that executive agrees not to become engaged in any other business activity which, in the
reasonable judgment of the board, is likely to interfere with executives ability to discharge executives duties and responsibilities to the company.

compensation is earned.  1.5 retirement and welfare plans. executive shall participate in employee retirement and
welfare benefit plans made available to the companys senior level executives as a group or to its employees generally, as such retirement and welfare plans may be in effect from time to time and subject to the eligibility requirements of the

provision of this agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the timing of executives execution of the release, directly or indirectly, result in executive designating the calendar year of payment, and if a payment that is subject to

that any payment or distribution by the company to or for the benefit of executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this agreement or otherwise (total payments) to be made to executive
would otherwise exceed the amount (the safe harbor amount) that could be received by executive without the imposition of an excise tax under section 4999 of code, then the total payments shall be reduced to the extent, and only to
the extent, necessary to assure that their aggregate present value, as determined in accordance the applicable provisions of section 280g of the code and the regulations thereunder, does not exceed the greater of the following dollar amounts
(the benefit limit):  (i) the safe harbor amount, or

independent public accounting firm selected by the company before the date of the change of control (the accounting firm). in determining whether such benefit limit is exceeded, the accounting firm shall make a reasonable determination
of the value to be assigned to the restrictive covenants in effect for executive pursuant to sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this agreement, and the amount of his or her potential parachute payment under section 280g of the code shall reduced by the
value of those restrictive covenants to the extent consistent with section 280g of the code and the regulations thereunder.

executive. notwithstanding the foregoing any reduction shall be made in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 409a of the code and where two economically equivalent amounts are subject to reduction but payable at different times, such
amounts shall be reduced on a pro rata basis but not below zero.  (d) all of the fees and expenses of the accounting firm in
performing the determinations referred to in this section 2.3 shall be borne solely by the company. the company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the accounting firm from any and all claims, damages and expenses resulting from or relating
to its determinations pursuant to this section 2.3, except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the accounting firm. 
2.4 voluntary termination. executive may voluntarily terminate executives employment for any reason upon 30 days prior
written notice. in such event, after the effective date of such termination, except as provided in section 2.2 with respect to a resignation for good reason, no further payments shall be due under this agreement, except that executive shall be
entitled to any benefits accrued in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the company. 
2.5 disability. subject to requirements of applicable law, the company may terminate executives employment if executive has
been unable to perform the material duties of executives employment for a period of 90 days in any 12-month period because of physical or mental injury or illness (disability); provided, however, that the company shall continue to
pay executives base salary until the company acts to terminate executives employment. executive agrees, in the event of a dispute under this section 2.5 relating to executives disability, to submit to a physical examination by
a licensed physician jointly selected by the board and executive. if the company terminates executives employment for disability, no further payments shall be due under this agreement, except that executive shall be entitled to any benefits
accrued in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and programs of the company.  2.6 death. if
executive dies while employed by the company, the company shall pay to executives executor, legal representative, administrator or designated beneficiary, as 
  5 



applicable, any benefits accrued under the companys benefit plans and programs. otherwise, the company shall have no further liability or obligation under this agreement to executives
executors, legal representatives, administrators, heirs or assigns or any other person claiming under or through executive. 
2.7 cause. the company may terminate executives employment at any time for cause (as defined in section 2.9) upon
written notice to executive, in which event all payments under this agreement shall cease. executive shall be entitled to any benefits accrued before executives termination in accordance with the terms of any applicable benefit plans and
programs of the company.  2.8 notice of termination. any termination of executives employment shall be
communicated by a written notice of termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with section 11. the notice of termination shall (i) indicate the specific termination provision in this agreement relied upon, (ii) briefly
summarize the facts and circumstances deemed to provide a basis for a termination of employment and the applicable provision hereof, and (iii) specify the termination date in accordance with the requirements of this agreement. 
2.9 definitions.  (a) cause shall mean any of the following grounds for termination of executives employment:  (i) executive shall have been convicted of, or entered a plea of guilty to, a felony,  (ii) executive intentionally and continually fails to perform executives reasonably assigned material duties to the company (other than a failure resulting from executives incapacity due to
physical or mental illness), which failure has continued for a period of at least 30 days after a written notice of demand for substantial performance, signed by a duly authorized officer of the company, has been delivered to executive specifying
the manner in which executive has failed substantially to perform,  (iii) executive engages in willful misconduct in the
performance of executives duties, or  (iv) executive materially breaches section 4, 5, 6 or 7 below. 
(b) change of control as used herein, a change of control shall be deemed to have occurred if: 
(i) any person (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the
exchange act)) becomes a beneficial owner (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the company representing more than 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
securities of the company; provided that a change of control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of a transaction in which the company becomes a subsidiary of another corporation and in which the stockholders of the company, immediately prior
to the transaction, will beneficially own, 
  6 



immediately after the transaction, shares entitling such stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of the parent corporation would be entitled in the election of
directors;  (ii) the consummation of (a) a merger or consolidation of the company with another corporation where the
stockholders of the company, immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, will not beneficially own, immediately after the merger or consolidation, shares entitling such stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of
the surviving corporation would be entitled in the election of directors or (b) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; or  (iii) after the effective date, directors are elected such that a majority of the members of the board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by
a majority of the members of the board prior to the date of the appointment or election.  (c) good reason
shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions, unless executive has expressly consented in writing thereto, or except as a result of executives physical or mental incapacity or as described in the last sentence of this
subsection (c):  (i) a material reduction in executives base salary; 
(ii) a substantial reduction of executives duties and responsibilities hereunder; or 
(iii) the company requires that executives principal office location be moved to a location more than 50 miles from
executives principal office location immediately before the change.  notwithstanding the foregoing, executive shall not have good reason
for termination unless (a) executive gives written notice of termination for good reason within 30 days after the event giving rise to good reason occurs, (b) the company does not correct the action or failure to act that constitutes the
grounds for good reason, as set forth in executives notice of termination, within 30 days after the date on which executive gives written notice of termination and (c) executive actually resigns within 60 days following the expiration of
the cure period.  2.10 section 409a.  (a) this agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under section 409a of the code. if any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring
sanctions under section 409a of the code, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full (to extent not paid in part at earlier date) at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. for purposes of section 409a of
the code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this agreement may only be made upon executives separation from service (within the meaning of such term under section 409a of the code), each payment made
under this agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, and the right to a series of installment payments under this agreement shall be 
  7 



treated as a right to a series of separate payments. in no event shall executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment, except as permitted under section 409a of the
code.  (b) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, at the time of executives separation from service with
the company, the company has securities which are publicly traded on an established securities market and executive is a specified employee (as such term is defined in section 409a of the code) and it is necessary to postpone the
commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable under this agreement as a result of such separation from service prevent any accelerated or additional tax under section 409a of the code, then the company will postpone the commencement of
the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to executive) that are not otherwise paid within the short-term deferral exception under treas. reg.
§1.409a-1(b)(4), and the separation pay exception under treas. reg. §1.409a-1(b)(9)(iii), until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six months following executives separation from service
with the company. if any payments are postponed due to such requirements, such postponed amounts will be paid in a lump sum to executive on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six months following executives separation of
service with the company. if executive dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of section 409a of the code shall be paid to the personal representative of executives estate
within 60 days after the date of executives death.  (c) all reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this
agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409a of the code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (a) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during executives lifetime (or
during a shorter period of time specified in this agreement), (b) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind
benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year, (c) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (d) the right to
reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  3. non-exclusivity of rights. nothing
in this agreement shall prevent or limit executives continuing or future participation in or rights under any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the company and for which executive may qualify; provided, however,
that if executive becomes entitled to and receives the payments provided for in section 2 of this agreement, executive hereby waives executives right to receive payments under any severance plan or similar program applicable to all
employees of the company.  4. confidentiality. executive agrees that executives services to the company and its subsidiaries and
any successors or assigns (collectively, the employer) were and are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and that executives position places executive in a position of confidence and trust with the employers
customers and employees. executive also recognizes that executives position with the employer will give executive substantial access to confidential information (as defined below), the disclosure of which to competitors of the

  8 



employer would cause the employer to suffer substantial and irreparable damage. executive recognizes, therefore, that it is in the employers legitimate business interest to restrict
executives use of confidential information for any purposes other than the discharge of executives employment duties at the employer, and to limit any potential appropriation of confidential information by executive for the benefit of
the employers competitors and to the detriment of the employer. accordingly, executive agrees as follows:  (a) executive
will not at any time, whether during or after the termination of executives employment, reveal to any person or entity any of the trade secrets or confidential information of the employer or of any third party which the employer is under an
obligation to keep confidential (including but not limited to trade secrets or confidential information respecting inventions, products, designs, methods, know-how, techniques, systems, processes, software programs, works of authorship, customer
lists, projects, plans and proposals) (confidential information), except as may be required in the ordinary course of performing executives duties as an employee of the employer, and executive shall keep secret all matters
entrusted to executive and shall not use or attempt to use any such information in any manner which may injure or cause loss or may be calculated to injure or cause loss whether directly or indirectly to the employer. 
(b) the above restrictions shall not apply to: (i) information that at the time of disclosure is in the public domain through no
fault of executive; (ii) information received from a third party outside of the employer that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iii) information approved for release by written authorization of the
employer; or (iv) information that may be required by law or an order of any court, agency or proceeding to be disclosed; provided executive shall provide the employer notice of any such required disclosure once executive has knowledge of it
and will help the employer to the extent reasonable to obtain an appropriate protective order.  (c) further, executive agrees
that during executives employment executive shall not take, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature
relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the employer or concerning any of its dealings or affairs otherwise than for the benefit of the employer. executive further agrees that executive shall not, after the termination of
executives employment, use or permit to be used any such notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials, it being agreed that all of the foregoing shall
be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the employer and that, immediately upon the termination of executives employment, executive shall deliver all of the foregoing, and all copies thereof, to the employer, at its main office.
 (d) executive agrees that upon the termination of executives employment with the employer, executive will not take or
retain without written authorization any documents, files or other property of the employer, and executive will return promptly to the employer any such documents, files or property in executives possession or custody, including any copies
thereof maintained in any medium or format. executive recognizes that all documents, files and property which executive has received and will receive from the employer, including but not limited to scientific research, customer lists, handbooks,
memoranda, product 
  9 



specifications, and other materials (with the exception of documents relating to benefits to which executive might be entitled following the termination of executives employment with the
employer), are for the exclusive use of the employer and employees who are discharging their responsibilities on behalf of the employer, and that executive has no claim or right to the continued use, possession or custody of such documents, files or
property following the termination of executives employment with the employer.  5. intellectual property. 
(a) if at any time or times during executives employment executive shall (either alone or with others) make, conceive, discover or
reduce to practice any invention, modification, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, software program, work of authorship, documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, secret or intellectual property right whatsoever or any
interest therein (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes or subject to analogous protection) (herein called developments) that (i) relates to the business of the employer or any customer of or
supplier to the employer or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured or sold by the employer or which may be used in relation therewith, (ii) results from tasks assigned to executive by the employer or (iii) results
from the use of premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the employer, such developments and the benefits thereof shall immediately become the sole and absolute property of the employer and
its assigns, and executive shall promptly disclose to the employer (or any persons designated by it) each such development, and executive hereby assigns any rights executive may have or acquire in the developments and benefits and/or rights
resulting therefrom to the employer and its assigns without further compensation and shall communicate, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto (with all necessary plans and models) to the
employer.  (b) upon disclosure of each development to the employer, executive will, during executives employment and at
any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the employer, sign, execute, make and do all such deeds, documents, acts and things as the employer and its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: 
(i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the employer alone (unless the employer otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights
or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and  (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous
protection.  (c) in the event the employer is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure executives signature on any
letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to a development, whether because of executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
employer and its duly authorized officers and agents as executives agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on 
  10 



executives behalf and stead to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letter patents,
copyright and other analogous protection thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by executive.  6. non-competition.
while executive is employed at the employer and for a period of one (1) year after termination of executives employment (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or involuntarily), executive will not, without the prior written
approval of the board, whether alone or as a partner, officer, director, consultant, agent, employee or stockholder of any company or other commercial enterprise, directly or indirectly engage in any business or other activity in the united states
or canada which competes with the employer in the sale of the pharmaceutical or other products being manufactured, marketed, distributed or developed by the employer while executive is employed by employer and at the time of termination of such
employment. the foregoing prohibition shall not prevent executives employment or engagement after termination of executives employment by any company or business organization, as long as the activities of any such employment or
engagement, in any capacity, do not involve work on matters related to the products being developed, manufactured, or marketed by the employer at the time of termination of executives employment. executive shall be permitted to own securities
of a public company not in excess of five percent of any class of such securities and to own stock, partnership interests or other securities of any entity not in excess of five percent of any class of such securities and such ownership shall not be
considered to be in competition with the employer.  7. non-solicitation. 
(a) while executive is employed at the employer and for a period of one (1) year after termination of such employment (for any
reason, whether voluntary or involuntarily), executive agrees that executive will not:  (i) directly or indirectly solicit,
entice or induce any customer to become a customer of any other person, firm or corporation with respect to products then sold or under development by the employer or to cease doing business with the employer, and executive shall not approach any
such person, firm or corporation for such purpose or authorize or knowingly approve the taking of such actions by any other person; or  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the employer to work for a third party other than the employer (excluding newspaper or similar print or electronic solicitations of general
circulation).  (b) this section 7 does not apply to any general solicitation not focused to any group of customers
itemized on a customer list of the employer.  8. general provisions. 
(a) executive acknowledges and agrees that the type and periods of restrictions imposed in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of this agreement are
fair and reasonable, and that such restrictions are intended solely to protect the legitimate interests of the employer, rather than to prevent executive from earning a livelihood. executive recognizes that the employer

  11 



competes worldwide, and that executives access to confidential information makes it necessary for the employer to restrict executives post-employment activities in any market in which
the employer competes, and in which executives access to confidential information and other proprietary information could be used to the detriment of the employer. in the event that any restriction set forth in this agreement is determined to
be overbroad with respect to scope, time or geographical coverage, executive agrees that such a restriction or restrictions should be modified and narrowed, either by a court or by the employer, so as to preserve and protect the legitimate interests
of the employer as described in this agreement, and without negating or impairing any other restrictions or agreements set forth herein.  (b) executive acknowledges and agrees that if executive should breach any of the covenants, restrictions and agreements contained herein, irreparable loss and injury would result to the employer, and that
damages arising out of such a breach may be difficult to ascertain. executive therefore agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law or at equity, the employer shall be entitled to have the covenants, restrictions and agreements
contained in sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 specifically enforced (including, without limitation, by temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions and restraining orders) by any state or federal court in the commonwealth of pennsylvania having equity
jurisdiction and executive agrees to subject executive to the jurisdiction of such court.  (c) executive agrees that if the
