under this agreement or any other agreement providing for obligations to survive executives termination of employment.

adverse tax consequences to executive under section 409a of the code, if executive is deemed to be a specified employee for purposes of section 409a(a)(2)(b) of the code, executive agrees that the payments due to him or her
under this section 4 in connection with a termination of employment that would otherwise have been payable at any time during the six-month period immediately following such termination of employment shall not be paid prior to, and shall

executive pursuant to this section 4, including, without limitation, any excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the code.  (i) no mitigation. executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any
payment or benefit provided for in this section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by executive as the result of employment by another employer or self-employment or by retirement benefits; provided, however, that loans, advances or other
amounts owed by executive to the company may be offset by the company against amounts payable to executive under this section 4; provided, further, that, as provided in sections 4(c) or (d), executives right to continued
healthcare and life insurance benefits following his or her termination of employment will terminate on the date on which he or she accepts employment with another employer that provides comparable benefits in terms of cost and scope of coverage.
 (j) return of the companys property. if executives employment is terminated for any reason, the company
shall have the right, at its option, to require executive to vacate his or her offices prior to or on the effective date of termination and to cease all activities on the companys behalf. upon the termination of his or her employment in any
manner, as a condition to the executives receipt of any post-termination benefits described in this agreement, executive shall immediately surrender to the company all lists, books and records of, or in connection with, the companys
business, and all other property belonging to the company, it being distinctly understood that all such lists, books and records, and other documents, are the property of the company. executive shall deliver to the company a signed statement
certifying compliance with this section 4 (j) prior to the receipt of any post-termination benefits described in this agreement.

executive shall hold the company harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including but not limited to, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees, which executive may incur as a result of the
termination of executives employment. executive further agrees that executive shall bring no claim or cause of action against the company for damages or injunctive relieve based on a wrongful termination of employment. executive agrees that
the sole liability of the company to executive upon termination of this agreement shall be that determined by this section 4. in the event this covenant is more restrictive than permitted by laws of the jurisdiction in which the company seeks
enforcement thereof, this covenant shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.  5. certain covenants. 
(a) noncompetition. except as may otherwise be approved by the board, during the term of executives employment, executive
shall not have any ownership interest (of record or beneficial) in, or have any interest as an employee, salesman, consultant, officer or director in, or 
  10 



otherwise aid or assist in any manner, any firm, corporation, partnership, proprietorship or other business that engages in any county, city or part thereof in the united states and/or any
foreign country in a business which competes directly or indirectly (as determined by the board) with the companys business in such county, city or part thereof, so long as the company, or any successor in interest of the company to the
business and goodwill of the company, remains engaged in such business in such county, city or part thereof or continues to solicit customers or potential customers therein; provided, however, that executive may own, directly or
indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any entity which are traded on any national securities exchange if executive (x) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such entity; or (y) does not,
directly or indirectly, own one percent (1%) or more of any class of securities of any such entity.  (b) confidential
information. executive and the company have entered into the companys standard employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement (the employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement). executive
agrees to perform each and every obligation of executive therein contained.  (c) solicitation of employees. executive
shall not during the term of executives employment and for the applicable severance period for which executive receives severance benefits following any termination hereof pursuant to section 4(c) or (d) above (regardless of whether
executive receives such severance benefits in a lump sum payment) (the restricted period), directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage to leave the employment of the company or any of its affiliates, any employee of the company
or any of its affiliates.  (d) rights and remedies upon breach. if executive breaches or threatens to commit a breach
of any of the provisions of this section 5 (the restrictive covenants), the company shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of the other and severally enforceable,
and all of which rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the company under law or in equity:  (i) specific performance. the right and remedy to have the restrictive covenants specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, all without the need to post a bond or any other
security or to prove any amount of actual damage or that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the company and that money
damages will not provide adequate remedy to the company; and  (ii) accounting and indemnification. the right and
remedy to require executive (i) to account for and pay over to the company all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by executive or any associated party deriving such benefits as a result of
any such breach of the restrictive covenants; and (ii) to indemnify the company against any other losses, damages (including special and consequential damages), costs and expenses, including actual attorneys fees and court costs, which
may be incurred by them and which result from or arise out of any such breach or threatened breach of the restrictive covenants. 
  11 


(e) severability of covenants/blue penciling. if any court determines that any of the
restrictive covenants, or any part thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the restrictive covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid portions. if any court determines that
any of the restrictive covenants, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration or area of such provision and, in its reduced

(i) to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under section 409a, executive shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the company for purposes of this agreement and no payment shall
be due to executive under this agreement until executive would be considered to have incurred a separation from service from the company within the meaning of section 409a; and (ii) each amount to be paid or benefit to be
provided to executive pursuant to this agreement, which constitute deferred compensation subject to section 409a, shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of section 409a. to the extent required to avoid an
accelerated or additional tax under section 409a, amounts reimbursable to executive under this agreement shall be paid to executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of

any taxes which executive would become entitled to under the terms of this agreement, the payment of such reimbursements shall be made by the company no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which executive remits
