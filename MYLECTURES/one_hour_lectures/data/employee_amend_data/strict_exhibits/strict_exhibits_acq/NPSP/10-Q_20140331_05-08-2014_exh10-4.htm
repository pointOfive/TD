revenue code of 1986, as amended ("code") (and any regulations and guidelines issued thereunder) to the extent this agreement is otherwise
subject thereto, and this agreement shall be interpreted consistent with the requirements of section 409a of the code or an applicable exception thereto.  if any
compensation or benefits provided by this agreement may result in the application of section 409a of the code, the company shall, in consultation with the

after the executive's termination of employment, and such payments that would otherwise be payable during the six (6) month period following the executive's
termination of employment shall be paid in a lump sum in the seventh month following such effective date of termination of employment.  for purposes hereof,
"specified employee" shall mean any company employee that the company determines is a specified employee within the meaning of section 409a
of the code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  all reimbursable expenses, any other reimbursements, and in kind benefits, including any third-party
payments, provided under this agreement (or any of the documents incorporated herein by reference) will be made or provided in accordance with the
requirements of section 409a of the code.  notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the timing of the executive's
execution of the release described in section ix.f., directly or indirectly, result in the executive designating the calendar year of payment of an amount that is
subject to section 409a of the code, and if a payment that is



                                                    10





subject to execution of the release and is subject to section 409a of the code could be made in
more than one taxable year, payment shall be made in the later taxable year to the extent required to comply with section 409a of the code.

any capacity.  the company reserves the right to terminate employee's employment at any time for any reason.

non-competition.


8.1	the employee understands and agrees  that the company's activities, including its interests in confidential information and
intellectual property, are of a proprietary, unique and special nature and that if employee's services were used in competition with the company, such use could
cause serious and possibly irreparable harm to the company.  accordingly, employee agrees to the commitments of non-competitive activities as described
herein.

8.1.1	employee agrees that during the period of employment with the company and for a period of one year thereafter, employee
shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, shareholder, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, engage, participate, assist or invest
in any business whose products or activities complete in whole or in part with the products or activities of the company anywhere in the world, provide, however,
that this does not apply to investments in mutual funds, or in public companies where the employee's investment is less than one (1%) of the outstanding stock of
a publicly held corporation or five percent (5%) of the employee's total liquid assets.
8.1.2	employee agrees that during the period of employment with the company, and for a period of one year thereafter, employee

no use of other's intellectual property.

employee represents to the company that employee has not brought and has not used, and agrees that it will not bring to the company
and will not use in the performance of any responsibilities for the company, any information, materials or the like which are confidential and are proprietary to a
former employer or to some other person or entity without written authorization from said former employer, person or entity.
injunctive relief.

employee agrees that, because of the unique nature of this agreement and the obligations of employee regarding non-disclosure, non-
use and assignment of inventions and intellectual property, monetary damages alone will be an inadequate remedy for employee's breach of such obligations.
as a result, employee agrees that the company shall be entitled to obtain injunctive and other equitable relief to protect the confidential nature of its confidential
information and its interest in such inventions and intellectual property, in addition to all other remedies which may be available at law or otherwise.
miscellaneous.


11.1 	if any provision of this agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the same
shall be deemed severed from the remainder of this agreement and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this agreement.
however, if the provisions of section 8 above are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because of its temporal or geographic
limitation(s), the parties agree that any such court may modify such limitation(s) so as to render it/them enforceable.
11.2	this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of new jersey without reference to the conflicts of law principles
thereof.
11.3	this agreement constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between the company and employee concerning the
subject matter of this agreement and supersedes all prior representations, agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, between
the company and employee with respect thereto.  in the event employee and the company have previously entered into an agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof, this agreement is considered a novation of that agreement.  employee agrees that all confidential information received by employee prior to the
"date of hire" shown below is governed hereby and is deemed received pursuant to the terms hereof.  any inventions excluded by employee thereunder are also
deemed excluded hereunder unless stated otherwise in exhibit a hereof.  any modification, recision or amendment of this agreement shall not be effective unless
made in writing and executed by both parties.

if no inventions, ideas, discoveries or other items of intellectual property are identified in the space above, then employee represents that
there are no such inventions, ideas, discoveries or other items of intellectual property.

11.5.1	continued employment with the company;
11.5.2	compensation paid to the employee by the company from time to time; and

hire the agreement is intended to relate back to the employee's date of hire and to be part of the terms of initial employment.

exhibit b


indemnity agreement

this agreement, effective the [____] day of [ ________________ ,  _______ ], by and between nps pharmaceuticals, inc., a delaware corporation (the
"corporation"), and eric pauwels, the undersigned agent of the corporation ("agent").
 recitals
whereas, agent performs a valuable service to the corporation in the capacity as an officer of the corporation;
whereas, the stockholders of the corporation have adopted bylaws (the "bylaws") providing for the indemnification of the directors, officers,
employees, and other agents of the corporation, including persons serving at the request of the corporation in such capacities with other corporations or
enterprises, as authorized by the delaware general corporation law, as amended (the "code");
whereas, the bylaws and the code, by their non-exclusive nature, permit contracts between the corporation and its agents, officers, employees, and other
agents with respect to indemnification of such persons; and
whereas, in order to induce agent to continue to serve as an officer of the corporation, the corporation has determined and agreed to enter into this
agreement with agent;
now, therefore, in consideration of agent's continued service as an officer after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows:

services to the corporation. with duties beginning as of the above date, agent will serve, at the will of the corporation or under separate contract, if
any such contract exists, as an officer of the corporation or as a director, officer or other fiduciary of an affiliate of the corporation (including any employee benefit
plan of the corporation) faithfully and to the best of agent's ability so long as agent is duly elected and qualified or appointed in accordance with the provisions of
the bylaws or other applicable charter documents of the corporation or such affiliate; provided, however, that agent may at any time and for any reason resign
from such position (subject to any contractual obligation that agent may have assumed apart from this agreement) and that the corporation or any affiliate shall
have no obligation under this agreement to continue agent in any such position.
indemnity of agent. the corporation hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify agent to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by the
provisions of the bylaws, the code, and applicable law as the same may be amended from time to time (but, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than the bylaws, the code, or applicable law permitted prior to adoption of such amendment).

additional indemnity. in addition to and not in limitation of the indemnification otherwise provided for herein, and subject only to the exclusions set
forth in section 4 hereof, the corporation hereby further agrees to hold harmless and indemnify agent:


against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), witness fees, damages, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, and any other amounts that agent becomes


                                                    1





legally obligated to pay because of any claim or claims made against or by agent in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, arbitrational, administrative, or investigative (including an action by or in the right of the corporation) to which
agent is, was or at any time becomes a party, or is threatened to be made a party, by reason of the fact that agent is, was or at any time becomes a director,
officer, employee or other agent of corporation, or is or was serving or at any time serves at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
other agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise; and
otherwise to the fullest extent as may be provided to agent by the corporation under the non-exclusivity provisions of the code and section 11.5 of the
bylaws.
limitations on additional indemnity. no indemnity shall be paid by the corporation under this agreement:


on account of any claim against agent for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by agent of securities of the corporation pursuant to the
provisions of section 16(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law;

on account of agent's conduct that was knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest or that constituted willful misconduct;

on account of agent's conduct that constituted a breach of agent's duty of loyalty to the corporation or resulted in any personal profit or advantage to which
agent was not legally entitled;

for which payment is actually made to agent under a valid and collectible insurance policy or under a valid and enforceable indemnity clause, bylaw or
agreement, except in respect of any excess beyond payment under such insurance, clause, bylaw or agreement;

if indemnification is not lawful (and, in this respect, both the corporation and agent have been advised that the securities and exchange commission
believes that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable and that claims for
indemnification should be submitted to appropriate courts for adjudication); or

in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by agent, or any proceeding by agent against the corporation or its directors, officers, employees
or other agents, unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the board of directors
of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under
the code, or (iv) the proceeding is initiated pursuant to section 9 hereof.
continuation of indemnity. all agreements and obligations of the corporation contained herein shall continue during the period agent is a director,
officer, employee or other agent of the corporation (or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or other agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise) and shall continue thereafter so long as agent shall be subject to any
possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,


                                                    2




arbitrational, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that agent was serving in the capacity referred to herein.
partial indemnification. agent shall be entitled under this agreement to indemnification by the corporation for a portion of the expenses (including
attorneys' fees), witness fees, damages, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, and any other amounts that agent becomes legally obligated to pay in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding referred to in section 3 hereof even if not entitled hereunder to indemnification for the total amount thereof,
and the corporation shall indemnify agent for the portion thereof to which agent is entitled.

notification and defense of claim. not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by agent of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or
proceeding, agent will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the corporation under this agreement, notify the corporation or confirm that the
corporation has notice of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify or so to confirm notice to the corporation will not relieve it from any liability
which it may have to agent otherwise than under this agreement. with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding as to which agent notifies the corporation of
the commencement thereof or confirms that the corporation has such notice:


the corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense;

except as otherwise provided below, the corporation may, at its option and jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified and electing to assume
such defense, assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to agent. after notice from the corporation to agent of its election to assume the
defense thereof, the corporation will not be liable to agent under this agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by agent in connection
with the defense thereof except for reasonable costs of investigation or otherwise as provided below. agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
such action, suit or proceeding but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall
be at the expense of agent unless (i) the employment of counsel by agent has been authorized by the corporation, (ii) agent shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the corporation (or any other agent or agents for whom the corporation has assumed or may assume
the defense) and agent in the conduct of the defense of such action; or (iii) the corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense
of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of agent's separate counsel shall be at the expense of the corporation. the corporation shall not
be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the corporation or as to which agent shall have made the
conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above; and

the corporation shall not be liable to indemnify agent under this agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any action or claim effected without its
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. the corporation shall be permitted to settle any action except that it shall not settle any action or claim
in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on agent without agent's written consent, which may be given or withheld in agent's sole
discretion.

                                                    3



expenses. promptly following request for advancement of expenses and upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of agent to repay said
amounts on the terms hereof, the corporation shall advance, prior to the final disposition of any proceeding, all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by
agent in connection with such proceeding, prior to the date (if at all) when the corporation has determined that agent has acted in bad faith or in a manner that
agent did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, that agent is not entitled to indemnification due to exclusion under section 4
hereof or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that agent acted without reasonable cause to believe that agent's conduct was lawful. such
determination may be made by the corporation upon a finding that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made, clearly
and convincingly support such a determination. such determination may be made by the corporation (i) as to an officer by a vote of all disinterested directors
provided such directors constitute a quorum of the board of directors; or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, upon direction of a majority
of the disinterested directors as to an officer or director by independent legal counsel (selected by said majority, or other representation of the corporation, from a
panel of five alternates approved for this purpose by the national association of corporate directors) in a written opinion. this provision is adopted under and is
to be interpreted consistent with delaware code 145(f) and bylaw 11.5.

enforcement.


any right to indemnification or advances granted by this agreement to agent shall be enforceable by or on behalf of agent in any court of competent
jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90)
days of request therefor. agent, in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting agent's
claim. it shall be a defense to any action for which a claim for indemnification is made under section 3 hereof (other than an action brought to enforce a
claim for expenses pursuant to section 8 hereof, provided that the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that agent is not entitled to
indemnification because of the limitations set forth in section 4 hereof.   neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such enforcement action that indemnification of agent is proper in the circumstances,
nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors or its stockholders) that such indemnification is improper shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that agent is not entitled to indemnification under this agreement or otherwise.

any determination, election, or authorization (a "determination") permitted or required herein to be made by the corporation when made by the
board of directors, shall be made in the manner set out in the following sentence when the determination is (i) to authorize agent to initiate a proceeding against
the corporation under paragraph 4(f) hereof; (ii) to participate in a proceeding under paragraph 7(a) hereof; or (iii) to assume the defense under paragraph 7(b)
hereof. a determination made by the board of directors under the proceeding sentence shall require only a quorum of one-third of the exact number of directors
of the corporation fixed from time to time in accordance with the certificate of incorporation if such determination is to authorize agent to bring an action under (i)
above, to cause the corporation to participate in a proceeding under (ii) above, and/or to assume a defense of an action against agent under (iii)
above.

                                                    4



subrogation. in the event of payment under this agreement, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of
recovery of agent, who shall execute all documents required and shall do all acts that may be necessary to secure such rights and to enable the corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

non-exclusivity of rights. the rights conferred on agent by this agreement shall not be exclusive of any other right which agent may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or directors, applicable
law or otherwise, both as to action in agent's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.

survival of rights.


the rights conferred on agent by this agreement shall continue after agent has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent of the corporation
or to serve at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or other agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise and shall inure to the benefit of agent's heirs, executors and administrators.

the corporation shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the corporation, expressly to assume and agree to perform this agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the corporation
would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
separability. each of the provisions of this agreement is a separate and distinct agreement and independent of the others, so that if any provision
hereof shall be held to be invalid for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.
furthermore, if this agreement shall be invalidated in its entirety on any ground, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify agent to the fullest extent
provided by the bylaws, the code or any other applicable law.

governing law. this agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware, without regard to choice of
law provisions.

amendment and termination. no amendment, modification, termination or cancellation of this agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed
by both parties hereto.

identical counterparts. this agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall for all purposes be deemed to be an
original but all of which together shall constitute but one and the same agreement. only one such counterpart need be produced to evidence the existence of this
agreement.

headings. the headings of the sections of this agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this
agreement or to affect the construction hereof.
