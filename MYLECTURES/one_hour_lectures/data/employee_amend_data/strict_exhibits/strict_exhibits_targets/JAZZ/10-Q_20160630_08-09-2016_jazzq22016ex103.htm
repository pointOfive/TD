exhibit 10.3[jazz pharmaceuticals letterhead]personal, private and confidential2 may 2016paul treacyre:  amended and restated change in control severance termsdear paul:as was discussed with you, the jazz compensation committee recently approved an updated executive change in control and severance benefit plan (the “change in control plan”) that provides eligibility for severance benefits to certain designated employees in the united states in the event of covered terminations of employment within twelve (12) months following a change in control.  these updates to the change in control plan included, but were not limited to, modifications to the definition of “cause,” broadening the definitions of “good reason” and “change in control” in ways that provide greater protection to participants, and expanding the definition of “covered termination” to include terminations due to disability or death.  the level of severance benefits provided under the change in control plan has remained the same.  because the change in control plan does not apply to non-u.s. employees, your terms and conditions of employment dated 10 june 2014 (the “employment agreement”) was amended previously to provide equivalent cash severance benefits in the event of a covered termination within twelve (12) months following a change in control.  this was accomplished by adding schedule 1 to your employment agreement, which contains the change in control severance terms.  we are now proposing to amend and restate your schedule 1 in order to incorporate the relevant updates from the change in control plan into your change in control severance terms.  as noted above, the level of severance benefits is unchanged.  enclosed is the proposed amended and restated schedule 1 which will entirely replace your current schedule 1.  in all other respects, the remaining terms and conditions set forth in your employment agreement are unaffected and shall continue in effect.to accept the amended and restated schedule 1, please sign and date it in the relevant signature block at the end, and return the fully signed original to me at your earliest convenience and by no later than 13 may 2016.  do not hesitate to let me know if you have any questions.i wish to also take this opportunity to thank you for your valuable contributions to jazz.best regards,/s/ heather p. mcgaughey                                                                        heather mcgaugheysenior vice president, human resourcesencl.:  amended and restated schedule 1 to terms and conditions of employmentamended and restated schedule 1to terms and conditions of employment for paul treacyeffective date:  15 may 20161.covered termination:  the executive will be eligible for the severance benefits (the “severance benefits”) set forth in this amended and restated schedule 1 (the “schedule”) in the event of a covered termination which is effective on or within twelve (12) months following a change in control, subject to the requirements set forth in this schedule.2.severance benefits:   the severance benefits will consist of a cash severance payment and payments for continued health care insurance coverage, as follows:a.cash severance benefits:  a lump sum cash severance payment will be paid to the executive in an amount equal to the sum of the following three components (the “severance payment”):  (1) executive’s final basic salary multiplied by 150%; (2) the product of the final basic salary multiplied by the bonus percentage multiplied by 150%; and (3) the product of the final basic salary multiplied by the bonus percentage multiplied by the bonus multiplier.  notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent applicable, the severance payment shall be reduced by any amounts paid to executive (i) for performance for the calendar year in which the covered termination occurs under any bonus plan maintained by the company or an affiliate (which shall not include any one-time or extraordinary bonus payments provided outside of a plan for performance); (ii) during any period of garden leave immediately preceding the covered termination, (iii) qualifying as pay-in-lieu of notice, or (iv) any other severance benefits whether contractual or statutory (including but not limited to any statutory redundancy pay) or other similar benefits payable to the executive in connection with the executive’s termination of employment.  the severance payment shall be paid to the executive in a single lump sum payment on the sixtieth (60th) day following the date of the covered termination.by way of example, if the effective date of the covered termination is 30 june, executive’s final basic salary is €100,000, and his target bonus is 40% of basic salary (and executive has not received any higher annual bonus (i) in either of the last two calendar years prior to the covered termination, or (ii) in either of the last two calendar years prior to the change in control), the severance payment shall be calculated as follows:(1)    €100,000 x 150% (1.5) = €150,000(2)    €100,000 x bonus percentage (.4) x 150% (1.5) = €60,000(3)    €100,000 x bonus percentage (.4) x 6/12 = €20,000total severance payment:  €150,000 + €60,000 + €20,000 = €230,000b.health continuation coverage benefits:  to the extent that executive elects continued private health insurance coverage following the covered termination at a level equivalent to the private health insurance coverage available to executive during his employment, the employer shall pay the applicable premiums (inclusive of premiums for the executive’s participating dependents, if any) for such plan coverage for a period of eighteen (18) months following the date of the covered termination (or such earlier date if the executive dies, if executive and/or his dependents are no longer eligible for coverage, or if executive obtains new employment which includes eligibility for health plan coverage).  the provision of these benefits is subject to health insurance coverage being obtained on normal terms and subject to medical and other underwriting requirements and other terms and conditions.  the executive shall be required to notify the employer immediately if the executive becomes covered by a health insurance plan of a subsequent employer or if the executive or his participating dependents otherwise cease to be eligible for coverage during the period provided above.  upon the conclusion of such period of insurance premium payments made by the employer, the executive will be responsible for the entire payment of premiums.3.certain definitions:a.“affiliate” means any “parent” or “subsidiary” of the company as such terms are defined in rule 405 of the united states securities act of 1933, as amended.b.“basic salary” means executive’s annual base pay (excluding incentive pay, premium pay, commissions, overtime, bonuses and other forms of variable compensation).c.“board” means the board of directors of the company.d.“bonus multiplier” means the quotient obtained by dividing the number of full months that the executive is employed by the company or an affiliate in the year of a covered termination by twelve (12).e.“bonus percentage” means the greater of (i) the highest amount of any annual bonus paid to the executive by the company or an affiliate for (x) either of the last two (2) calendar years prior to the date of the executive’s covered termination or (y) either of the last two (2) calendar years prior to the change in control, in each case expressed as a percentage of executive’s annual basic salary paid in the applicable year;
