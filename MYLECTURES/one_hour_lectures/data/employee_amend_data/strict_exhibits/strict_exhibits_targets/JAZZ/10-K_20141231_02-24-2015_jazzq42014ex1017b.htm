(2) the product of the severance base multiplied by the bonus percentage (defined below) multiplied by 150%; and (3) the product of the severance base multiplied by the bonus percentage multiplied by the bonus multiplier (defined below).  notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent applicable, the severance payment shall be reduced by any amounts paid to executive (i) during any period of garden leave immediately preceding the covered termination, (ii) qualifying as pay-in-lieu of notice, or (iii) any other severance benefits whether contractual or statutory (including but not limited to any statutory redundancy pay) or other similar benefits payable to the executive in connection with the executive’s termination of employment.  by way of example, if the effective date of the covered termination is 30 june, executive’s annual basic salary in effect as of the covered termination is €100,000, and his target bonus is 40% of basic salary (and executive has not received any higher annual bonus in either of the last two calendar years prior to the covered termination), the severance payment shall be calculated as follows:(1)    €100,000 x 150% (1.5) = €150,000 (2)    €100.000 x bonus percentage (.4) x 150% (1.5) = €60,000 (3)     €100,000 x bonus percentage (.4) x 6/12 = €20,000 total severance payment:  150,000 + 60,000 + 20,000 = €230,000 b.health continuation coverage benefits:  to the extent that executive elects continued private health insurance coverage following the covered termination at a level equivalent to the private health insurance coverage available to executive during his employment, the employer shall pay the applicable premiums (inclusive of premiums for the executive’s participating dependents, if any) for such plan coverage for a period of eighteen (18) months following the date of the covered termination (or such earlier date if the executive dies, if executive and/or his dependents are no longer eligible for coverage, or if executive obtains new employment which includes eligibility for health plan coverage).  the provision of these benefits is subject to health insurance coverage being obtained on normal terms and subject to medical and other underwriting requirements and other terms and conditions.  the executive shall be required to notify the employer immediately if the executive becomes covered by a health insurance plan of a subsequent employer or if the executive or his participating dependents otherwise cease to be eligible for coverage during the period provided above.  upon the conclusion of such period of insurance premium payments made by the employer, the executive will be responsible for the entire payment of premiums.3.certain definitions:a.“affiliate” means any “parent” or “subsidiary” of employer as such terms are defined in rule 405 of the united states securities act of 1933, as amended.b.“bonus percentage” means the greater of (i) any annual bonus, expressed as a percentage of annual base salary paid in the year of determination, paid to the executive by the company or an affiliate in respect of either of the last two calendar years prior to the date of a covered termination or (ii) the executive’s target bonus, expressed as a percentage of annual base salary, for the calendar year in which the covered termination occurs.   c.“bonus multiplier” means the quotient obtained by dividing the number of full months that the executive is employed by the company or an affiliate in the year of a covered termination by twelve (12).d.“change in control” means “change in control” as defined in the jazz pharmaceuticals plc amended and restated executive change in control and severance benefit plan.e.“cause” means the occurrence of any one or more of the following:(i)the executive’s unauthorised use or disclosure of the confidential information or trade secrets of the employer or its affiliates which use or disclosure causes material harm to the employer or an affiliate;
