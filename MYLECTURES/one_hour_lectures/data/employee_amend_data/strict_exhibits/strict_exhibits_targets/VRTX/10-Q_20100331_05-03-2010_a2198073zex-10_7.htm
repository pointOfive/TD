are offered for sale, or any place in the united states or any possessions or

board at the time of such recommendation or election.
 
(i) effective
date shall mean the first date written above.
 
(j) good
reason shall mean that, without the executives consent, one or more of
the following events occurs during the term of this agreement:
 
(i) the executive
is assigned to any material duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent,

(iii) the executives
base salary is decreased;
 
(iv) the principal
executive office of the company, or the executives own office location as assigned

companys successor, in the event of a change of control, to assume all
obligations and liabilities of this agreement; or
 
(vi) the company

provided that good
reason shall not exist unless and until within 30 days after the event giving
rise to good reason under any of (i) through (vi) above has occurred,
the executive delivers a written termination notice to the company stating that
an event giving rise to good reason has occurred and identifying with
reasonable detail the event that the executive asserts constitutes good reason under
any of (i) through (vi) above and the company fails or refuses to
cure or eliminate the event giving rise to good reason on or within 30 days
after receiving such notice.  to avoid
doubt, the termination of the executives employment would become effective at
the close of business on the thirtieth day after the company receives the
executives termination notice, unless the company cures or eliminates the
event giving rise to good reason prior to such time.

share of restricted stock for any period shall mean, for any grant of
restricted stock as to which the companys repurchase right lapses ratably over

continued for such period.  for any other
shares of restricted stock, pro-rata share of restricted stock shall mean, as
to any shares of restricted stock which were granted on the same date and as to
which the companys repurchase right lapses on the same date, that portion of
such shares calculated by multiplying the number of shares by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days that have passed since the date of
grant, plus the number of days in the period in question, and the denominator
of which is the total number of days from the date of the grant until the date
(without regard to any provisions for earlier vesting upon achievement of a specified
goal) on which the companys repurchase right would lapse under the terms of
the grant.
 
(l) severance
pay shall mean an amount equal to the sum of the base salary in effect on
the date of termination of executives employment, plus the amount of the
target bonus for the executive for the year in which the executives employment
is terminated, divided by twelve (12) (each of the 12 shares to constitute a months
severance pay); provided, however, that in the event executive terminates his
employment for good reason based on a reduction in base salary, then the base
salary to be used in calculating severance pay shall be the base salary in
effect immediately prior to such reduction in base salary.
 
(m) subsidiary
shall mean a corporation of which the company owns 50% or more of the combined
voting power of the outstanding securities having the right to vote in an
election of directors, or any other business entity in which the company
directly or indirectly has an ownership interest of 50% or more.
 
(n) target
bonus shall mean a bonus for which the executive is eligible on an annual

26. certain additional
payments by the company.
 
if
any payment or benefit received by executive pursuant to this agreement, but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this
agreement, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of
the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code), or any interest or
penalties are incurred by the executive with respect to such excise tax, the
company will pay to executive an additional amount in cash (the additional
amount) equal to the amount necessary to cause the aggregate payments and
benefits received by executive, including such additional amount (net of all
federal, state, and local income and payroll taxes and all taxes payable as a
result of the application of sections 280g and 4999 of the code and including
any interest and penalties with respect to such taxes) to be equal to the
aggregate payments and benefits executive would have received, excluding such
additional amount (net of all federal, state and local income and payroll
taxes) as if sections 280g and 4999 of the code (and any successor provisions
thereto) had not been enacted into law. 
the company will pay to executive the additional amount within 10 days
after the executive delivers to the company a calculation of the additional
amount, together with such supporting documentation as the company may
reasonably require, provided that the company does not object to such
calculation.
 
if
the company and the executive do not agree on the calculation of the amount of
any such additional amount, executive may submit to the company a written
opinion (the opinion) of a nationally recognized accounting firm, employment
consulting firm, or law firm selected by executive setting forth a statement
and a calculation of the additional amount. the determination of such firm
concerning the extent of the additional amount (which determination need not be
free from doubt), shall be final and binding on both executive and the company.
the company will pay to executive the additional amount not later than ten (10) business
days after such firm has rendered the opinion. the company agrees to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such firm in preparing and rendering the
opinion.
 
if,
following the payment to executive of the additional amount, executives
liability for the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the code on the
payments and benefits received by executive is finally determined (at such time
as the internal revenue service is unable to make any further adjustment to the
amount of such liability) to be less than the amount thereof set forth in the
opinion, the executive shall promptly file for a refund with respect thereof,
and the executive shall promptly pay to the company the amount of such refund
when received (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes
applicable thereto). if, following the payment to executive of the additional
amount, executives liability for the excise tax imposed by section 4999
of the code on the payments and benefits received by executive is finally
determined (at such time as the internal revenue service is unable to 
 





 
make any further
adjustment to the amount of such liability) to be more than the amount thereof
set forth in the opinion and the executive thereafter is required to make a
further payment of any such excise tax, the company shall promptly pay to or
for the benefit of the executive an additional additional amount in respect of
such underpayment.  notwithstanding the
foregoing, no payments under this section 26 from the company to executive
shall be made after the end of the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year in which the executive remits the related taxes to the applicable
taxing authority.
 
27.  409a.
 
any severance payment to the
executive under this agreement shall be bifurcated into two portions,
consisting of a portion that does not constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation within the meaning of section 409a of the code and a
portion, if any, that does constitute nonqualified deferred compensation. if
the executive is a specified employee as defined in section 409a(a)(2)(b)(i) of
the code, the commencement of the delivery of any such payments that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation payable upon a separation from service
under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of the code will be delayed until the
later of (i) the first business day that is more than six months after the
employment termination date and (ii) the date such payments would
otherwise be payable hereunder. the determination of whether, and the extent to
which, any of the payments to be made to the executive hereunder are nonqualified
deferred compensation shall be made after the application of all applicable
exclusions, including those set forth under treasury reg. § 1.409a-1(b)(9). any
payments that are intended to qualify for the exclusion for separation pay due
to involuntary separation from service set forth in reg. §1.409a-1(b)(9)(iii) must
be paid no later than the last day of the second taxable year following the
taxable year in which the employment termination date occurs.  to the extent that the termination of the
executives employment does not constitute a separation of service under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of
the code (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to
be provided by the executive to the company at the time the executives
employment is terminated), the payment of any non-qualified deferred
compensation will be further delayed until the later of (i) date the first
business day that is more than six months after the date of a subsequent event
constituting a separation of service under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of
the code and (ii) the date such payments would otherwise be payable
hereunder.  any portion of a payment that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under section 409a of the
code payable as a result of a termination of employment may only be paid upon a
separation from service under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of the
code.  for purposes of clarification, the
foregoing sentence shall not cause any forfeiture of benefits on the part of
the executive, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a separation
from service occurs.
 
in
witness whereof, the undersigned have executed this agreement as of the date
first written above.
