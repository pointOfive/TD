executive from time to time by the chief executive officer of the company. executive shall devote his best efforts and full business time to the business and interests of the company. during the term of executives employment with the company,
executive may serve on the board of directors of other companies, manage personal investments, and engage in civic and charitable activities, provided that such activities shall not represent a conflict of interest with the company and do not
materially detract from fulfilling executives responsibilities and duties to the company.

executives employment at the rate determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors (the compensation committee), or as applicable, any individual authorized to approve the terms of employment of executive.
executives base salary shall be reviewed annually and evaluated based on performance and salary levels of other executives of comparable position within the industry and geographic location of the company. based upon such evaluation and

2.2 bonus. in addition to base salary, executive may be eligible to receive an annual bonus (annual bonus), based on
a target percentage of executives base salary determined by the compensation committee, or as applicable any individual authorized to approve the terms of employment of executive. the amount of the annual bonus shall be based upon performance
criteria and financial and operational results of the company as determined by the compensation committee, or as applicable, any individual authorized to approve the terms of employment of executive. to the extent that the annual bonus is earned and
becomes payable in accordance with the terms under which it is offered and unless otherwise specified in a written document reflecting the bonus arrangement, any annual bonus earned by executive will be paid to executive prior to two and one half (2
 1⁄2) months following the year in which the annual bonus becomes payable as a result of executives vesting in the right to the annual bonus. 
2.3 equity awards. executive may be eligible to receive grants of stock options or other equity awards from time to time in the

(i) the companys determination in good faith that it is terminating executive for cause (as defined in section 3.3 below)
(termination for cause);  (ii) the companys determination that it is terminating executive without cause, which
determination may be made by the company at any time at the companys sole discretion, for any or no reason (termination without cause); 
(iii) the effective date of a written notice sent to the company from executive stating that executive is electing to terminate his
employment with the company (voluntary termination);  (iv) a change in executives status such that a
constructive termination (as defined in section 3.2(d) below) has occurred; or  (v) following executives death or
disability (as defined in section 3.4 below).  3.2 severance benefits. executive shall be entitled
to receive severance benefits upon termination of employment only as set forth in this section 3.2 contingent upon resignation from all positions held by executive and only if executive executes a full release and waiver of claims within thirty
(30) days of executives termination (and allows it to become effective in accordance with its terms):  (a) voluntary
termination. if executives employment terminates by voluntary termination, then executive shall not be entitled to receive payment of any severance benefits. executive will receive payment(s) for all salary and unpaid vacation
accrued as of the date of executives termination of employment and executives benefits will be continued under the companys then existing benefit plans and policies in accordance with such plans and policies in effect on the date
of termination and in accordance with applicable law.  (b) involuntary termination. if executives employment is
terminated under section 3.1(a)(ii) (termination without cause) or 3.1(a)(iv) (constructive termination) above (such termination, an involuntary termination), executive will be entitled to receive payment of severance
benefits equal to executives regular monthly salary for twelve (12) months (the severance period). such payments shall be made, at the companys option, in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the date of
executives involuntary termination or periodically over the severance period according to the companys standard payroll schedule, provided that such payments may not extend beyond two and one-half (2

the date of involuntary termination of the pro rata portion of any 
  -3- 



annual bonus based on achievement of the specific corporate and individual performance targets established for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, payable prior to two and one-half

receive payment of any severance benefits. executive will receive payment(s) for all salary and unpaid vacation accrued as of the date of executives termination of employment and executives benefits will be continued under the
companys then existing benefit plans and policies in accordance with such plans and policies in effect on the date of termination and in accordance with applicable law. 
(d) constructive termination. constructive termination shall be deemed to occur if (a) there is a
material reduction or change in job duties, responsibilities and requirements inconsistent with executives position with the company and prior duties, responsibilities and requirements, provided that neither a mere change in title alone nor
reassignment to a position that is substantially similar to the position held prior to the change in terms of job duties, responsibilities or requirements shall constitute a material reduction in job responsibilities; or (b) there is a
reduction in executives then-current base salary by at least twenty percent (20%), provided that an across-the-board reduction in the salary level of all other senior executives by the same percentage amount as part of a general salary level
reduction shall not constitute such a salary reduction; or (c) executive refuses to relocate to a facility or location more than 50 miles from the companys current location; provided, however, that in each case above, executive must first
provide notice of the existence of the circumstances giving rise to a constructive termination within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such circumstances and the company must be provided with a period of thirty (30) days from
the date of receipt of such notice to cure the circumstances giving rise to a constructive termination; provided further that the company may notify executive at any time prior to expiration of the cure period that it will not cure the
circumstances, in which case the cure period shall end immediately upon such notification.  (e) termination by reason of death or
disability. in the event that executives employment with the company terminates as a result of executives death or disability (as defined in section 3.4 below), executive or executives estate or
representative will receive all salary and unpaid vacation accrued as of the date of executives death or disability and any other benefits payable under the companys then existing benefit plans and policies in accordance with such plans
and policies in effect on the date of death or disability and in accordance with applicable law. in addition, executives estate or representative will receive the amount of executives annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the death
or disability occurs to the extent that the annual bonus has been earned as of the date of executives death or disability, as determined by the board of directors or its compensation committee based on the specific corporate and individual
performance targets established for such fiscal year, which will be paid prior to two and one-half (2  1⁄2) months following the year of executives death
or disability (subject to executives termination as a result of such disability). 
  -4- 


3.3 definition of cause. for purposes of this agreement,
cause for executives termination will exist at any time after the happening of one or more of the following events: 
(a) an action or omission of executive which constitutes a willful and intentional material breach of this agreement or the confidentiality
agreement (defined below), including without limitation, executives theft or other misappropriation of the companys proprietary information; 
(b) executives commitment of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds or breach of trust in connection with executives
employment; or  (c) executives conviction of any crime which involves dishonesty or a breach of trust, or gross negligence in
connection with the performance of the executives duties.  3.4. definition of disability. for purposes
of this agreement disability shall mean any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve
(12) months and renders executive unable to perform the duties of chief medical officer and executive vice president, research and development. 
iv. stock acceleration  4.1
accelerated vesting. unless specifically provided otherwise in the applicable equity award agreement, in addition to any other right of acceleration that may be provided pursuant to any equity award plan or agreement pursuant to which
executive has been granted an equity award by the company, if executives employment is terminated due to an involuntary termination, the vesting of any equity awards granted by the company to executive shall accelerate such that such equity
awards shall become vested as to an additional twelve (12) months, effective as of the date of such involuntary termination, to the extent that such equity awards are outstanding and unvested as of the date of such involuntary termination;
provided that if such involuntary termination occurs within twelve (12) months after a change of control (as defined below), then the vesting of all such equity awards shall be accelerated completely so that such equity awards shall
become fully vested, effective as of the date of such involuntary termination, to the extent that such equity awards are outstanding and unvested as of the date of such involuntary termination. for the avoidance of any doubt, this section shall
prevail over any provision in an equity award agreement providing that unvested equity awards shall terminate or be forfeited as of the date of such termination, and any such provision shall be inoperative to the extent it is in conflict with this
section.  4.2 definition of change of control. for purposes of this agreement, change of control shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) an acquisition of the company by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger or consolidation but
excluding any 
  -5- 



merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the domicile of the company), or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company (collectively, a
merger), so long as in either case the companys stockholders of record immediately prior to such merger will, immediately after such merger, hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving or
acquiring entity.  v. restrictive covenants 
5.1 confidentiality agreement. executive shall sign, or has signed the companys form of proprietary
information and inventions agreement (the confidentiality agreement). executive hereby represents and warrants to the company that he has complied with all obligations under the confidentiality agreement and agrees to continue to
abide by the terms of the confidentiality agreement and further agrees that the provisions of the confidentiality agreement shall survive any termination of this agreement or of executives employment relationship with the company, including
the noncompetition provisions of the confidentiality agreement.  vi. other provisions 
6.1 limitation on severance benefits. in the event that any severance benefits provided for in this agreement to
executive (i) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of section 280g of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code) and (ii) but for this section 6.1, would be subject to the
excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the code, then executives severance benefits under section 3.2 shall be payable either: 
(a) in full, or  (b) as to such
lesser amount which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to excise tax under section 4999 of the code,  whichever of the
foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by section 4999, results in the receipt by executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits under
section 3.2 notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under section 4999 of the code. any determination required under this section 6.1 shall be made in writing by independent public accountants
appointed by executive and reasonably acceptable to the company (the accountants), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon executive and the company for all purposes. for purposes of making the calculations
required by this section 6.1, the accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of sections 280g and 4999 of the
code. the company and executive shall furnish to the accountants such information and documents as the accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this section 6.1. the company shall bear all costs the accountants
may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this section 6.1. if a reduced amount is to be paid under this section 6.1, reductions in payments and/or benefits shall occur in the following order:
(1) reduction of cash payments, (2) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards other than stock options, (3) cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock options and (4) reduction of other benefits (if any) paid to the
executive. 
  -6- 


6.2 code section 409a. this agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any
penalty sanctions under section 409a of the code and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder (section 409a). if any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without
incurring sanctions under section 409a, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this
agreement may be made only upon a separation of service under section 409a. notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, if at the time of executives termination of employment, executive is a specified
employee within the meaning of section 409a, and the deferral of the commencement of any severance payments or benefits otherwise payable pursuant to this agreement as a result of such termination of employment is necessary in order to
prevent any accelerated income recognition or additional tax under section 409a(a)(1), then the company will not commence any payment of any such severance payments or benefits otherwise required hereunder (but without any reduction in such
payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to executive) that (a) will not and may not under any circumstances, regardless of when such termination occurs, be paid in full by march 15 of the year following executives
termination (or two and one half (2  1⁄2) months after the close of the companys fiscal year, if later), and (b) are in excess of the lesser of
(i) two (2) times executives then annual compensation or (ii) two (2) times the limit on compensation set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the code for the year in which executives employment is terminated and will
not be paid by the end of the second calendar year following the year in which the termination occurs, until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following executives separation of service
with the company (as defined under code section 409a). if any payments are delayed due to such requirements, such amounts will be paid in a lump sum to executive on the earliest of (x) executives death following the date of
executives termination of employment with the company or (y) the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six (6) months following executives separation of service with the company. for these purposes,
each severance payment or benefit is designated as a separate payment or benefit and will not collectively be treated as a single payment or benefit. this provision is intended to comply with the requirements of code section 409a so that none
of the severance payments and benefits to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under section 409a, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. the company and executive agree to work together in
good faith to consider amendments to this agreement and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to executive under
section 409a. notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this agreement, to the extent that any amendment to this agreement with respect to the payment of any severance payments or benefits would constitute under section 409a a
delay or acceleration in a payment or a change in the form of payment, then such amendment must be done in a manner that complies with section 409a(a)(4)(c).

6.3 indemnification. the company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the executive
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law and as set forth in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the company, from and against any expenses, including legal fees, and all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
and reasonably incurred in connection with legal, administrative or investigative proceedings to which the executive is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of the fact the executive is or was a director or officer of the company. 
 6.4 entire agreement. this agreement, the confidentiality agreement, the indemnification agreement between executive
and the company and any agreement pertaining to executives equity awards contain the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to executives employment by the company and compensation payable to executive by the
company and supersede all prior understandings, agreements and discussions, including the prior agreement. this agreement may only be amended or modified by a written instrument executed by executive and the company pursuant to authorization by any
individual or individuals authorized to approve the compensation and other terms of employment of executive.  6.5 notices.
any and all notices permitted or required to be given under this agreement must be in writing. notices will be deemed given (i) on the first business day after having been sent by commercial overnight courier with written verification of
