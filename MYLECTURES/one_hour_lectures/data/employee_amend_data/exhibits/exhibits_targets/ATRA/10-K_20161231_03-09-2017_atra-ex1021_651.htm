8.2.2health care continuation coverage payments.  
(i)cobra premiums. if executive timely elects continued coverage under cobra, the company will pay executive’s cobra premiums to continue executive’s coverage (including coverage for executive’s eligible dependents, if applicable) (“cobra premiums”) through the period starting on the termination date and ending nine (9) months after the termination date (the “cobra premium period”); provided, however, that the company’s provision of such cobra premium benefits will immediately cease if during the cobra premium period executive becomes eligible for group health insurance coverage through a new employer or executive ceases to be eligible for cobra continuation coverage for any reason, including plan termination.  in the event executive becomes covered under another employer’s group health plan or otherwise ceases to be eligible for cobra during the cobra premium period, executive must immediately notify the company of such event.

4.

 
(a) in no event will executive be entitled to severance benefits under section 8.2 and this section 8.3, and (b) if the company has commenced providing severance benefits to executive under section 8.2 prior to the date that executive becomes eligible to receive cic severance benefits under this section 8.3, the severance benefits previously provided to executive under section 8.2 of this agreement shall reduce the cic severance benefits provided under this section 8.3:
8.3.1cic severance payment.  severance pay in the form of a lump sum payment of executive’s final base salary for the year in which the termination date occurs, payable within sixty (60) days following the termination date and subject to required payroll deductions and tax withholdings (the “cic severance payment”); provided, however that, if the period for satisfaction of the release requirement (as defined below) begins in one taxable year and ends in another taxable year, payment shall not be made until the beginning of the second taxable year.  for such purposes, executive’s final base salary will be calculated prior to giving effect to any reduction in base salary that would give rise to executive’s right to resign for good reason.
8.3.2cic health care continuation coverage payments.
(i)cobra premiums. if executive timely elects continued coverage under cobra, the company will pay executive’s cobra premiums to continue executive’s coverage (including coverage for executive’s eligible dependents, if applicable) (“cic cobra premiums”) through the period starting on the termination date and ending twelve (12) months after the termination date (the “cic cobra premium period”); provided, however, that the company’s provision of such cic cobra premium benefits will immediately cease if during the cic cobra premium period executive becomes eligible for group health insurance coverage through a new employer or executive ceases to be eligible for cobra continuation coverage for any reason, including plan termination.  in the event executive becomes covered under another employer’s group health plan or otherwise ceases to be eligible for cobra during the cic cobra premium period, executive must immediately notify the company of such event.
(ii)special cash payments in lieu of cic cobra premiums.  notwithstanding the foregoing, if the company determines, in its sole discretion, that it cannot pay the cic cobra premiums without potentially incurring financial costs or penalties under applicable law  (including, without limitation, section 2716 of the public health service act), regardless of whether executive or executive’s dependents elect or are eligible for cobra coverage, the company instead shall pay to executive, on the first day of each calendar month following the termination date, a fully taxable cash payment equal to the applicable cobra premiums for that month (including the amount of cobra premiums for executive’s eligible dependents), subject to applicable tax withholdings (such amount, the “special cic cash payment”), for the remainder of the cic cobra premium period.  executive may, but is not obligated to, use such special cic cash payments toward the cost of cobra premiums.
8.3.3target bonus amount.  executive shall also receive an amount equal to the target bonus amount, payable in a lump sum within sixty (60) days following the termination date and subject to required payroll deductions and tax withholdings; provided, 
5.

 
however that, if the period for satisfaction of the release requirement (as defined below) begins in one taxable year and ends in another taxable year, payment shall not be made until the beginning of the second taxable year.  for purposes of calculating the target bonus amount, executive’s final base salary will be calculated prior to giving effect to any reduction in base salary that would give rise to executive’s right to resign for good reason.
8.3.4equity acceleration.  notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the company’s 2014 equity incentive plan, any prior equity incentive plans or any award agreement, effective as of executive’s employment termination date, the vesting and exercisability of all unvested time-based vesting equity awards then held by executive shall accelerate such that all shares become immediately vested and exercisable, if applicable, by executive upon such termination and shall remain exercisable, if applicable, following executive’s termination as set forth in the applicable equity award documents.  with respect to any performance-based vesting equity award, such award shall continue to be governed in all respects by the terms of the applicable equity award documents.
8.4termination for cause; resignation without good reason; death or disability.  executive will not be eligible for, or entitled to any severance benefits, including (without limitation) the severance benefits and change in control benefits listed in sections 8.2 and 8.3 above, if the company terminates executive’s employment for cause, executive resigns executive’s employment without good reason, or executive’s employment terminates due to executive’s death or disability.  
9.conditions to receipt of severance benefits and change in control severance benefits.  to be eligible for any of the severance benefits or change in control severance benefits pursuant to sections 8.2 and 8.3 above, executive must satisfy the following release requirement (the “release requirement”): return to the company a signed and dated general release of all known and unknown claims in a termination agreement acceptable to the company (the “release”) within the applicable deadline set forth therein, but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following executive’s termination date, and permit the release to become effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms (such effective date of the release, the “effective date”).  no severance benefits or change in control severance benefits will be paid hereunder prior to the effective date of the release.  accordingly, if executive breaches the preceding sentence and/or refuses to sign and deliver to the company an executed release or signs and delivers to the company the release but exercises executive’s right, if any, under applicable law to revoke the release (or any portion thereof), then executive will not be entitled to any severance, payment or benefit under this agreement.
10.section 409a.  it is intended that all of the severance benefits and other payments payable under this agreement satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of code section 409a provided under treasury regulations 1.409a‑1(b)(4), 1.409a‑1(b)(5) and 1.409a‑1(b)(9), and this agreement will be construed to the greatest extent possible as consistent with those provisions, and to the extent no so exempt, this agreement (and any definitions hereunder) will be construed in a manner that complies with section 409a.  for purposes of code section 409a (including, without limitation, for purposes of treasury regulation section 1.409a‑2(b)(2)(iii)), executive’s right to receive any installment payments under this agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated 
6.

 
as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.  notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this agreement, if executive is deemed by the company at the time of executive’s separation from service to be a “specified employee” for purposes of code section 409a(a)(2)(b)(i), and if any of the payments upon separation from service set forth herein and/or under any other agreement with the company are deemed to be “deferred compensation”, then to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of such payments is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under code section 409a(a)(2)(b)(i) and the related adverse taxation under section 409a, such payments shall not be provided to executive prior to the earliest of (i) the expiration of the six-month and one day period measured from the date of executive’s separation from service with the company, (ii) the date of executive’s death or (iii) such earlier date as permitted under section 409a without the imposition of adverse taxation.  upon the first business day following the expiration of such applicable code section 409a(a)(2)(b)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid in a lump sum to executive, and any remaining payments due shall be paid as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable agreement. no interest shall be due on any amounts so deferred.  if the company determines that any severance benefits provided under this agreement constitutes “deferred compensation” under section 409a, for purposes of determining the schedule for payment of the severance benefits, the effective date of the release will not be deemed to have occurred any earlier than the sixtieth (60th) date following the separation from service, regardless of when the release actually becomes effective.  in addition to the above, to the extent required to comply with section 409a and the applicable regulations and guidance issued thereunder, if the applicable deadline for executive to execute (and not revoke) the applicable release spans two calendar years, payment of the applicable severance benefits shall not commence until the beginning of the second calendar year.  to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under code section 409a, amounts reimbursable to executive under this agreement shall be paid to executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to executive) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.  the company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this agreement will be exempt from or comply with code section 409a and makes no undertaking to preclude code section 409a from applying to any such payment.
11.section 280g; limitations on payment.
11.1if any payment or benefit executive will or may receive from the company or otherwise (a “280g payment”) would (i) constitute a “parachute payment” within the meaning of section 280g of the code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the code (the “excise tax”), then any such 280g payment provided pursuant to this agreement (a “payment”) shall be equal to the reduced amount.  the “reduced amount” shall be either (x) the largest portion of the payment that would result in no portion of the payment (after reduction) being subject to the excise tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the payment, whichever amount (i.e., the amount determined by clause (x) or by clause (y)), after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the excise tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in executive’s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the payment may be subject to the excise tax.  if a reduction in a payment is 
7.

 
required pursuant to the preceding sentence and the reduced amount is determined pursuant to clause (x) of the preceding sentence, the reduction shall occur in the manner (the “reduction method”) that results in the greatest economic benefit for executive.  if more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata (the “pro rata reduction method”).
11.2notwithstanding any provision of section 11.1 to the contrary, if the reduction method or the pro rata reduction method would result in any portion of the payment being subject to taxes pursuant to section 409a that would not otherwise be subject to taxes pursuant to section 409a, then the reduction method and/or the pro rata reduction method, as the case may be, shall be modified so as to avoid the imposition of taxes pursuant to section 409a as follows:  (a) as a first priority, the modification shall preserve to the greatest extent possible, the greatest economic benefit for executive as determined on an after-tax basis; (b) as a second priority, payments that are contingent on future events (e.g., being terminated without cause), shall be reduced (or eliminated) before payments that are not contingent on future events; and (c) as a third priority, payments that are “deferred compensation” within the meaning of section 409a shall be reduced (or eliminated) before payments that are not deferred compensation within the meaning of section 409a.
11.3unless executive and the company agree on an alternative accounting firm or law firm, the accounting firm engaged by the company for general tax compliance purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the change in control transaction shall perform the foregoing calculations.  if the accounting firm so engaged by the company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control transaction, the company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting or law firm to make the determinations required by this section 11.  the company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting or law firm required to be made hereunder.  the company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the accounting or law firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder to provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to executive and the company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which executive’s right to a 280g payment becomes reasonably likely to occur (if requested at that time by executive or the company) or such other time as requested by executive or the company.
11.4if executive receives a payment for which the reduced amount was determined pursuant to clause (x) of section 11.1 and the internal revenue service determines thereafter that some portion of the payment is subject to the excise tax, executive agrees to promptly return to the company a sufficient amount of the payment (after reduction pursuant to clause (x) of section 11.1) so that no portion of the remaining payment is subject to the excise tax.  for the avoidance of doubt, if the reduced amount was determined pursuant to clause (y) of section 9.1, executive shall have no obligation to return any portion of the payment pursuant to the preceding sentence.
12.definitions.
12.1cause.  for the purposes of this agreement, “cause” means the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (i) executive’s conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo
