effective
date shall mean february 11, 2008.
 
good
reason shall mean that, without the executives consent, one or more of
the following events occurs:
 





 
(i)          the executive is
assigned to any duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent, in any
significant respect, with the scope of duties and responsibilities customarily
associated with the position and office of senior vice president, public policy
and government affairs, provided that such reassignment of duties or
responsibilities is not due to the executives disability or performance, nor
is at the executives request; or
 
(ii)         the executive suffers a
reduction in the authorities, duties, and responsibilities associated with the
executives position as senior vice president, public policy and government
affairs, provided that such reassignment of duties or responsibilities is not
due to the executives disability or the executives performance, and is not at
the executives request or with the executives 
prior agreement; or
 
(iii)        the executives base salary is
decreased below $350,000 per year, other than a reduction that is part of an

has occurred, the executive delivers a written termination notice to the
company stating that an event giving rise to good reason has occurred and

constitutes good reason under any of (i) through (iv) above and the
company fails or refuses to cure or eliminate the event giving rise to good
reason on or within 30 days after receiving such notice.  to avoid doubt, the termination of the
executives employment would become effective at the close of business on the
thirtieth day after the company receives the executives termination notice,
unless the company cures or eliminates the event giving rise to good reason
prior to such time.
 
pro-rata
share of restricted stock shall mean, for any grant of restricted stock as
to which the companys repurchase right lapses ratably over a specified period
(e.g. in equal annual increments over four years), that number of shares as to
which the companys repurchase right with respect to those shares would have
lapsed if the executives employment by the company had continued for an
additional 18 months.  for any other
shares of restricted stock, pro-rata share of restricted stock shall mean, as
to any shares of restricted stock which were granted on the same date and as to
which the companys repurchase right lapses on the same date, that portion of
such shares calculated by multiplying the number of shares by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days that have passed since the date of
grant (until the employment termination date), plus the number of days in the
18 months after the employment termination date, and the denominator of which
is the total number of days from the date of the grant until the date (without
regard to any provisions for earlier vesting upon achievement of a specified
goal) on which the companys repurchase right would lapse under the terms of
the grant.
 
severance
payment shall mean an amount equal to the sum of the base salary in effect
on the date of termination of executives employment, plus the amount of the
target bonus for the executive for the
year in which the executives employment is terminated; provided, however, that
if the executive terminates the executives employment for good reason based on
a reduction in base salary, then the base salary to be used in calculating
the severance payment shall be the base salary in effect immediately prior to
such reduction in base salary.
 
target
bonus shall mean the target cash bonus for which the executive is eligible
on an annual basis, at a level consistent with the executives title and
responsibilities, under the companys bonus program then in effect and
applicable to the companys senior executives generally.

the deferred payment date.  payments

shall continue according to the applicable payment schedule.  to the extent that the termination of the
executives employment does not constitute a separation of service under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of
the code (as the result of further services that reasonably are anticipated to
be provided by the executive to the company at the time the executives
employment is terminated), the payment of any nonqualified deferred
compensation will be further delayed until the date that is the first full
business day that is more than 6 months after the date of a subsequent event
constituting a separation of service under section 409a(a)(2)(a)(i) of
