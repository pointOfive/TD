 recitals  whereas, the company and the executive are parties to the employment agreement, and the company and the executive now desire to amend the employment agreement to include a bonus component to the severance
amounts for which the executive is eligible under the employment agreement and to clarify certain payment timing provisions set forth therein.  whereas, section 13 of the employment agreement permits modifications to the employment agreement by written agreement between the company and the executive.

termination of employment occurs. the severance amount shall be paid in equal monthly installments over the twelve-month period following executives termination of employment (the severance period). such monthly payments shall
commence within 60 days after the effective date of the termination, subject to executives execution and non-revocation of the release during such 60 day period. notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the timing of executives execution of the release, directly or indirectly, result in executive designating the calendar year of payment, and if a payment that is subject to execution of the release could be made in more than one taxable
year, payment shall be made in the later taxable year.  2. section 2.2(b)(ii) of the employment agreement is amended to
read as follows:  (i) executive shall receive severance payments in an amount equal to (a) 1.5 times
executives annual base salary at the rate in effect at the time of executives termination plus (b) 1.5 times the executives average annual bonus paid by the company to executive for the two fiscal years preceding the fiscal
