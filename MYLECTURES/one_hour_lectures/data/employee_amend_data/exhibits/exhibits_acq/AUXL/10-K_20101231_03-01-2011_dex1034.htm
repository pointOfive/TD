that certain employment agreement dated october 25, 2010 (the prior agreement); and  whereas, the company and
executive now desire to amend and restate the prior agreement to make changes to the health benefit severance amounts payable under the prior agreement and to make certain other changes set forth herein.

perform executives duties and responsibilities, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions hereinafter set forth. this agreement is effective as of december 23, 2010 (the effective date) and shall continue until
the third anniversary thereof, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of this agreement (the initial term). in addition, this agreement shall automatically renew for periods of one (1) year unless either party gives written
notice to the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the initial term or any one (1) year renewal period, as applicable, that the agreement shall not be further extended. nothing in this agreement shall be construed as
giving executive any right to be retained in the employ of the company, and executive specifically acknowledges that executive shall be an employee-at-will of the company, and thus subject to discharge at any time by the company with or without

company.

the release. notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the timing of executives execution of the release, directly or indirectly, result in executive designating the calendar year of payment, and

heirs or assigns or any other person claiming under or through executive.  2.6 cause. the company may terminate
executives employment at any time for cause (as defined in section 2.8) upon written notice to executive, in which event all payments under this agreement shall cease. executive shall be entitled to any compensation any amounts earned,

2.8 definitions.  (a) cause shall mean any of the following grounds for termination of executives employment:  (i) executive shall have been convicted of, or entered a plea of guilty to, a felony, 
  6 


(ii) executive intentionally and continually fails to perform executives reasonably
assigned material duties to the company (other than a failure resulting from executives incapacity due to physical or mental illness), which failure has continued for a period of at least 30 days after a written notice of demand for
substantial performance, signed by a duly authorized officer of the company, has been delivered to executive specifying the manner in which executive has failed substantially to perform, 
(iii) executive engages in willful misconduct in the performance of executives duties, or 
(iv) executive materially breaches section 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 below. 
(b) change of control as used herein, a change of control shall be deemed to have occurred if: 
(i) any person (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the
exchange act)) becomes a beneficial owner (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the exchange act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the company representing more than 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
securities of the company; provided that a change of control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of a transaction in which the company becomes a subsidiary of another corporation and in which the stockholders of the company, immediately prior
to the transaction, will beneficially own, immediately after the transaction, shares entitling such stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of the parent corporation would be entitled in the election of directors; or
 (ii) the consummation of (a) a merger or consolidation of the company with another corporation where the stockholders
of the company, immediately prior to the merger or consolidation, will not beneficially own, immediately after the merger or consolidation, shares entitling such stockholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all stockholders of the surviving
corporation would be entitled in the election of directors or (b) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company.  (iii) after the effective date, directors are elected such that a majority of the members of the board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by
a majority of the members of the board prior to the date of the appointment or election.  (c) good reason
shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions, unless executive has expressly consented in writing thereto, or except as a result of executives physical or mental incapacity or as described in the last sentence of this
subsection (c):  (i) a material reduction in executives base salary;

  7 


(iii) the company requires that executives principal office location be moved to a
location more than 50 miles from executives principal office location immediately before the change.  notwithstanding the foregoing,
executive shall not have good reason for termination unless (a) executive gives written notice of termination for good reason within 30 days after the event giving rise to good reason occurs, (b) the company does not correct the action or
failure to act that constitutes the grounds for good reason, as set forth in executives notice of termination, within 30 days after the date on which executive gives written notice of termination and (c) executive actually resigns within
30 days following the expiration of the cure period.  2.9 section 409a. 
(a) this agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under section 409a of the code. if any payment or benefit cannot
be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under section 409a of the code, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full (to extent not paid in part at earlier date) at the earliest time thereafter when
such sanctions will not be imposed. for purposes of section 409a of the code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this agreement may only be made upon executives separation from service (within the
meaning of such term under section 409a of the code), each payment made under this agreement shall be treated as a separate payment, and the right to a series of installment payments under this agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of
separate payments. in no event shall executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment, except as permitted under section 409a of the code.  (b) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if, at the time of executives termination of employment with the company, the company has securities which are publicly traded on an established
securities market and executive is a specified employee (as such term is defined in section 409a of the code) and it is necessary to postpone the commencement of any payments or benefits otherwise payable under this agreement as a result
of such termination of employment to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under section 409a of the code, then the company will postpone the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any reduction in such
payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to executive) that are not otherwise paid within the short-term deferral exception under treas. reg. §1.409a-1(b)(4), and the separation pay exception under treas. reg.
§1.409a-1(b)(9)(iii), until the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six months following executives separation of service (as such term is defined under code section 409a of the code) with the company. if any
payments are postponed due to such requirements, such postponed amounts will be paid in a lump sum to executive on the first payroll date that occurs after the date that is six months following executives separation of service with the
company. if executive dies during the postponement period prior to the payment of postponed amount, the amounts postponed on account of section 409a of the code shall be paid to the personal representative of executives estate within 60 days
after the date of executives death.  (c) all reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this agreement shall be
made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409a of the code, 
  8 



including, where applicable, the requirement that (a) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during executives lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this
agreement), (b) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year,
(c) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred and (d) the right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to
liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  3. non-exclusivity of rights. nothing in this agreement shall prevent or limit
executives continuing or future participation in or rights under any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by the company and for which executive may qualify; provided, however, that if executive becomes entitled to and
receives the payments provided for in section 2 of this agreement, executive hereby waives executives right to receive payments under any severance plan or similar program applicable to all employees of the company. 
4. confidentiality. executive agrees that executives services to the company and its subsidiaries and any successors or assigns
(collectively, the employer) were and are of a special, unique and extraordinary character, and that executives position places executive in a position of confidence and trust with the employers customers and employees.
executive also recognizes that executives position with the employer will give executive substantial access to confidential information (as defined below), the disclosure of which to competitors of the employer would cause the employer to
suffer substantial and irreparable damage. executive recognizes, therefore, that it is in the employers legitimate business interest to restrict executives use of confidential information for any purposes other than the discharge of
executives employment duties at the employer, and to limit any potential appropriation of confidential information by executive for the benefit of the employers competitors and to the detriment of the employer. accordingly, executive
agrees as follows:  (a) executive will not at any time, whether during or after the termination of executives
employment, reveal to any person or entity any of the trade secrets or confidential information of the employer or of any third party which the employer is under an obligation to keep confidential (including but not limited to trade secrets or
confidential information respecting inventions, products, designs, methods, know-how, techniques, systems, processes, software programs, works of authorship, customer lists, projects, plans and proposals) (confidential information),
except as may be required in the ordinary course of performing executives duties as an employee of the employer, and executive shall keep secret all matters entrusted to executive and shall not use or attempt to use any such information in any
manner which may injure or cause loss or may be calculated to injure or cause loss whether directly or indirectly to the employer.  (b) the above restrictions shall not apply to: (i) information that at the time of disclosure is in the public domain through no fault of executive; (ii) information received from a third party
outside of the employer that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iii) information approved for release by written authorization of the employer; or (iv) information that may be required by law or an order of
any court, agency or proceeding to be disclosed; provided executive shall provide the employer notice of any such required disclosure once executive has knowledge of it and will help the employer to the extent reasonable to obtain an appropriate
protective order. 
  9 


(c) further, executive agrees that during executives employment executive shall not
take, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the
employer or concerning any of its dealings or affairs otherwise than for the benefit of the employer. executive further agrees that executive shall not, after the termination of executives employment, use or permit to be used any such notes,
memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials, it being agreed that all of the foregoing shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the employer and
that, immediately upon the termination of executives employment, executive shall deliver all of the foregoing, and all copies thereof, to the employer, at its main office. 
(d) executive agrees that upon the termination of executives employment with the employer, executive will not take or retain
without written authorization any documents, files or other property of the employer, and executive will return promptly to the employer any such documents, files or property in executives possession or custody, including any copies thereof
maintained in any medium or format. executive recognizes that all documents, files and property which executive has received and will receive from the employer, including but not limited to scientific research, customer lists, handbooks, memoranda,
product specifications, and other materials (with the exception of documents relating to benefits to which executive might be entitled following the termination of executives employment with the employer), are for the exclusive use of the
employer and employees who are discharging their responsibilities on behalf of the employer, and that executive has no claim or right to the continued use, possession or custody of such documents, files or property following the termination of
executives employment with the employer.  5. intellectual property. 
(a) if at any time or times during executives employment executive shall (either alone or with others) make, conceive, discover or
reduce to practice any invention, modification, discovery, design, development, improvement, process, software program, work of authorship, documentation, formula, data, technique, know-how, secret or intellectual property right whatsoever or any
interest therein (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes or subject to analogous protection) (herein called developments) that (i) relates to the business of the employer or any customer of or
supplier to the employer or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured or sold by the employer or which may be used in relation therewith, (ii) results from tasks assigned to executive by the employer or (iii) results
from the use of premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the employer, such developments and the benefits thereof shall immediately become the sole and absolute property of the employer and
its assigns, and executive shall promptly disclose to the employer (or any persons designated by it) each such development, and executive hereby assigns any rights executive may have or acquire in the developments and benefits and/or rights
resulting therefrom to the employer and its assigns without further compensation and shall communicate, without cost or delay, and without publishing the same, all available information relating thereto (with all necessary plans and models) to the
employer. 
  10 


(b) upon disclosure of each development to the employer, executive will, during
executives employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the employer, sign, execute, make and do all such deeds, documents, acts and things as the employer and its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: 
(i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the employer alone (unless the employer otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights
or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and  (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous
protection.  (c) in the event the employer is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure executives signature on any
letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to a development, whether because of executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the
employer and its duly authorized officers and agents as executives agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on executives behalf and stead to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letter patents, copyright and other analogous protection thereon with the same legal force and effect as if executed by executive.  6. non-competition. while executive is employed at the employer and for a period of one (1) year after termination of executives employment (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary
or involuntarily), executive will not, without the prior written approval of the board, whether alone or as a partner, officer, director, consultant, agent, employee or stockholder of any company or other commercial enterprise, directly or
indirectly engage in any business or other activity in the united states or canada which competes with the employer in the sale of the pharmaceutical or other products being manufactured, marketed, distributed or developed by the employer while
executive is employed by employer and at the time of termination of such employment. the foregoing prohibition shall not prevent executives employment or engagement after termination of executives employment by any company or business
organization, as long as the activities of any such employment or engagement, in any capacity, do not involve work on matters related to the products being developed, manufactured, or marketed by the employer at the time of termination of
executives employment. executive shall be permitted to own securities of a public company not in excess of five percent of any class of such securities and to own stock, partnership interests or other securities of any entity not in excess of
five percent of any class of such securities and such ownership shall not be considered to be in competition with the employer. 
  11 


7. non-solicitation.  (a) while executive is employed at the employer and for a period of one (1) year after termination of such employment (for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntarily), executive agrees that
executive will not:  (i) directly or indirectly solicit, entice or induce any customer to become a customer of any other
person, firm or corporation with respect to products then sold or under development by the employer or to cease doing business with the employer, and executive shall not approach any such person, firm or corporation for such purpose or authorize or
knowingly approve the taking of such actions by any other person;  (ii) directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any
employee of the employer to work for a third party other than the employer (excluding newspaper or similar print or electronic solicitations of general circulation); or  (b) this section 7 does not apply to any general solicitation not focused to any group of customers itemized on a customer list of the employer. 
8. non-disparagement. while executive is employed at the employer and for a period of one (1) year after termination of such employment (for
any reason, whether voluntary or involuntarily), executive agrees to refrain from making any public statement about the employer, or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents that would disparage, or reflect unfavorably upon the image
or reputation of the employer, or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates or agents.  9. general provisions. 
(a) executive acknowledges and agrees that the type and periods of restrictions imposed in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this agreement
are fair and reasonable, and that such restrictions are intended solely to protect the legitimate interests of the employer, rather than to prevent executive from earning a livelihood. executive recognizes that the employer competes worldwide, and
that executives access to confidential information makes it necessary for the employer to restrict executives post-employment activities in any market in which the employer competes, and in which executives access to confidential
information and other proprietary information could be used to the detriment of the employer. in the event that any restriction set forth in this agreement is determined to be overbroad with respect to scope, time or geographical coverage, executive
agrees that such a restriction or restrictions should be modified and narrowed, either by a court or by the employer, so as to preserve and protect the legitimate interests of the employer as described in this agreement, and without negating or
impairing any other restrictions or agreements set forth herein.  (b) executive acknowledges and agrees that if executive
should breach any of the covenants, restrictions and agreements contained herein, irreparable loss and injury would result to the employer, and that damages arising out of such a breach may be difficult to ascertain. executive therefore agrees that,
in addition to all other remedies provided at law or at equity, the employer shall be entitled to have the covenants, restrictions and agreements contained in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 specifically enforced (including, without limitation, by
temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions and restraining orders) by any state or federal court in the commonwealth of pennsylvania having equity jurisdiction and executive agrees to subject executive to the jurisdiction of such court.

(c) executive agrees that if the employer fails to take action to remedy any breach by
executive of this agreement or any portion of the agreement, such inaction by the employer shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by executive of the same or any other provision, agreement or covenant. 
(d) executive acknowledges and agrees that the payments and benefits to be provided to executive under this agreement are provided as
consideration for the covenants in sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 hereof.  10. survivorship. the respective rights and obligations of the
parties under this agreement shall survive any termination of executives employment to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations.  11. mitigation. executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and there shall be no offset
against amounts due executive under this agreement on account of any remuneration attributable to any subsequent employment that executive may obtain.  12. recoupment policy. executive agrees that executive will be subject to any compensation clawback or recoupment policies that may be applicable to executive as an employee of the company, as in
effect from time to time and as approved by the board or a duly authorized committee thereof, to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act.  13. notices. all notices and other communications required or permitted under this agreement or necessary or convenient in connection herewith shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
given when hand delivered or mailed by registered or certified mail, as follows (provided that notice of change of address shall be deemed given only when received):  if to the company, to:  auxilium pharmaceuticals, inc.

(a) this agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and

agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, except that the duties and responsibilities of

particular circumstances, it shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in all other circumstances.  16. remedies cumulative; no
