xiii. section 409a and section 280g

 
a). section 409a.
 
1. compliance with section 409a. to the extent applicable, this agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the “code”), and department of treasury regulations and other interpretative guidance issued thereunder (collectively, “section 409a”). notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, if the company determines in good faith that any compensation or benefits payable under this agreement may not be either exempt from or compliant with section 409a, the company shall adopt such amendments to this agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially-reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (a) preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits payable hereunder, preserve the economic benefits of such compensation and benefits, and/or avoid less favorable accounting or tax consequences for the company and/or (b) exempt the compensation and benefits payable hereunder from section 409a or comply with the requirements of section 409a and thereby avoid the application of penalty taxes thereunder; provided, however, this section xiii does not, and shall not be construed so as to, create any obligation on the part of the company to adopt any such amendments, policies or procedures or to take any other such actions or to indemnify the executive for any failure to do so.
 
2. six-month delay. notwithstanding any provision of this agreement to the contrary, in the event any payment or benefit hereunder is determined to constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to section 409a, then to the extent necessary to comply with section 409a, such payment or benefit shall not be made, provided or commenced until six months after the executive’s termination of employment. lump sum payments will be made, without interest, as soon as administratively practicable following the six-month delay. any installments otherwise due during the six-month delay will be paid in a lump sum, without interest, as soon as administratively practicable following the six-month delay, and the remaining installments will be paid in accordance with the original schedule.

3. separate payments. for purposes of section 409a, the right to a series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments. each separate payment in the series of separate payments shall be analyzed separately for purposes of determining whether such payment is subject to, or exempt from compliance with, the requirements of section 409a.
 
4. reimbursements. notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or additional taxes under section 409a, amounts reimbursable to the executive under this agreement shall be paid to the executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to the executive) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.
 
b). section 280g.
 
1. anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by the company to the executive or for the executive’s benefit (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this agreement or otherwise) (the “payments”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 (or any successor provisions) of the code, or any interest or penalty is incurred by the executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, is hereinafter collectively referred to as the “excise tax”), then the payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that such reduction would result in the executive retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes and the imposition of the excise tax), than if the executive received all of the payments. the company shall reduce or eliminate the payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination.
 
2. all determinations required to be made under this section, including whether and when an adjustment to any payments is required and, if applicable, which payments are to be so adjusted, shall be made by an independent accounting firm selected by the company from among the four (4) largest accounting firms in the united states or any nationally recognized financial planning and benefits consulting company (the “accounting firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the company and to the executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the executive that there has been a payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the company. in the event that the accounting firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change of control, the executive shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the accounting firm hereunder). all fees and expenses of the accounting firm shall be borne solely by the company. if the accounting firm determines that no excise tax is payable by the executive, it shall furnish the executive with a written opinion that failure to report the excise tax on the executive’s applicable federal income tax return would not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty. any determination by the accounting firm shall be binding upon the company and the executive.
