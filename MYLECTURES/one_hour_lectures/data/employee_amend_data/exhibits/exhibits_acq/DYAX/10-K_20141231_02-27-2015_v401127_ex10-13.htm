amended and restated
executive retention agreement
 
this amended and restated
executive retention agreement ("agreement"), dated effective as of ______________ ___, 20__ (the "effective
date"), is entered into between dyax corp., a delaware corporation with offices at 55 network drive, burlington, massachusetts
01803 ("dyax" or the "company") and ___________________ (the "executive") amends
and restates that certain executive retention agreement (the “existing retention agreement”) between the company
and executive dated ____________________ (the “original effective date”).
 
whereas, the executive
is an executive officer and key member of the dyax management team.
 
whereas, dyax believes
that it is in the best interests of the company and of its stockholders to provide for the continuity and retention of its executive
officers, including the executive.
 
whereas, the existing retention
agreement is being amended so that it includes each type of award that may be subject to the terms hereof.
 
now, therefore, as an inducement
for and in consideration of the executive remaining in the employ of the company and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the company and the executive agree that the executive shall receive
the severance payments set forth in this agreement in the event the executive's employment with the company is terminated under
the circumstances described below.
 
1.             definitions.

 
capitalized terms that
are not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in exhibit a attached hereto.
 
2.             employment
status.
 
the executive acknowledges
that this agreement does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the company any obligation to retain the executive
as an employee and that this agreement does not prevent the company or the executive from terminating his or her employment at
any time, for any reason, before or after a change in control.
 
3.             term
of agreement. 
 
3.1           term.
this agreement, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall take effect upon the effective date and shall continue
through the third anniversary of the original effective date (the "term"); provided, however, that that
the term shall be extended as follows:
 

(a)annual extension. commencing on third anniversary of the original effective date and each
anniversary of the original effective date thereafter (each hereinafter referred to as a "renewal date"), the
term shall be automatically extended for one additional year so as to terminate one year after such renewal date, unless at least
one year prior to such renewal date, the company shall have given the executive written notice that the term will not be extended.
 

 
 

 

(b)extension following change in control or termination of employment. if a change in control
shall have occurred during the term, then the term shall automatically be extended for an additional year until one year after
the closing of the transaction giving rise to the change in control. if either a termination of employment covered by section 5.1
or a change in control covered by section 5.2 shall have occurred during the term, then the term shall be extended through the
severance period (or to such later date by which the company has fulfilled all of its obligations under section 5).
 
4.             notice
of termination of employment. 
 
4.1          notice
of termination. any termination of the executive's employment by the company, or by the executive prior to the first anniversary
of a change in control (other than due to the death or disability of the executive) shall be communicated by a written notice to
the other party hereto (the "notice of termination"), given in accordance with section 8.2. any notice of termination
shall: (i) indicate (in the case of a termination by the company) whether such termination is for cause and (in the case of a termination
by the executive within one (1) year following a change in control) whether such termination is for good reason, (ii) to the extent
applicable, set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the executive's
employment for cause or for good reason, and (iii) specify the termination date.
 
4.2           timing of notice.
 

(a)any notice of termination for cause given by the company must be given within ninety (90) days
of the initial existence of the occurrence or condition that constitutes cause.
 

(b)any notice of termination for good reason given by the executive must be given within thirty (30)
days of the initial existence of the occurrence or condition that constitutes good reason. if the condition is capable of being
corrected, the company shall have thirty (30) days during which it may remedy the condition (the "cure period").
notwithstanding the occurrence of any such event or circumstance, such occurrence shall not be deemed to constitute good reason
if such event or circumstance has been fully corrected within the cure period. if the condition is not corrected, the executive
must leave employment within ninety (90) days after the company fails to cure the condition giving rise to the executive's claim
for good reason during the cure period.
 
5.             benefits
to executive. 
 
5.1           termination
prior to change in control. if, prior to a change in control (including a situation in which a change in control never occurs),
the company terminates the executive's employment other than for cause, disability or death, then notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any prior agreement, the executive shall be entitled to benefits described in subsections (a) through (d)
below, the distribution of which shall be subject to the provisions of sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.8.
 

(a)the company shall pay to the executive on the termination date, in a lump sum, in cash (less applicable
withholdings), (i) all base salary and accrued vacation pay earned by the executive through the termination date (the "accrued
obligations"); and (ii) the executive's actual incentive bonus earned, based on the achievement of corporate and individual
goals through the date of executive's termination; provided however, that if any portion of the executive's actual incentive bonus
earned is not determinable as of the date of termination, executive shall receive for that portion an amount equal to the pro rated
portion of executive's annual target bonus, based upon the number of days during such calendar year that the executive had been
employed prior to the termination date.

(b)during the severance period, the company shall continue to pay to the executive, in accordance
with the company's regular payroll practices, the executive's base salary.
 

(c)during the severance period, the company shall continue to provide coverage to the executive in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable welfare benefit plans of the company in effect on the termination date;
provided, however, that if the executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive a particular type
of benefits (e.g., health insurance benefits) from such employer, then the company shall no longer be required to provide those
particular benefits to the executive.
 

(d)with respect to any awards granted to the executive by the company prior to the termination date:

shall continue to vest through the severance period;

term of any such award; and
 

(iii)any performance-based awards shall have such terms as are set forth in the grant agreement applicable
thereto.
 
the executive acknowledges and agrees
that the provisions of this section 5.1(d) may cause all stock options which had previously been qualified as incentive stock options
under section 422 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code", which term shall include applicable
treasury regulations) to become non-qualified options and lose, irrevocably, any tax-advantaged treatment previously available,
except to the extent that the effectiveness of such provisions would permit such options to qualify as a grant of new incentive
stock options under section 422 (in which case the exception shall be applied by the company to the options with the lowest exercise
prices as incentive stock options up to the $100,000 limit in section 422).
 
5.2           termination
following change in control. if the company terminates the executive's employment other than for cause, disability or death
within twelve (12) months following a change in control, or if the executive terminates his or her employment for good reason within
twelve (12) months following a change in control, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any prior agreement,
the executive shall be entitled to benefits described in subsections (a) through (d) below, the distribution of which shall be
subject to the provisions of sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.8:
 

(a)the company shall pay to the executive on the termination date, in a lump sum, in cash (less applicable
withholdings):
 

(i)the accrued obligations;
 

(ii)the executive's annual target bonus for the calendar year in which the termination occurred, pro-rated
based upon the number of days during such calendar year that the executive had been employed prior to the termination date; and
 

-3-
 

 

(iii)an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the executive's annual base salary and target
bonus.
 

(b)during the severance period, the company shall continue to provide coverage to the executive in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable welfare benefit plans of the company in effect on the termination date;
provided, however, that if the executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive a particular type
of benefits (e.g., health insurance benefits) from such employer, then the company shall no longer be required to provide those
particular benefits to the executive; and
 

(c)with respect to any awards granted to the executive by the company prior to the termination date:
 

(i)any awards that are subject to time-based vesting and unvested as of the termination date shall
become immediately exercisable effective as of the termination date; and
 

(ii)all awards that have an exercise period, including without limitation stock options, shall remain
exercisable by the executive for ninety (90) days following the conclusion of the severance period but in no event beyond the maximum
term of any such award; and
 

(iii)any performance-based awards shall have such terms as are set forth in the grant agreement applicable
thereto.
 
the executive acknowledges and agrees
that the provisions of this section 5.1(d) may cause any stock options which had previously been qualified as incentive stock options
under section 422 of the code to become non-qualified options and lose, irrevocably, any tax-advantaged treatment previously available.
 
5.3          termination
for cause, disability or death. if the company terminates the executive's employment for cause, disability or death, whether
prior to or following a change in control, then the company shall pay the executive (or his or her estate, if applicable), in a
lump sum in cash on the termination date, the accrued obligations and (ii) to the extent not previously paid or provided, timely
pay or provide to the executive any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the executive is eligible
to receive following the executive's termination of employment under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract or agreement
of the company and its subsidiaries (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "other benefits"),
the distribution of which shall be subject to the provisions of section 5.8.
 
5.4             section
280g provisions.
 

(a)if the company undergoes a change in ownership or control (as defined below) and any portion of
the contingent compensation payments (as defined below) payable to the executive hereunder would constitute excess parachute payments
(as defined below), then, subject to section 5.4(b) below, the company shall reduce the contingent compensation payments
(as defined below) to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess parachute payments. for purposes of this section 5.4, the contingent
compensation payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the "eliminated payments" and the aggregate amount
(determined in accordance with treasury regulation section 1.280g-1, q/a-30 or any successor provision) of the contingent compensation
payments so eliminated shall be referred to as the "eliminated amount."
 

-4-
 

 

(b)notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in section 5.4(a), no such reduction in contingent
compensation payments shall be made if (i) the eliminated amount exceeds (ii) the amount of the excise tax imposed on the executive
by section 4999 of the code with respect to the excess parachute payments. the override of such reduction in contingent compensation
payments pursuant to this section 5.4(b) shall be referred to as a "section 5.4(b) override."
 

(c)for purposes of this section 5.4 the following terms shall have the following respective meanings:
 

(i)"change in ownership or control" shall mean a change in the ownership or effective
control of the company, or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the company, determined in accordance with
section 280g(b)(2) of the code.
 

(ii)"contingent compensation payment" shall mean any payment (or benefit) in the nature
of compensation that is made or made available (under this agreement or otherwise) to a "disqualified individual" (as
defined in section 280g(c) of the code) and that is contingent (within the meaning of section 280g(b)(2)(a)(i) of the code) on
a change in ownership or control of the company.
 

(iii)"excess parachute payment" shall mean a payment described in section 280g(b)(1)
of the code (calculated based on the applicable federal rate in effect on the original effective date with respect to stock options).
 

(d)any payments or other benefits otherwise due to the executive following a change in ownership or
control that could reasonably be characterized (as determined by the company) as contingent compensation payments (the "potential
payments") shall not be made until the dates provided for in this section 5.4(d).
 

(i)in the event that the company undergoes a change in ownership or control, and the executive becomes
entitled to receive contingent compensation payments relating to such change in ownership or control, the company shall (a) determine
at such time or times as may be necessary to comply with the requirements under section 280g of the code whether such contingent
compensation payments constitute in whole or in part excess parachute payments and (b) in the event the company determines that
such contingent compensation payments constitute in whole or in part excess parachute payments, notify the executive (within 30
days after each such determination and with reasonable detail regarding the basis for its determinations) of the following: (1)
which potential payments constitute contingent compensation payments, (2) the eliminated amount, and (3) whether the section 5.4(b)
override is applicable.
 

-5-
 

 

(ii)within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice to the executive, the executive shall deliver
a response to the company (the "executive response") stating either (a) that the executive agrees with the company's
determination pursuant to the preceding sentence, or (b) that the executive disagrees with such determination, in which case the
executive shall set forth (1) which potential payments should be characterized as contingent compensation payments, (2) the eliminated
amount, or (3) whether the section 5.4(b) override is applicable.
 

(iii)if and to the extent that any contingent compensation payments are required to be treated as eliminated
payments pursuant to this section 5.4 and the section 5.4(b) override is not applicable, then the payments shall be reduced or
eliminated, as determined by the company, in the following order: (a) any cash payments, (b) any vesting of equity awards, (c)
any taxable benefits, and (d) any nontaxable benefits, in each case beginning with payments or benefits that are to be paid the
farthest in time from the date that triggers the applicability of the excise tax, to the extent necessary to maximize the eliminated
payments.
 

(iv)if the executive fails to deliver an executive response on or before the required date, the company's
initial determinations shall be final, and the company shall make the potential payments (other than the eliminated payments) to
the executive within ten (10) business days following the due date for delivery to the company of the executive response (except
for any potential payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which potential payments shall be made on the date
on which they are due).
 

(v)if the executive states in the executive response that he or she agrees with the company's determinations,
the company's initial determinations shall be final, the contingent compensation payments that shall be treated as eliminated payments
shall be as set forth in the executive response, and the company shall make the potential payments (other than the eliminated payments)
to the executive within ten (10) business days following delivery to the company of the executive response (except for any potential
payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which potential payments shall be made on the date on which they are
due).
 

(vi)if the executive states in the executive response that he or she disagrees with the company's determinations,
then, for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery of the executive response, the executive and the company shall use good
faith efforts to resolve such dispute. if such dispute is not resolved within such thirty (30) day period, such dispute shall be
settled exclusively by arbitration in boston, massachusetts, in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association
then in effect. judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. the company shall, within ten
(10) business days following delivery to the company of the executive response, make to the executive those potential payments
as to which there is no dispute between the company and the executive regarding whether they should be made (except for any such
potential payments which are not due to be made until after such date, which potential payments shall be made on the date on which
they are due). the balance of the potential payments (other than eliminated payments) shall be made within ten (10) business days
following the resolution of such dispute.
 

-6-
 

 

(vii)subject to the limitations contained in sections 5.4(a) and (b) hereof, the amount of any payments
to be made to the executive following the resolution of such dispute shall be increased by amount of the accrued interest thereon
computed at the prime rate announced from time to time by bank of america, compounded monthly from the date that such payments
originally were due.
 

(viii)in the event the company is required to perform a redetermination in accordance with treas. reg.
1.280g-1 q/a-33(b) with respect to any contingent compensation payments, this section 5.4(d) shall apply with respect to such redetermination
and the parties shall make such adjustments as may be necessary as a result of such redetermination including, if appropriate,
the payment by the company of contingent compensation payments previously treated as eliminated payments if the section 5.4(b)
override applies as a result of such redetermination.
 

(e)the provisions of this section 5.4 are intended to apply to any and all payments or benefits available
to the executive under this agreement or any other agreement or plan of the company under which the executive receives contingent
compensation payments.
 
5.5           release.
the obligation of the company to make the payments and provide the benefits to the executive under section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 is conditioned
upon the executive signing a release of claims in the form attached hereto as exhibit b, or such other form as may be agreed
to by the company and the executive (the "employee release"), within twenty-one (21) days (the "release
period") following the termination date and upon the executive not revoking the employee release in a timely manner thereafter.
provided that the employee release has become binding, the payments to the executive under section 5.1 or 5.2 shall be payable
or shall commence on the 30th day following the termination date. notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of benefits under
section 5.1(c) and 5.2(c) shall continue during the release period and any applicable revocation period.
 
5.6           exclusive
severance benefits. the making of the payments and the provision of the benefits by the company to the executive under section
5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 shall constitute the entire obligation of the company to the executive as a result of the termination of his or
her employment under the circumstances set forth in such sections, and the executive shall not be entitled to additional payments
or benefits under any other plan, program, policy, practice, contract or agreement of the company or its subsidiaries.
 
5.7           mitigation.
the executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefits provided for in section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 by
seeking other employment or otherwise. further, except as provided in section 5.1(c) and 5.2(c), the amount of any payment or benefits
provided for in section 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned or benefits received by the executive as

the executive is a "specified employee" on the date of termination within the meaning of that term under code section
409a(a)(2)(b), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered deferred compensation under code
