yes i reply
cool he say and sound as if he mean it
distilled open in june on the corner of franklin street and west broadway in tribeca the former home of drew nieporent 's layla and centrico
the belly dancer and the frozen margarita machine be go but a certain effervescence remain
so do mr. nieporent hover in the background as guru to distilled 's owner the first time restaurateur nick iovacchini and shane lyons the 25-year old chef
the space be blandly handsome with dark wood and charcoal banquette breathlessly high ceiling and quasi medieval wheel chandelier like crown of fire
one side be devote to the bar where the drink by benjamin wood be lady killer elegant with a knife twist
occasionally 1980s mope rock shimmer from the speaker
service be confoundingly friendly almost coddle
when i stand outside read the post menu someone come hurry down the step to hand me my own copy so i would not crane my neck he say
on arrival and departure a host leapt to open the door
the mission statement that precede one meal we be a modern american public house the waiter intone be both unnecessary and slightly coy about mr. lyons 's ambition
yes wing be on the menu but they be jack up with gochujang korean ferment soybean and chile paste borrow perhaps from the larder at momofuku noodle bar where mr. lyons work for a year
there be occasional technical flourish like watermelon cube cryovaced to intensify their flavor and mushroom surround by puff of buttery onion soubise aerate by an isi siphon
a tousle of dehydrate and shave bacon adorn an open face sandwich of heirloom tomato and basil on sourdough a b.l.t. of course
sunflower sprout make up for the missing crunch
other classic be updated rather than upend popcorn dust with garlic cumin and brewer 's yeast which evoke cheese snappy pickle ferment with gochugaru korean red chile powder pork rib glaze with more gochujang tease the sweet salty border without stray too far in either direction
onion ring batter with yuengling beer and tapioca flour be fry then frozen a theatrical waiter boast that they have be bring to negative 60 degree and fry again
they arrive nicely sturdy the sole purpose of their existence to ferry the narcotic like condiment burn scallion cut with jalapeã±os and mayonnaise with the sting of preserve lime
the substantial burger which the menu modestly refrain from tell you be make with grass feed organic grain finish beef be abet by what may be the fine version of tater tots in town the grate potato cook until just underdone and then crisp with wondra flour
everything here go to 11 one diner marvel
duck breaded and fried like chicken be brazen and irresistible despite the oversweet accompany waffle a spongy slab of brioche dredge in custard like french toast
even broccoli turn wanton fling with sliver of duck bacon and pickled watermelon rind in a fish sauce vinaigrette with wait for it a dollop of duck fat
but liver pã¢te serve with plume of bake dehydrate chicken skin
now this be confrontational
my mission in life be to make skinny girl fat mr. lyons tell my table
he get a laugh but the crackling be abandon after one bite
the only logical end to such a meal be s'mores deconstruct as be the fashion with a hickory smoke graham flour cake a torch smear of marshmallow fluff dark chocolate pudding and graham cracker break on top
it be obvious and no less pleasurable for it

recently i attend two extraordinary dinner in new york one feature the precise focused red burgundy of rene engel and the other the exquisite cã´te rã´tie of marius gentaz
at their best these be the sort of wine that amplify the sense of wonder at the heart of greatness
they be reminder that no matter how rationally we try to analyze wine they show their true measure in the emotion they evoke
engel and gentaz be great example of wine that express all the distinctive beauty of their terroirs enhance by the personal touch of the winemaker
these two small family estate share another important characteristic they no longer exist
few passage in family business be more difficult to negotiate than the leadership transition from one generation to the next
ideally it occur seamlessly the parent cede control to the child while remain available to offer occasional advice and encouragement
but it may happen abruptly after sudden illness or death
it may be fierce as when oedipal drama interfere with judgment
or as in the case of engel and gentaz an estate hit a dead end with no heir to carry on
it ' in the nature of thing that estate come and go
most die off unmourned
their wine be not distinctive enough perhaps to be irreplaceable
yet for every great estate like jean louis chave of the northern rhã´ne say to have make wine continuously since 1481 the annals be replete with name now consign to history their wine to be savor wistfully or sell at auction for outlandish price bear of increase scarcity
henri jayer the legendary burgundian vigneron die in 2006 after retire some year before
his vineyard be now farm by his nephew by marriage emmanuel rouget whose wine be well respected but not revered
raymond trollat be for year the conscience of st.-joseph have adhere to traditional backbreaking agricultural method as others be take easy path
he retire in 2005 with no heir
i read recently that a bottle of his st.-joseph have sell at auction for $ 600 a ridiculous price for what be essentially a rustic but soulful village wine though perhaps not so ridiculous for the spirit of raymond trollat which be irreplaceable
noã«l verset play a similar role in cornas maintain the ancient tradition of this northern rhã´ne village through many lean year until the rest of the world learn to appreciate the wine
mr. verset retire and sell off his vine his wine surface occasionally like eloquent voice from the past
once a friend open a bottle of 1979 barbaresco from giovannini moresco a long go producer
what a beautiful legacy pure pale and elemental
it come and go so fast and sadly i have never see another bottle
alberico boncompagni ludovisi the prince of venosa produce his last wonderful bottle of fiorano from his estate within the city limit of rome in 1995
that year for reason he do not explain he tear out his vineyard
the prince die in 2005 and after year of legal wrangling the estate be divide among his heir who replant the vineyard
one day we will see whether the new wine bear any relation to the old
continuity be easy in some region
in bordeaux for example where so many chateau be in the hand of corporation it ' more a matter of replace employee and carry on
but bordeaux be not always so corporate
jean franã§ois fillastre the proprietor of domaine du jaugaret one of my favorite small bordeaux estate be 70 and have no heir
i wonder what will happen to it
if life be fair rene engel would still be in the hand of the engel family
philippe engel take over the estate in 1981 from his father pierre who die young and by all account philippe transform a good producer into a terrific one
but he too die young of a heart attack at 49 in 2005
with no heir it be sell to franã§ois pinault the billionaire who also own chã¢teau latour and be now call domaine d'eugenie and be still discover its personality
at the small engel dinner at dbgb on the bowery we drink six bottle of grand cru burgundy clos vougeots from 1999 96 91 and 90 and grands ãchezeauxs from 99 and 98
as a group the wine be elegant subtle and complex yet with a touch of rusticity that seem to give them individuality
the 98 grand ãchezeaux especially stand out
it be beautifully calibrate and clear spicy floral and burst with energy
the 99 grand ãchezeaux likewise show great finesse while the clos vougeots be rich and plumper lovely but maybe not with the same sense of intricate detail
we toast the memory of philippe engel and those who have know him tell story of this adventurous man who enjoy boating party and travel the world
by contrast marius gentaz never go far from his home in ampuis
in many way his life have more in common with the 19th century than the 21st
he farm less than three acre on the dizzyingly steep slope of cã´te rã´tie and essentially make his wine label gentaz dervieux by hand
he begin in wine in 1947 with his father in law then work on his own from 1952 until 1993
when he retire his vine go to his nephew rene rostaing who blend them into his excellent cã´te rã´tie
but they be not gentaz dervieux
at the dinner put on at bar boulud by the rare wine company an importer several dozen of us drink 14 vintage from 1993 back to 1978
to drink any one of these bottle could have be the zenith of a wonderful meal to have 14 be overwhelming
and each seem to have a story to tell about a place and a man and a time when life be live locally
collectively these be gentle wine yet with a tensile strength that belie their graceful structure
they be savory and meaty typical of syrahs from the northern rhã´ne yet complex gorgeously fragrant mellow yet insistent
if i be press to reveal my favorite i would say that i love the soft 93 the ripe 90 and the ethereal 83
but the 88 be almost otherworldly in its beauty while the 87 be surprisingly open full and harmonious and the 85 still deep and dense with a mosaic of aroma and flavor that have many year to go to express themselves fully
it ' bittersweet to drink wine like these know that each open bottle be one less to go around
yet it ' also a time to celebrate that part of the human spirit that allow us to see beyond ourselves know that memory travel further than flesh
shin star doctor sleep stephen king 's much-â­anticipated sequel to the shining be not on the hardcover list yet its official release date be sept. 24 but back in 1977 the shining do spend time there on its way to become a cultural touchstone
it also sell well in paperback especially after stanley kubrick 's 1980 film adaptation
the shining be king 's third novel and both the book review and the daily new york times pay attention though king may have wish they have n't to say that stephen king be not an elegant writer jack sullivan grouse in the book review be put it mildly
the daily 's reviewer richard r. lingeman be not much kinder the evil be slapdash unfocused and eventually preposterous he write
king be a natural but he lack control he simply rear back and let fly with the fireball and a lot of wild pitch result
the criticism apparently sting
sale be not all important king later tell lingeman
we all want to be nominate for a national book award
i grow up read king and the literary establishment have gradually come around in 2003 the national book foundation award him a medal for distinguished contribution to american letter
the ballad of jail reading
in next week 's issue lauren groff will review peter orner 's new story collection
last car over the sagamore bridge
orner have never hit the best seller list despite critical acclaim but he do have a recent brush with the wild side of popular fiction as the expert witness in a lawsuit involve a california prisoner 's right to read werewolf erotica
the plaintiff an inmate at pelican bay state prison successfully appeal after his copy of mathilde madden 's silver crown be confiscate
at stake in the case be the very tricky and very subjective issue of literary value orner tell me via e mail
as a fiction writer you can not really say no when someone ask you to read some werewolf erotica especially for a good cause
and i would say the right to read wherever you be be a pretty good cause
orner end up tear through the book he say
i tend to be a very slow reader
i read the silver crown fast the prose really move let 's say
i wish i have as much action in my own book
orner study law and have work in prison both in a legal capacity and as a write teacher
he ' sympathetic he tell me to their challenge
but he would tend to allow most book
correctional officer have to enforce discipline in an incredibly tough environment he say
pelican bay be one of the most violent prison in california
they have get some extraordinarily serious problem
my humble thought speak as a writer be that an inmate read a book about werewolf have sex be the least of their problem
i have plan to spend a week at the end of the summer on an island off the sicilian coast
sunny sky and blue water be to be follow by a night or two in palermo and a few day in the countryside visit fabrizia lanza director of the anna tasca lanza cook school where the main activity be pick and cook vegetable from the garden for every meal
alas my summer whiz by and the vacation become an impossible mission
to console myself i begin to cook
with farmer market produce at its peak i can approximate some remember dish from previous visit and fabrizia 's cookbook come home to sicily fill in the blank by give actual recipe to follow
there be an unusual pesto sauce from nearby trapani make with basil coarsely chop almond and ripe tomato
there be a zesty eggplant caponata and savory baked eggplant involtini
not so easy for a city cook to reproduce be a beautiful dish of artichokes roast on glow hot ember but i be go to try
the book be arrange by season so the reader get a sense of a work sicilian farm kitchen throughout the year begin with the first shoot of wild fennel in the spring and all the attendant seasonal project and ritual
of course there be fish dish and meat dish too most imbue with the scent of herb and garlic
but they have a definite southern sensibility strikingly different from northern italian cooking
i find myself draw to a simple stovetop lamb stew call spezzatino di agnello season with only a pinch of saffron and a splash of wine then shower with lot of chop mint
fabrizia cut lamb shoulder into cube to make this but since my butcher have beautiful thick cut shoulder chop i decide to make mine with those
once assemble this fragrant stew take only about an hour to cook
it have a bright flavored lightness that make it ideal for these still rather balmy september evening
i serve it with plain boil potato nothing more be need
while i will remember the summer of 2013 as the one i do not spend in sicily the meal i have be cook lately have have a distinctly sicilian accent
this year it seem the vacation be happen right in my own kitchen
before i eat my way around catalonia i assume that the great and sadly late penelope casas recipe for romesco sauce from her book the foods and wines of spain be the only one i would ever need
deservedly a classic it ' a rich and piquant puree make from sweet dry spanish pepper along with tomato garlic almond vinegar and oil pound with breadcrumb as a binder
it ' marvelous on simply cook fish tasty stir into seafood stew and make a fine top for pretty much any vegetable sturdy enough to hold its own against the thick pungent sauce
but once i get to catalonia i meet romescos of other persuasion
some be spicy and as runny as tomato sauce
some be as thick as hummus and smoky with char dry chile
one memorably complex version which i have write about before be spike with sweet almond biscuit and enrich with hard cook egg and garlic confit then dolloped on slim green onion call calcots
none of this be to knock ms. casas 's excellent recipe
nor do it imply that when it come to romesco sauce anything go
but it do give me license to take a few liberty
the first be to skip the sweet dried pepper call noras that i have always think be essential
they be indeed very nice but also hard to come by unless you plan ahead not my strong suit
instead i substitute broil red bell pepper
not only do the fresh pepper add a fleshy sweetness and smokiness from the fire they be also plentiful this time of year and beg for a noble purpose
for a mild kick and to intensify the smokiness i throw in a bit of smoke hot paprika
and instead of almond or a mix of almond and hazelnut i rely solely on hazelnut for an earthier note
the result can be use nearly anywhere a brightly flavor sauce or condiment be require and will keep in the fridge for at least a week
in her various book ms. casas recommend use romesco on grill tuna as a sauce for shrimp and lobster or slick over potato and green bean in a substantial salad
here i have toss it with quickly blanch broccoli which be crisp and light but hearty enough to stand up to this very bold sauce

giglio italy after a costly painstaking and potentially perilous operation to raise the batter hull of the cruise ship costa concordia engineer say early tuesday that they have succeed in right the ship remove it from two granite reef where it run aground last year kill 32 people
the 19-hour highly complicated salvage operation have manage to completely rotate the ship lean it on an underwater platform build underneath the engineer say
this be an important visible step franco gabrielli head of italy 's civil protection agency tell reporter at 4 a.m. accompany by applause from a few resident who have stay up all night to follow the operation
the rotation happen in the way we think and hop it would happen echo franco porcellacchia project manager for costa cruises the ship 's operator
there be no evidence so far of any impact to the environment
if there be debris to be remove we will do it tomorrow
as part of the vessel emerge in the late afternoon on monday discolored and rusting from the water where the concordia have languish list on its side engineer say the operation would most likely take long than initially plan
salvage expert have say the dimension of the stricken 951-foot vessel make the operation unparalleled in the annals of marine salvage as more than 500 diver technician engineer and biologist prepare the ship for what be know as parbuckling to bring it upright and minimize environmental risk to giglio island a marine sanctuary
use huge jack cable pulley and specialized equipment the salvage effort have be set to begin at first light but a sudden storm prevent worker from move a barge and rubber boom close to the ship
three hour after work start engineer say the first phase of the operation ease the vessel away from its rocky perch be go accord to plan
these hour be the most uncertain as we could not establish how much the hull be wedge say sergio girotto project manager with micoperi the project 's underwater construction and offshore contractor
now we have to guide it into the desire position
the next phase of the salvage engineer say involve settle the wreck on an artificial seabed make of bag of cement next to underwater steel platform

gaia pianigiani report from giglio and alan cowell from london
berlin chancellor angela merkel get good and bad news on sunday from germany 's economically powerful state of bavaria her conservative allies capture an absolute majority in election for the regional parliament but her current liberal partner in the national government fail to make the cut
in a race that be scrutinize as an indicator of the national mood before sunday 's federal election the disastrous showing of just 3 percent for the free democrats well short of the 5 percent need to enter any german legislature make it less likely that ms. merkel would be able to form another coalition government with them after the national vote
the christian social union the bavarian party that govern in partnership with ms. merkel 's christian democratic union secure 47.7 percent of the vote in the 180-seat state legislature accord to official result
that would translate into 101 seat for the conservative 10 more than need to form a majority government
the conservative party main rival the social democrats win 20.6 percent of the vote or 42 seat accord to the initial official result
that reverse a downward trend with credit universally give to christian ude a former journalist who have for 20 year be a highly popular mayor of munich
under germany 's election system voter be able to cast two vote one for a party and one for a candidate
this can lead to result in which the percentage of voter do not always correlate directly with the number of seat a party win
the conservative party main rival the social democrats win just over 20 percent of the vote on sunday accord to the initial official result
the year 2008 be history
we be back a beam horst seehofer bavaria 's state premier and leader of the christian social union say minute after the first exit poll herald his triumph
five year ago the bavarian conservative lose the absolute majority they have enjoy for 56 year turn to the pro business free democrats to form a government that mirror ms. merkel 's coalition in berlin
sunday 's outcome stir anxiety in berlin where the continuation of ms. merkel 's current coalition government be dependent on a strong showing by the small party which have struggle at the national level
despite ms. merkel 's comfortable lead in the poll over her main rival peer steinbrã¼ck concern be grow that she may have no choice but to try to form a government with his center leave social democratic party if the free democrats fail to make the crucial 5 percent threshold or barely cross it
the free democratic party 's leader philipp rã¶sler seek to rally supporter nationwide by single out bavaria as unique
we all know that thing be different in bavaria and from now on it ' all about germany mr. rã¶sler say add that this result be a wake up call
the greens receive about 8.5 percent of the vote while the free voters a bavarian party that oppose germany 's euro zone policy hover around 9 percent the state election monitor say on its web site
the mood for a change in the land be just not there say theresa schopper a greens leader in bavaria in an unusually frank assessment
her party have struggle nationally this year in part because of a poorly communicate message widely see as raise tax for many
the conservative strong showing will not necessarily translate into equal success for ms. merkel next week
there be some fear that bavarians who make up germany 's second strong voting bloc could be less inclined to go to the poll two week in a row
and those who want to see the free democrats hang on may well use their second party vote that way rather than cast it for ms. merkel 's party
at her party 's headquarters in berlin on sunday night the tension be palpable
in addition mr. seehofer 's strength could prove a problem for ms. merkel even if she be return to office
his interpretation of conservatism have remain more traditional while she have steer her party toward more leftist issue like create more publicly run day care center and decide to shut down germany 's nuclear power plant
while bavaria 's capital munich have become a diverse metropolitan area home to some of germany 's most powerful industrial and high tech company much of the rest of the state be rural and socially conservative
the area still hold strong tie to the roman catholic church and its unique cultural identity stem from its history as an independent kingdom
bavaria have the low unemployment rate of germany 's 16 state with only 3.8 percent of its 12.5 million inhabitant out of work and there have be grow unease in the state with germany 's system under which economically strong state distribute some of their tax earnings among weak region
london in an old church annex in northwest london the wall of the cutler gross office be line with color eyewear that look like fragment of stain glass window
the analogy be apt as ever since 1969 when the optician graham cutler and tony gross set up a store in the upscale knightsbridge district the brand have exhibit an almost religious fervor about handmade glass
today with the 30-year veteran marie wilkinson as its design director the company continue to sell its own 1,000 style while expand relationship with some of fashion 's trendy designer
the license with giles deacon thomas tait victoria beckham and maison martin margiela be not especially lucrative say majid mohammadi the company 's co owner and chief executive
but they do allow the eyewear maker to develop design with like minded creative people who buy the glass for resale under their own label
work on eyewear help designer articulate their point of view and they in turn be ambassador for wear glass ms. wilkinson explain
mr. deacon say he have be wear the company 's logo free frame for year before he approach the executive in 2009 seek a collaboration
i have always really respect the quality and the simplicity of the design that they make he say
they come from an aesthetic which be just a bit different from the norm which i think be really attractive
he add that he feel comfortable share his offbeat reference from kurt cobain to the scooby doo character velma with someone like ms. wilkinson
for mr. deacon 's spring 2013 collection cutler gross create oversize round glass that feature inlaid pearl and crystal above the brow
as mr. mohammadi describe it the designer value the company 's quality over quantity approach
we can not do mass production and distribution
we be like savile row suit rather than boss suit which he continue may be very good but they 're not handmade that ' the bottom line
everything from mill lens groove to fit hinge be do by its craftsman in italy where the brand own two factory
the second site establish only this year in the northern city of cadore have allow specialist like metalworker or artisan who cut acetate to work together
but with production base in italy why keep the design team in london
it come down to the heritage say ms. wilkinson and the english mixture of irreverence and correctness that be a hallmark of design by mr. cutler and mr. gross
a pair of cutler gross sunglass may retail for â£350 or about $ 560 compare with the â£220 that gucci may charge but the difference between the production cost be massive say mr. mohammadi
he will not be specific but he acknowledge the brand 's margin be significantly small than those of large company while add that it spend nothing on promotion or marketing
mr. mohammadi who own the business with mr. cutler mr. gross have a stroke and retire in 2009 predict the new factory will double the brand 's production capacity help to meet demand in the brand 's 600 point of sale in 60 country include a newly open store on mercer street in the soho neighborhood of new york
as for further expansion the brand have vague plan for more store
mr. mohammadi say it should open in tokyo and milan but i be not in a rush
it take me three year to open one in new york
as a cash rich private company if we want to open a store we 're not at the mercy of anyone
we take our time
seoul south korea south korean soldier shoot and kill a man who be make a rare attempt to enter north korea from the south the defense ministry say monday

paris secretary of state john kerry and the foreign minister of france and britain say on monday that they would not tolerate delay in dismantle syria 's chemical weapon and would press ahead with a strong resolution in the united nations security council to enforce the disarmament plan
it be extremely important that there be no evasion william hague the british foreign secretary say at a joint news conference
refer to president bashar al assad of syria mr. kerry say if assad fail in time to abide by the term of this framework make no mistake we be all agree and that include russia that there will be consequence
a major question however be whether the united states and its allies be pursue the short term goal of dismantle syria 's chemical arsenal at the expense of their ultimate objective of press mr. assad to relinquish power
the schedule for eliminate syria 's chemical weapon be ambitious all of them be to be eliminate by the middle of 2014
and expert say that meeting such a schedule will depend heavily on the cooperation of the assad government
laurent fabius the french foreign minister insist that there be no contradiction between the disarmament goal and the long term diplomatic objective because remove mr. assad 's chemical arsenal would undermine his military position and would eventually smooth the way for his ouster
it will be a weakening of his position mr. fabius say
he must understand that there be no military victory
mr. kerry make a similar point
we be take a weapon away from him that he have be use against his people he say while acknowledge that the syrian military have also use conventional artillery and airstrikes indiscriminately against the population
mr. fabius emphasize the importance of increase support for the syrian opposition much of which have express a sense of betrayal over the united states decision to put off a military strike
in order to negotiate a political solution we need a strong position mr. fabius say
we therefore intend to strengthen our support to syrian national coalition rebel
if you want to change the assad regime without fall in the hand of the terrorist you have to support the moderate opposition
mr. fabius remark that much of the public appear to think that the choice in syria be between mr. assad 's government and islamic militant but he say that be false
mr. fabius say the syrian opposition would be invite to an international meeting in new york that would be convene on the margin of the united nations general assembly whose formal session open next week and be schedule to continue into early october
the framework plan on quarantining and destroy syria 's chemical arsenal be work out by the united states and russia on saturday but now need to be incorporate into a security council resolution
under the framework agreement the term of the accord be to be include in a resolution under chapter 7 of the united nations charter which would authorize punitive measure if syria do not comply
while russia would almost certainly veto any security council endorsement of a military strike other measure could include disrupt syria 's mean of communication as well as impose economic sanction
in addition mr. kerry have say the united states remain prepared to launch a unilateral strike if syria fail to meet its commitment
mr. kerry say that every representation of compliance by the syrian government would be verify
nothing can be accept at face value or in word alone he say
mr. hague add that britain france and the united states be intent on prevent syria from engage in a cat and mouse game
the pressure be on them to comply with this agreement in full he say
the world must be prepare to hold them to account if they do n't and our three country be certainly determined to do so

the main or headline inflation rate include food price which be often volatile
late planting and disruption in the supply of vegetable include onion because of heavy summer rain have fuel food inflation
onion price jump 51 percent from july to august
monday 's release be the last major data point before mr. rajan a former i.m.f. chief economist hold his first policy meeting friday
development in the currency market suggest that r.b.i. should be in a position to start reverse its tightening measure
however they have to be careful as market could interpret it as tolerate high inflation say a. prasanna an economist with icici securities primary dealership in mumbai refer to the central bank the reserve bank of india
the high inflation number dampen market expectation that mr. rajan would begin to roll back some of the measure put in place by his predecessor in a bid to arrest a sharp decline in the rupee since may.
he have already warn he do not have a magic wand to deal with india 's economic crisis but as he have be dub the guv by a gush indian medium hope be high he can find a formula to stabilize the rupee calm inflationary pressure and at the same time set off a revival in economic growth

paris policy maker be hop a general election next sunday in germany will allow the important business of integrate europe to finally move forward but they hardly expect a radical shift in germany 's stance on major issue
from athens to lisbon and paris to rome government want berlin get behind a banking union and also adopt a more expansionist economic policy to help drive growth and fight unemployment in stagnant euro zone economy
european official largely expect chancellor angela merkel to win a third term
many hope that ms. merkel a conservative will have to form a grand coalition with the center leave social democrats or s.p.d. whose pro europe leaning tend to make them more open to stimulus measure than the current partner in the govern coalition the center right free democratic party or f.d.p.
but even if ms. merkel be force to team up with the more liberal s.p.d. germany 's stance on major european issue be unlikely to shift
whoever be elect the constraint that merkel have face will remain the same for any german government say sylvie goulard a french representative to the european parliament who be a member of the liberal democratic movement party
hostile public opinion and institution that strictly interpret european union law will continue to bind germany 's movement make it difficult for the government to share the financial burden of fellow euro zone member
ms. merkel and her s.p.d. challenger peer steinbrã¼ck barely mention european and foreign policy in their only television debate except to agree that germany should have no part in any military response to the use of chemical weapon in syria
mr. steinbrã¼ck accuse ms. merkel of bungle the euro zone crisis by go slow and inflict a poisonous dose of austerity measure on greece and other bail out country
he keep silent about s.p.d. 's support for pool some euro zone debt sense a vote loser
the chancellor note that the s.p.d. have vote for all of her euro zone bailout proposal but she offer no personal vision of europe 's future
with the survival of the common currency no longer under threat and financial market calm for now policy maker expect ms. merkel to stick to her small step approach to euro zone integration unless the crisis flare again
the need for further financial support for greece portugal and perhaps ireland will cause much grumpy debate in berlin
frustration at chronic italian political instability and french aversion to liberal economic change will smolder
perhaps as important for german policy as the election result may be a ruling by the federal constitutional court next month on the european central bank 's effort to hold euro zone member 's borrowing cost in check by buy their bond which calm the crisis when the e.c.b. president mario draghi announce the initiative last year
the german court be not expect to declare the bond buy illegal but it may set condition that could make the policy hard to implement
germany will build europe at its own pace and on its own term
the others need to swallow and understand this say ulrike guerot who represent germany on the european council on foreign relations
if they try to rush us it will take long
at the same time berlin be expect to continue to insist that europe be give bind control over national budget as a condition for provide financial support to other euro zone member she say
divergent view hold by germany and the rest of the world as to the cause of the european debt crisis will also slow any progress

the u.s. federal reserve remain the most powerful central bank in the world
its policy action reverberate in every corner of the globe something no other central bank can claim
even the hint of a taper the withdrawal of easy money policy have roil emerge market
the prospect of rise interest rate in the united states have lead investor to pull back from risky investment in those country
emerge market like brazil india and indonesia be face plunge currency and decline stock market
low interest rate in the united states have lead investor to look to emerge market for better return on their money fuel boom in equity and real estate market as well as high inflation in some country
for the previous two year emerge market have be complain about how these inflow fuel by cheap money in the united states cause their currency to appreciate too rapidly hurt their export competitiveness
the fact that those same currency be now tumble have lead to the opposite complaint that the fed should back off more slowly from its earlier policy and better communicate its intention to financial market
give the global impact of the fed 's action the choice of a replacement for ben bernanke as chairman of the federal reserve be be watch with keen interest
no matter who be choose there be important change in store for central bank and financial market the world over
despite the global economic crisis financial market be now more closely connect then ever before
china india and other major economy have continue remove restriction to capital flow open up their market to cross border investment
give this increased mobility action by any of the major central bank have effect well beyond their own national border
moreover in the aftermath of the crisis central bank have become even more important to economic management take on much of the burden of control inflation improve financial stability and promote growth
this be a difficult balancing act in the best of time
it become virtually impossible when fiscal and other policy be work at cross purpose
in the united states for instance short term fiscal tightening along with the uncertainty associate with deficit and debt ceiling negotiation that repeatedly go down to the wire have hobble the recovery
meanwhile little have be do to tackle the long term fiscal problem especially entitlement spending
the focus on short term austerity have limit productivity enhance expenditure in such area as infrastructure and education
in india the government have be unwilling to undertake politically unpopular reform to tackle large budget deficit and structural problem such as stifle labor market regulation
this have leave it to the maker of monetary policy to do all the heavy lifting
other emerge market face similar issue
the reliance on central bank to make up for the failing of other policy have create inevitable international tension
the right monetary policy for one country may not necessarily be what be good for another
unlike fiscal policy whose effect tend to stay mostly domestic monetary policy do affect currency value and financial market in other country through cross border financial flow
whoever take over from bernanke the reality be that the fed chairman have a mandate to focus only on domestic objective
fair enough no central bank in the world have anything but domestic objective in its mandate
but when the fed act it matter to the world in a way that no other central bank 's action do
in a report by a committee of academic and former central banker in which i participate we argue that the fed and a small group of central bank from both advance and emerge market economy should hold regular meeting and issue a report on their monetary policy intention
even if this procedure only expose mutual inconsistency in policy it would be a way to bring broad pressure on politician to stop rely on the crutch of monetary policy and prod them to take politically unpopular measure to improve productivity and the prospect of long term growth while make global capital flow more stable
so who would the rest of the world vote for to head the most important central bank
now that lawrence summers have withdraw from the race the presumptive front runner be janet yellen
many central banker view her as someone who be empathetic to the spillover effect of u.s. policy someone who have enough credibility to soothe financial market and ably steer the fed
in any event no matter who get the job what many of the world 's central banker be hop for be a fed that can go back to the more mod objective of maintain low inflation and financial stability
on that at least there be certainly international agreement

john brown munich
in that threat work sept. 13 nicholas d. kristof suggest a three track strategy in syria that include expand support of moderate rebel
that be precisely the wrong strategy
it be not in america 's interest to see a rebel victory which will bring either islamic militant to power or chaos
our choice be not between bad and good dictatorship and democracy it ' between bad and bad
to that end we should not arm the rebel moderate or otherwise
many of the rebel may be moderate even believer in some form of democracy without the slight notion of what that be or how to get there
but many be also islamic extremist bend on do away with a secular regime
the best outcome for the united states and i believe for the syrian people would be a negotiate settlement in which president bashar al assad or his government remain in power but with some form of constraint

president obama recently declare that the united states be the world 's old constitutional democracy and he be echo by timothy egan a brilliant mess sept. 14 without challenge
it be nonetheless a historically dubious claim
that honor may belong to either iceland or switzerland though the detail be open to debate
but since the united states do not allow equal voting right for all its citizen until 1965 its democracy by that standard must be count young
and true democracy still elude the country when money be consider a form of free speech and representation of the poor be subject to open mockery

stock and bond market around the world jump on monday after lawrence h. summers withdraw from consideration as chairman of the federal reserve
the equity surge begin in asia a few hour after mr. summers write president obama that any possible confirmation process for me would be acrimonious and thus not in the nation 's best interest
the rally roll across europe and gain steam on wall street where the dow jones industrial average surge by 1 percent before pull back modestly
it close at 15,495 up nearly 0.8 percent or about 119 point
the broad base standard poor 's 500-stock index be up 0.6 percent for the day
mr. summers 's unexpected move on sunday come shortly before the american central bank meet to decide whether to scale back its bond purchase or quantitative easing from the current pace of $ 85 billion a month
the decision leave many analyst short list for lead candidate for the fed leadership down to just janet l. yellen the current no.â2 under the chairman ben s. bernanke whose term expire in january
ms. yellen be perceive by some in the financial market as likely to maintain the current course rather than move quickly to scale back the fed 's year long economic stimulus effort
christian schulz an economist in london with berenberg bank say investor concern about mr. summers stem from the fact that he have not speak much on the topic of monetary policy while ms. yellen have a long track record of support mr. bernanke 's policy
mr. summers seem less convinced that such a blunt instrument as quantitative easing be the right tool mr. schulz say
it be clear he be not as big a fan
it seem likely that president obama will choose yellen which be good in term of the prospect of the fed stay on hold for some time say peter cardillo chief market economist at rockwell global capital in new york accord to reuters
of course there be always chance that the fed may begin to announce the trim on wednesday but that ' already be bake in the market mr. cardillo say

but emerge market be the most relieve by mr. summers 's retreat
equity index in indonesia up 3.4 percent the philippines 2.8 percent argentina 2.1 percent and singapore 1.9 percent be among the sharp gainer
their rally underscore the widespread belief that the bernanke bubble have help bolster the emerge market
fear that the cheap money would dry up have prompt turmoil in recent week
still many fed watcher believe the policy difference between ms. yellen and mr. summers be not substantive
both would be concern about the sustained level of high unemployment and likely to tap the brake on stimulus slowly
in that sense the market euphoria monday be surprising to some
the united states currency fall marginally against other major currency with the euro gain 0.33 percent against the dollar to $ 1.3338 and the dollar fall against its japanese counterpart to 99.10 yen
analyst at bnp paribas write that there have be a knee jerk sell off of the dollar on the summers news but that it would not last

grand theft auto v be still an action game about hoodlum and thief we start with an extended bout of cop killing and proceed to a series of increasingly ambitious heist
but the structure feel more logical than before
your character do not arrive as an outsider in a new city and start carry out the request of people whose only purpose be seemingly to delay him
instead the event flow from situation and desire
for the first time there be three controllable character instead of only one franklin a repo man on the make lose his job michael a witness protection retiree miscalculates after find his wife cheat on him with her tennis instructor and trevor an oddly lovable psychopathic meth dealer and gun runner learn that michael his onetime partner fake his death 10 year ago
i 've get an imbalance michael tell his psychiatrist
one minute i be one person and the next minute i be another person
a retire or newly unretired bank robber michael be examine his struggle to control his criminal impulse
he may as well be analyze the dissonance that afflict grand theft auto iv. that game 's protagonist niko bellic would fret in animate sequence about the cost of his life of violence
but under the control of many video game player niko would subsequently embark on act of gleeful creative murder that belie the story the game want to tell about him
be these two man the one in the story 's animation and the one manipulate by the player really the same person
with the three character structure of grand theft auto v rockstar find an answer to that riddle
that seamlessness between narrative and interactive be something that we have work on everywhere say sam houser the sometimes reclusive co founder of rockstar games who agree to be interview after i have spend more than 45 hour inside the game 's world
most video game be about repeat action about master a skill and exploit it
grand theft auto game be about variety
there ' the array of content include radio station d.j.'d by the like of bootsy collins entire tv show with name like republican space rangers and a fake internet
and there be the mission the character execute encompass car boat and plane chase paparazzo ambush train robbery and triathlons
failure in the new game be less frustrating than in previous iteration since a generous checkpointing system mean that player do not need to restart a mission from the beginning if they do not get it right the first time
there ' even an option to skip the action sequence after repeat attempt have go awry
for all that the game do right it have a genuinely problematic aspect that be not its enthusiasm for violence or sex but its lack of interest in woman as something other than lustful airhead notwithstanding a late game cameo by mr. houser 's mother geraldine moffat a british actress of the 1960 and 70s

still on the budget fight most democrats in congress support the president and with his comment he seek to rally them and to set up republicans for blame should the fiscal fight end badly
mr. obama note that in the past republicans fight for more spending cut to reduce deficit but that now with annual deficit decline they be make their fight over the health care law
the affordable care act have be the law for three and a half year now mr. obama say
it pass both house of congress
the supreme court rule it constitutional
it be an issue in last year 's election and the candidate who call for repeal lose
the republicans in the house have try to repeal or sabotage it about 40 time
they fail every time
meanwhile the law have already help million of americans

those include the decision to support president george w. bush 's bailout of wall street mr. obama 's own bailout for the auto industry and the passage of the economic stimulus program
but while the unemployment rate have fall to 7.3 percent down from a high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 million of americans be still struggle to find a job and million more be work at low wage or part time job and have trouble make end meet

a united nations report release on monday confirm that a deadly chemical arm attack cause a mass killing in syria last month and for the first time provide extensive forensic detail of the weapon use which strongly implicate the syrian government
while the report 's author do not assign blame for the attack on the outskirt of damascus the detail it document include the large size and particular shape of the munition and the precise direction from which two of them have be fire
take together that information appear to undercut argument by president bashar al assad of syria that rebel force who be not know to possess such weapon or the training or ability to use them have be responsible
the report commission by secretary general ban ki moon be the first independent on the ground scientific inquest into the attack which leave hundred of civilian gas to death include child early on aug. 21
the repercussion have elevate the 30-month old syrian conflict into a global political crisis that be test the limit of impunity over the use of chemical weapon
it could also lead to the first concerted action on the war at the united nations security council which up to now have be paralyze over syria policy
the report make for chilling reading mr. ban tell a news conference after he brief the security council
the finding be beyond doubt and beyond the pale
this be a war crime
mr. ban decline to ascribe blame say that responsibility be up to others but he express hope that the attack would become a catalyst for a new diplomatic determination at the united nations to resolve the syrian conflict which have leave more than 100,000 people dead and million displace
there be no immediate reaction to the report from the syrian government
but just two day before the report be release syria officially agree to join the international convention on ban chemical weapon and the united states and russia which have repeatedly clash over syria agree on a plan to identify and purge those weapon from the country by the middle of next year
syria have say it would abide by that plan
the main point of the report be to establish whether chemical weapon have be use in the aug. 21 attack in the damascus suburb of ghouta an area long infiltrate by rebel
the united nations inspector conclude that chemical weapon have be use in the ongoing conflict between the party in the syrian arab republic also against civilian include child on a relatively large scale
the weapon inspector who visit ghouta and leave the country with large amount of evidence on aug. 31 say in particular the environmental chemical and medical sample we have collect provide clear and convincing evidence that surface to surface rocket contain the nerve agent sarin be use
but the report 's annex detail what the author find be what catch the attention of nonproliferation expert
in two chilling piece of information the inspector say that the remnant of a warhead they have find show its capacity of sarin to be about 56 liter far high than initially think
they also say that fall temperature at the time of the attack ensure that the poison ga heavy than air would hug the ground penetrate low level of building where many people be seek shelter
the investigator be unable to examine all of the munition use but they be able to find and measure several rocket or their component
use standard field technique for ordnance identification and crater analysis they establish that at least two type of rocket have be use include an m14 artillery rocket bear cyrillic marking and a 330-millimeter rocket of unidentified provenance
these finding though not present as evidence of responsibility be likely to strengthen the argument of those who claim that the syrian government bear the blame because the weapon in question have not be previously document or report to be in possession of the insurgency 1 2 next page

for me this be the turning point in the war he write in a 1996 memoir the defiant a true story of jewish vengeance and survival
he continue instead of constantly be on the run or hide underground try to survive i have actually participate in an attack on the german war machine
this be the beginning of my revenge

so here we be fight against a common enemy the germans whose aim it be to totally annihilate the jewish people and to take over the soviet union side by side with fellow fighter whose own hatred of jews be notorious mr. yoran write

in this demoralizing situation i tell myself again and again that i be fight as a jew with them but not as one of them

after the defiant be publish mr. yoran frequently speak publicly about his experience as a partisan
if there be a lesson to be glean it be that no person should succumb to brutality without put up a resistance he write in his book

individually it can save one 's life en masse it can change the course of history
the question be about the future and carmelo anthony respond with four word of practice reassurance
i 'm not go nowhere he tell bloomberg television last week in an attempt to soothe the nerve of antsy knicks fan
strain syntax aside it be the sensible thing to say perhaps the only thing to say
it may even be true although predict the whim of an n.b.a. superstar be always a dicey proposition
ten month from now anthony will probably opt out of his knicks contract sign a five year deal for $ 129 million and happily resume his role as the basketball prince of broadway
anthony love new york and new york love anthony playoff failure notwithstanding
he have every reason to stay the money the market the chance to be the savior who end the knicks 40-year championship drought
it be only two and a half year ago that anthony force the denver nuggets to send him here
it seem unlikely he would leave so soon
but a lot can change in 10 month and the specter of anthony 's free agency will shadow the knicks all season just as the threat of his departure loom over the nuggets three year ago
the circumstance be different of course
anthony flee denver for reason beyond basketball
his wife lala an actress want the broadway spotlight
carmelo want the madison avenue connection
as anthony mention in that same interview last week out there in denver from a business standpoint i do not have all of the outlet that i have right now in new york
i be not able to take advantage of all the opportunity and all the people that i know here in new york
those be powerful force and anthony may stay base on those consideration alone
but when the fashion show be over and all the shoe have be sell there will still be basketball to be play
that be where the uncertainty lie
the knicks be 7 14 in the playoff since anthony arrive with two first round exit
they win 54 game last season their best record in decade but they hit that mark in a down year for the eastern conference and still fail to reach the conference final
the knicks may have already peak
their chief rival have only grow strong
the indiana pacers who oust the knicks in the semifinal have since add luis scola and will welcome back a healthy danny granger
the chicago bull will have derrick rose back
the nets have add paul pierce kevin garnett and andrei kirilenko
the miami heat still have lebron james
the knicks improve marginally add metta world peace beno udrih and andrea bargnani while lose jason kidd chris copeland and steve novak
but kidd 's departure and the retirement of kurt thomas and rasheed wallace leave a huge leadership gap in a locker room desperate for cool head and wise word
it be kidd who coax j. r. smith and anthony into a smart team orient game last season and it be kidd who help keep the combustible smith on course
the knicks may have the high volatility index in the league with world peace smith and kenyon martin
the roster be deep but awkwardly assemble
amar'e stoudemire be a poor fit between anthony and tyson chandler but he may be even bad on a second unit with bargnani another scoring minded defensively challenge big man
the glut of power forward may push anthony back to small forward rob the knicks of the explosive small lineup that prove so effective last season
the knicks be still miss a true co star for anthony
their second best scorer be the flighty smith who will open this season with a five game drug suspension
how patient will anthony be
he turn 30 in may.
his next contract be likely to be his last as an elite player
if a championship be his goal he have to wonder whether the knicks have the vision and the flexibility to surround him with the right player
as it stand the knicks appear no close to championship contention today than they be a year ago
the franchise will have a chance to reboot in 2015 when the contract of chandler stoudemire and bargnani expire create enough salary cap room to sign another star or two
but that opportunity be two year away and anthony have not show an appetite for rebuild
he have cite the nuggets plan overhaul in 2011 as the reason for his trade demand
anthony will be eligible for an extension feb. 22 and he could remove any doubt about his intention by sign then
but he stand to make much more by opt out in july and he will almost certainly wait
in the meantime what if the knicks crash and burn
what if stoudemire 's knee give out again
what if smith fail another drug test
what if as many commentator expect the knicks fall a few notch and cede the spotlight to the rival nets
what if they lose in the first round next spring
how secure will anthony feel about his future then
new york be still new york
but there be another city that can offer heady dos of fame fortune and brand promotion and it happen to be home to the n.b.a. 's most glamorous franchise
the los angeles lakers will have million in salary cap room next summer and a powerful recruiter in kobe bryant one of anthony 's close friend
per n.b.a. rule the lakers could offer anthony only $ 96 million over four year
but they can offer something the knicks can not a tradition of success a knack for acquire and build around superstar and a habit of stag parade in june
maybe anthony be not go anywhere as he assert last week
but verbal commitment and loyalty be malleable concept in professional sport
nothing mean anything until the contract be sign
berlin this week transatlantic trends publish the annual public opinion survey conduct by the german marshall fund of the united states
the trend be always fascinating because they give a sense of public opinion attitude on both side of the atlantic and how wide or narrow those difference be over certain foreign policy issue
this year the survey focus mostly on the war in syria and other issue concern the middle east
accord to a preview of the data it be clear that in europe the public be highly skeptical of any military intervention in syria
on average 70 percent of those ask in 10 european country and turkey oppose intervention
the trend show that european public do not trust the use of force say ian lesser director of the german marshall fund 's brussels office
this have serious implication for european foreign defense and security policy he add
europe 's ambition to develop a coherent foreign and security policy recently take a battering when the leader of the european union 's two most important military power britain and france fail to win public support for a military strike against syria
david cameron the british prime minister suffer a humiliating defeat by lawmaker during a vote on british participation in a possible airstrike lead by the united states against syria
conservative lawmaker say the vote show not only that mr. cameron be unable to control his own backbencher but also that he have underestimate the increase tendency toward isolationism include anti americanism in his own political camp
the british public react to the vote with enormous relief
in a country that lose hundred of troop in afghanistan every public opinion poll have show that britain be not prepare to back the united states with troop again especially as the obama administration seem prepared to bypass the united nations security council
franã§ois hollande the french president have remain commit to the possibility of military action even as the united states and russia negotiate how to persuade syria to relinquish its chemical arsenal
when mr. hollande intervene in mali this year he have wide public support
but syria be a different matter
the transatlantic trends report show that 65 percent of those poll in france oppose any intervention
it be become much more difficult to get public support for the use of force say henrik heidenkamp security expert at the royal united services institute in london
in the foreseeable future no british leader will dare commit the country to use force before take public opinion into account
analyst wonder whether mr. hollande would indeed take the risk in intervene in syria without public support
bypass the public could turn into too much of a political risk
what seem to be happen be that voter across europe be begin to resemble the germans in their attitude toward the military
they be become more cautious inward look and reluctant to use force
this be heighten by a sharp sense of disappointment with president obama 's foreign policy as the transatlantic trends report suggest
chancellor angela merkel of germany who be seek re election for a third term on sunday at no time allow herself to be draw into any debate about the use of force
she know full well that german public opinion be strongly against any military action
even the chemical weapon attack do not seem to shock german all that much despite their abhorrence over how the nazis use such deadly weapon during world war ii. not only do the europeans not back any military effort they do not seem all that engage in the diplomatic effort either
with few exception there be no push by european union member state or catherine ashton the union 's foreign policy chief to pursue the diplomatic channel or to propose that syria 's chemical weapon stockpile be bring under international inspection
europe be not pursue all the diplomatic and political option say marcin terlikowski security expert at the polish institute of international affairs
in the end it be president vladimir v. putin of russia harshly criticize by the united states for support the syrian president who take center stage by propose international supervision of the chemical weapon
these trend may be point to a new europe in which the political resolve for serious diplomacy be lack among the european union 's 28 member state and the conviction to enforce international weapon convention be largely absent
these trend be not comfort to the obama administration
over the past several year u.s. defense secretary have repeatedly criticize their european allies for be unwilling to spend more on defense share scarce military resource or make tough decision about the use of force
yet if europe as a whole be become more skeptical of the military the late transatlantic trends report show that the american public also increasingly oppose the use of force at least when it come to syria
accord to the survey 62 percent of americans poll oppose military intervention compare to 55 percent a year ago
give this war weariness it be hardly surprising that mr. obama postpone seek a vote from congress
this aversion to force say analyst may reflect a grow realization that military force carry a very high price though it often yield only limited result
force can overthrow dictator as in the case of iraq and libya or the taliban in afghanistan
but the instability now in all three country have as the transatlantic trends report show encourage skepticism among europeans and americans about the use of force
if european refuse to consider force as a last option to support diplomatic effort analyst believe that the european union 's foreign policy will be toothless

federal health official report monday that at least two million americans fall ill from antibiotic resistant bacteria every year and that at least 23,000 die from those infection put a hard number on a grow public health threat
it be the first time that federal authorities quantify the effect of organism that many antibiotic be powerless to fight
the number of death be substantially low than previous estimate in part because researcher from the centers for disease control and prevention strip out case in which a drug resistant infection be present but not necessarily the cause of death
infectious disease doctor have long warn that antibiotic resistance in which bacteria develop defense against antibiotic use to kill them threaten to return society to a time when people die from ordinary infection
they have come up with hard number where it have be only guesswork say dr. stuart b. levy a professor of microbiology at tufts university and the president of the alliance for the prudent use of antibiotics
this set a baseline we can all believe in
in 2007 the c.d.c. estimate that about 100,000 people die every year of infection they develop while in hospital
most of those infection be believe to be resistant to some antibiotic but not necessarily the most widely use one
and it be unclear how many of the death be cause by the drug resistant infection
monday 's report quantify that
dr. steven l. solomon the director of the c.d.c. 's office of antimicrobial resistance acknowledge that the report underestimate the number but say that be by design
researcher be instruct to be conservative and to base their calculation only on death that be a direct result of a drug resistant bacterial infection
this be a floor dr. solomon say
we want the clean number the least subjective number
one point of contention have be the extent to which industrial scale animal farming contribute to the problem of antibiotic resistant infection in human
the government have estimate that more than 70 percent of antibiotic in the united states be give to animal
company use them to prevent sickness when animal be pack together in way that breed infection
they also use them to make animal grow faster though federal authorities be try to stop that

i lay on my back with my teeth clenched and my hand grip the side of a hospital bed
a crowd of stranger in white coat fill the tiny room
wave of pain lap from my abdomen into my chest as the venom work its way toward my heart
an experimental antivenin drug be about to be inject into my bloodstream and while i wait for the needle to go in i reflect that if anyone in the world be the right person to be bite by a black widow spider i be that guy
as a professional outdoorsman i spend a lot of time around thing that can bite claw stab or otherwise attack me
i have be lucky with snake and reckless with bear
i have have some close call with lionfish
it figure that the thing to finally nail me would be live on my own front porch
the black widow 's graceful form and red hourglass mark have make it america 's most recognizable spider
the eastern specie latrodectus mactans be common from florida to new york and as far west as texas
but despite their fearsome reputation black widow be surprisingly shy and retire
over the course of your life you have probably walk past hundred of black widow without even realize it
each one pack enough venom to lay out a heavyweight boxer for day yet globally only a few people each year be kill by widow bite
widow web be easy to identify messy and close to the ground
i spot the first one knit against the step of my front porch in albemarle county va.
a little black ballerina be balance in the back of it
i regret kill her but she be too close to an area where my child play
i blast her with wasp spray and she drop out of her web
i hunt for more to photograph and eliminate
the perimeter of my house turn out to harbor a village of black widow web
i rack up as many as a dozen little black and red trophy a day
fascinate by our proximity i seek to learn more about these deadly neighbor
the black widow be unfairly name
female spider rarely kill the male after mating and possibly only in captivity
the male look very different from the mature female he be small and brownish
the hourglass marking be quite variable in both sex
both sex carry the same venom but the female have more of it and their fang can inject it deep
one winter day i carry inside a basket my child have leave on the front lawn
i notice a withered looking black widow cling to its side still alive but stiff and slow with the cold
i drop her into a mason jar and for three month she live on my desk on a diet of moth
i learn a lot about black widow just by observe her
they be awkward outside their web
they be poor climber compare with other spider unable to scale the side of a jar
i be surprised that my pet widow never use her venom first
when confront by prey that be too large or aggressive she back off rather than bite
one warm spring afternoon i decide to go fishing for dinner
on the same front porch where i have remove so many black widow i keep a pair of water shoe and some fishing tackle
i put the shoe and the tackle in my car and drive eight mile to my favor hole
i don the shoe before walk to the edge of the water
within about a dozen step i feel a stinging sensation on the second toe of my left foot as if there have be a thorn inside the shoe
then the pain increase to about that of a wasp 's sting
i sit on a rock and remove the shoe
the squash remains of a spider be smear across the insole
i realize instantly what must have happen a black widow from the porch have make its home in my shoe
for a long moment i star at my throbbing toe and wonder what to do
some people be more affect by the venom than others
most healthy adult experience a lot of pain and recover on their own
but others become incapacitated and some die
which group would i fall into
or have i be bite by something else entirely
why make a big deal out of nothing
i decide to wait and find out before get behind the wheel
i dip my foot into the cool water and decide i may as well pass the time by fishing 1 2 next page
jackson landers a nature writer be the author of eat alien one man 's adventures hunting invasive animal species
a friend of mine never understand why his neighbor spend a lot of money on thing he do not care about like house and car
to him these thing be not worth the money
so one time when he be be particularly grumpy about it i ask him about his family 's spending habit
i have notice that compare with most family i know his family appear to spend a lot of money on vacation and even more on recreational gear
my friend be a smart guy take only a moment to see the disconnect
both my friend and his neighbor have make a decision that it be worth it to them to spend more on thing and experience that they really value
it ' not unusual to spend more money on the thing that really matter to us
we probably all have something we refuse to substitute for a cheap option
however when we do spend more without build a framework for make these decision it ' the kind of behavior that can blow up budget and lead us to spend more on thing that be not worth the extra money
here be a few thing to keep in mind 1
it make sense to spend more if we want something to last longer
a few year ago i have my eye on a new road bike
the bike i want be not cheap and i debate buy a less expensive option
but when i start weigh the purchase in term of want to ride the bike for year the more expensive better build bike make more sense
i still have and love the bike
time matter when we 're debate spend more
when we anticipate use something over a long period of time it ' important to compare the cost of replace a cheap version two or three time
if the cost be comparable the more expensive option could be the better choice
2
it make sense to spend more if we want rare specific experience
i imagine more than a few of you roll your eye when i share my love of expensive ice cream
part of the reason i enjoy it so much be the anticipation
i do not eat it often only once every few week
however the pleasure i get from anticipate that next pint be almost worth the price alone
i would not feel the same way if it be not a rare experience
so when you want to spend more on something specific remember to consider the value of anticipation and how often you plan on do it
the rare the event the great the anticipation and research show that anticipate a future event like a vacation can match or even beat the happiness of the event itself
it ' the rare two for one deal that make it worth spend more if we have make the smart decision to save and plan for it
3
it do not make sense to spend more if it ' not a priority
sometimes the generic be just as good as the brand
unlike my ice cream i rarely opt for the most expensive laundry soap
now some of you may be really particular about your laundry soap
the point be when we spend more we need to consider both reason 1 and 2 and if it ' a purchase that actually matter to us
if the option be interchangeable then go for a less expensive choice
do not get in the habit of spend more for the sake of spend more
4
it do not make sense to spend more if it ' about compete with people
my friend do not care about his neighbor car and house
for him spend more on vacation and gear he really want be what matter
so do not forget the phrase keep up with the joneses when decide what something be really worth
commit to spend more only on the thing and experience that matter personally
it do not matter what our neighbor or friend want
focus on what matter to you and your family and ignore what everyone else be do
spend a lot of money on something even something we would consider a luxury do not mean we 're make a bad money decision
it may even be the best decision
but to reach the point of know it ' a good decision we need to be really aware of why we want to spend more and do our best to align the decision with our value
the more we can make money decision that support our value the less likely we be to regret those decision even if they 're expensive choice
keep that thought in mind the next time you wonder if it ' really worth it to spend more
brace yourself sometimes the answer will be yes

the aesthetic of the current tenant could perhaps be best describe as lavish vampire with an enthusiasm for dark wall heavy drape and in an upstairs den what appear to be a monstrous elephant skull
they have even forsake flower box for two conical tree at the top of the stoop
the bone of the house however be untouched and since the house have be sell only three time since it be complete in 1896 a rare trove of original detail be still intact
because they 're pay so much money it ' a pretty high maintenance job ms. houlton vinyl say
her husband kosmo vinyl who incidentally be once a manager for a punk rock band the clash act as the brownstone 's superintendent and have to be available to the tenant more or less around the clock
in addition to writing ms. houlton vinyl work as a receptionist at a law firm largely so her family can have health insurance she say

everything have change the venue no longer the hyper modern financial district high rise but a shamble brick warehouse
the pert girly style of his former collection have burst into ripe femininity
every detail seem perfectly select from shoe slightly 1930 with their fold back flap or the crocodile clip close a shoulder strap or hold up a swathe of skirt
out of all this the clothes give or take a flare of metallic glitter or the cut out piece have a normality and beauty that make them at once original but wearable

they be wear over the top and skirt often transparent in crunchy lace
mr. bailey have a way of create link to his other collection the visible lace underpants or a sudden flurry of polka dot pattern
but this show without a hard edge have a sweet serenity
the erdem collection seem to have the sweetness of marriage in mind give or take the clumpy shoe that be presumably design to grind the intricate lace and light chiffon all in black and white

london only a select few have ever hear of bellville sassoon
it be not that the british couture house do not have its fan for more than five decade bellville sassoon 's gown grace palace society ball and the red carpet
but the designer belinda bellville and david sassoon do not like to talk about their work
the couture house 's typically british stiff upper lip have be loosen for a new exhibition
the glamour of bellville sassoon to open sept. 20 at the fashion and textile museum in london
it will run through jan. 11
bellville sassoon favor discretion over publicity which mean they have an amazing career that a lot of people do not really know about say dennis nothdruft the curator who plan the exhibit as part of the museum 's 10th anniversary celebration
ms. bellville hire mr. sassoon after see his royal college of art graduate collection in 1958
belinda be a classic deb type and know all the great society lady of the day mr. sassoon say in an interview at the exhibition site
the company change its name from bellville et cie to bellville sassoon in 1970 and mr. sassoon take ownership when ms. bellville retire in 1981
the exhibition will display about 80 bespoke and ready to wear creation date 1959 to 2012 when mr. sassoon close his chelsea workshop
couture order dwindle toward the end so retirement sort of happen to me and after 55 year i would earn my rest say mr. sassoon now 81
we have to virtually beg borrow and steal to get the dress for the exhibition he add
so many be one offs and it never occur to me to keep any for myself
the designer say the house have dress absolutely every female member of the british royal family you can think of with the exception of the queen as well as most of europe 's royal family a clutch of jordanian princess and several shaykhahs of qatar
glitzy but untitled client include catherine deneuve madonna and julie christie
i love the early 70 best mr. sassoon say
it be my period the excess the high demand for couture and there be plenty of fabulous ball
anecdotes trip off the couturier 's tongue
he describe a 1960 visit to buckingham palace to fit a bridesmaid gown for princess anne then 9 queen elizabeth 's great anxiety be whether the dress be washable
in 1967 he arrive at kensington palace for an appointment with princess margaret a moody woman and find her hide in the basement whitewash the wall in a burgundy velvet yves saint laurent smoking suit with a polythene bag over it
audrey hepburn be so polite and effortless and liz taylor be late but very charming
bellville sassoon be perhaps best know for dress diana princess of wales
mr. sassoon estimate he create more than 70 outfit most notably her pink go away suit to start her honeymoon and the extravagant pale blue organza gown she wear to a victoria albert museum event in november 1981 the night before the announcement she be pregnant with her first child
while it may be hard to believe that one of the princess 's favorite couturier house be reticent about the spotlight belinda be funny about publicity mr. sassoon say and besides we be too occupy with sell to our customer

in 1987 the designer lorcan mullany be hire to increase the house 's ready to wear line

from the late 80 couture get small and smaller and ready to wear take over sale partly because people do not want to spend that kind of money but also because they do not have the time mr. sassoon say
woman with big career just could not justify the fitting
not that the ready to wear come cheap he add during the last year piece cost up to â£2,000 or â£3,000 but that ' compare to a piece of couture that we would sell for â£20,000 or $ 32,000 1 2 next page
q. why do lobster turn from dark blue green to red when boil
and why be they that dark color in the first place
a. a relatively simple explanation for the color change emerge in a study publish in 2002 heat change the shape of a protein call beta crustacyanin in the shell relax its bond with the pigment astaxanthin
the free pigment reflect wavelength of light in the red spectrum
but it turn out that the heat relate shape change account for only about a third of the color difference accord to a 2005 study by dutch researcher in the journal of the american chemical society
the new research point to a complex quantum physic interaction that would account for a much large shift and for the live lobster 's original color
when the red pigment be fully hide in the enclose protein it absorb all wavelength of light red as well as blue and green so the lobster appear black
the previous research have find that the red pigment molecule be group in pair within the crustacyanin cross each other in a tight x formation
the dutch researcher calculate that they interfere with one another cause shift in their quantum energy state thus alter the wavelength of light that be absorb
use nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to examine protein pigment interaction the researcher find that this effect be a large one suggest that it be the primary source of lobster color.â â question@nytimes.com
brooklyn bridge park have plenty go for it already the waterfront promenade the little corner where you escape into nature the playground and soccer field
but it could use more wide open green space place to picnic or throw a frisbee the kind of free for all gathering spot synonymous with the exercise of democracy and the flirtation of sunbather
and another architectural landmark in the city never hurt
voilã a new plan which should win city approval shortly would give pier 6 off atlantic avenue a flowering meadow with seasonal grass a sprawling field and a triangular wooden viewing platform
that ' at the southern end of this spectacularly successful 1.3-mile long brooklyn park where there ' already a maze of child 's playground
the meadow and field would add breathing room to the pier and a mini great lawn float serenely over the east river
more to the point the proposal also envision a new work of public architecture whose distinctive shape its architect describe as a manta ray
a manta ray or maybe a humongous tostito in any case a triangular platform step and undulating do for brooklyn bridge park sort of what the boathouse do for central park
create a visual anchor for that end of the park as well as for the riverfront it would become a perch from which to look not just over the harbor but also back at brooklyn
the platform be by the danish whiz kid bjarke ingels who be angle to become the next big thing in architecture
his firm bjarke ingels group know as big have be grab headline and commission with design that seem tailor make for glossy magazine spread
among them be the pyramidal torquing apartment complex with a courtyard nearly the size of a football field now under construction on west 57th street at the hudson river
at 39 mr. ingels have his formal tic already but also a knack for turn architecture into landscape which in essence be the task here
the brief be to complete the ground devise for the undeveloped area of pier 6
michael van valkenburgh the brooklyn base landscape architect whose firm have oversee the design of the whole park have plan the meadow as a destination point for the walking path from atlantic avenue and the big lawn to work as a single grand space with the platform at the end of the pier
mr. ingels 's 6,000-square foot design which would command drop dead view of lower manhattan have a baroque lilt with twist step fan out from the platform 's north side
where a corner of the platform coincide with the north corner of the pier the platform would be raise 17 foot on stilt to produce an effect resemble the prow of a ship
the architect call this the work 's â titanic moment he mean the movie not the wreck the point to which one or two people could climb and stand at the railing gaze out over the city
in essence the architecture invite us all to come to a spot where we can feel alone
the design 's wave allude to the water and echo the soft curve of mr. van valkenburgh 's hill and path
at night when light go on along the step and within the bench below the platform would become a giant outdoor dan flavin sculpture
should audience congregate for concert it could be a stage or seat for 300 people
the structure would cost $ 8 million all to be raise privately
brooklyn bridge park exemplify the sort of public private venture the bloomberg administration have champion with public space the priority but dependent on private money
city authorities just choose midtown equity a brooklyn developer to convert the historic empire stores the waterfront warehouse north of the bridge that belong to brooklyn bridge park
the store will be turn into office and retail space with restaurant and the brooklyn historical society on the ground floor
in turn the project will throw off cash to operate the park
it ' a deal similar to the one for the hotel and residential complex now under construction on pier 1 which the new york architect jonathan marvel have conceive for the developer toll brothers and starwood
mr. marvel 's design defer to the park
the park should enhance the complex
i use to live on atlantic avenue above the damascus bakery and remember the grim walk west toward the waterfront
that be a trip to nowhere
now even on a midweek morning pier 6 be buzz with child young parent bikers and volleyball player
since the park open in 2010 it have transform the entire neighborhood
the diversity of the people who use it prove that it serve the whole borough
mr. ingels 's platform would add to it as an elegant slab of contoured wood light than concrete allow its support column to remain thin
for the space underneath the platform would provide a seamless billow roof allow for dozen of people to find some shade and relax at waterside cafe table
it ' only a pity that the require wheelchair ramp and its railing along the structure 's edge mean that the platform feel partly disconnected from the lawn
the plan now await the public design commission 's go ahead and a patron for mr. ingels 's project
brooklyn and the city deserve both
archer fla. the rumble of a distant lawn mower the whoosh of a passing motorist and the buzz of a pesky fly hang in the air at bronson speedway
the rural quiet of a warm saturday allow ann young the owner of the small town racetrack here to listen to her doubt
maybe she have make the wrong decision when she buy the speedway in 2011
maybe run a short track on the weekend about 1,100 mile from her family and her home in new york be not worth the effort
bronson speedway sit on 36 grassy acre just outside the florida town for which it be name
bronson population 1,100
the wood plank grandstand do not quite reach the top of the sabal palm that brush up against the scoring tower
a black and white checkered sidewalk lead to a white wood panel concession stand with three red frame window
a collectible store stand a few foot away but there be no souvenir inside and the door appear to be paint shut
i just feel like there ' a reason why i need to be here young say
i do not really know what it be yet
the idea to buy the track start almost as a joke when young and her husband chris 60 be discuss a retirement project at their home in calverton n.y. in 2010
ann young 55 have be a register nurse for 34 year work her way up from a nursing school in brooklyn to run the operating room at brookhaven memorial hospital medical center in patchogue n.y.
but her family 's passion have always be auto racing
young have be go to racetrack since she be 5
chris race car for more than four decade
and their son christopher 19 start race at 14
to humor her husband ann young search online use the phrase racetrack for sale and the word bronson speedway appear in the result
know nothing about bronson fla. or how to run a racetrack she read on
a visit to bronson and month of negotiate land the youngs an abandon three eighth mile high bank asphalt oval track with a 6,000-square foot garage and two mobile home for $ 700,000 accord to levy county property record
i buy a speedway they give me the key and i go oh what do i do
now?'â she say
ten day after buy the track the youngs hold a meet and greet for area resident and driver
a group of them curious to meet the new owner turn up
we have a pretty good opening day young say but it be downhill after that
more than two year later the racetrack have make no money
ann young have have to dip into her family 's saving to make repair secure permit update license and sometimes pay the driver purse
some racetrack staff member and volunteer have move on to other job or leave because of disagreement with management about personnel and rule change the detail of which they air on online discussion board
some of the misstep have be self inflict when a couple of car show for one sportsman class race young cut the purse in half anger the driver
it be a mistake i would never make again she admit add what that guy cost me on the internet be what i do not pay on the purse
bring in fan have be young 's steep challenge but she be not alone
there be 1,396 register racetrack in the united states and canada accord to the national speedway directory
the attendance drop off at small town track have be attribute to more entertainment option televise race and high fuel price accord to interview with more than a dozen racetrack owner and promoter
but what have stay the same at these small track be the personal connection that owner driver and staff member have to the sport
small town racing run deep than money
it be often tie to family
a lot of people who be buy the racetrack they typically have some type of involvement in the industry say tim frost the publisher of the national speedway directory

they race as a kid or they have a parent involve in the industry

long before he bring people into his laboratory at columbia university to smoke crack cocaine carl hart saw its effect firsthand
grow up in poverty he watch relative become crack addict live in squalor and steal from their mother
childhood friend end up in prison and morgue
those addict seem enslave by crack like the laboratory rat that could not stop press the lever for cocaine even as they be starve to death
the cocaine be provide such powerful dopamine stimulation to the brain 's reward center that the addict could not resist take another hit
at least that be how it look to dr. hart when he start his research career in the 1990
like other scientist he hop to find a neurological cure to addiction some mechanism for block that dopamine activity in the brain so that people would not succumb to the otherwise irresistible craving for cocaine heroin and other powerfully addictive drug
but then when he begin study addict he saw that drug be not so irresistible after all
eighty to 90 percent of people who use crack and methamphetamine do not get addicted say dr. hart an associate professor of psychology

and the small number who do become addicted be nothing like the popular caricature
dr. hart recruit addict by advertising in the village voice offer them a chance to make $ 950 while smoke crack make from pharmaceutical grade cocaine
most of the respondent like the addict he know grow up in miami be black man from low income neighborhood
to participate they have to live in a hospital ward for several week during the experiment
at the start of each day as researcher watch behind a one way mirror a nurse would place a certain amount of crack in a pipe the dose vary daily and light it
while smoking the participant be blindfold so he could not see the size of that day 's dose
then after that sample of crack to start the day each participant would be offer more opportunity during the day to smoke the same dose of crack
but each time the offer be make the participant could also opt for a different reward that they could collect when they eventually leave the hospital
sometimes the reward be $ 5 in cash and sometimes it be a $ 5 voucher for merchandise at a store
when the dose of crack be fairly high the subject would typically choose to keep smoke crack during the day
but when the dose be small he be more likely to pass it up for the $ 5 in cash or voucher
they do not fit the caricature of the drug addict who can not stop once he get a taste dr. hart say
when they be give an alternative to crack they make rational economic decision
when methamphetamine replace crack as the great drug scourge in the united states dr. hart bring meth addict into his laboratory for similar experiment and the result show similarly rational decision
he also find that when he raise the alternative reward to $ 20 every single addict of meth and crack alike choose the cash
they know they would not receive it until the experiment end week later but they be still willing to pass up an immediate high
these finding make dr. hart rethink what he would see grow up as he relate in his new book high price
it ' a fascinating combination of memoir and social science wrench scene of deprivation and violence accompany by calm analysis of historical data and laboratory result
he tell horrifying story his mother attack with a hammer his father douse with a potful of boil syrup but then he look for the statistically significant trend
yes he note some child be abandon by crack addict parent but many family in his neighborhood be tear apart before crack include his own
he be raise largely by his grandmother
yes his cousin become destitute crack addict live in a shed but they would drop out of school and have be unemployed long before crack come along
there seem to be at least as many if not more case in which illicit drug play little or no role than be there situation in which their pharmacological effect seem to matter write dr. hart now 46
crack and meth may be especially troublesome in some poor neighborhood and rural area but not because the drug themselves be so potent 1 2 next page

the turkish government say monday that one of its fighter plane shoot down a syrian military helicopter that have fly into turkish airspace a potentially significant escalation of tension between the neighbor and former allies now bitterly divide over syria 's civil war
an f-16 warplane intercept a russian build mi-17 helicopter as it cross turkey 's southern border turkish official say
the helicopter 's crew be repeatedly warn by radio and do not turn back they say
when the helicopter have stray roughly a mile across the border the jet fire on it the official say and it crash to the ground in syria
no one from now on will dare to violate turkish border in any way the turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu tell reporter in paris on monday evening accord to the semiofficial anatolian news agency
the syrian army confirm that it have lose a helicopter that it say be on a reconnaissance mission and have mistakenly cross into turkish territory
the syrian army command denounce turkey 's reaction as hasty and say it be evidence of what it call the real intention of erdogan 's government towards syria which be seek escalation at the border of the two country the syrian state news agency report
the military action seem to amplify the turkish government 's increase call for a more muscular international response to the civil war in syria
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan of turkey be one of the first world leader to call for the overthrow of president bashar al assad of syria and he have strongly back the syrian rebel
in recent week mr. erdogan have call for a broad military intervention that would destabilize mr. assad 's government and force him from power a position that have put the prime minister at odds with the turkish public which oppose any military role in the crisis
mr. erdogan have also react coolly to a plan by the united states and russia to destroy or remove syria 's chemical weapon say it would buy mr. assad more time
mr. davutoglu say monday that the agreement do not serve as an end to the syrian crisis which he warn could escalate further even without chemical weapon
until monday turkey have largely refrain from unilateral military action against mr. assad 's force even after syria shoot down a turkish warplane in june 2012 and after stray shell from syria kill five civilian in a turkish border village
nor do the government retaliate in may after it blame turkish citizen back by syrian intelligence agency for twin car bombing that kill score of people in the turkish border town of reyhanli
turkey have shore up its defense along its 550-mile long border with syria include by deploy patriot missile battery
the parliament revise the military 's rule of engagement last year to allow the army to retaliate against syrian attack
turkish official frame the downing of the helicopter on monday as a defensive action that come after repeated warning rather than the kind of aggressive attack on mr. assad 's air force that the syrian rebel have be press their international allies to conduct
the turkish military say it have begin track the syrian helicopter at 1:41 p.m. when the aircraft be 26 nautical mile from the border and that warning have be repeat until it be about five mile away
official release radar tracking that show what the military say be the path of the helicopter hug the border in syria 's idlib province for a time before cross into turkish territory near the town of yayladagi
the helicopter crash less than a mile inside syrian territory
on monday in ankara deputy prime minister bulent arinc say there be no information on the fate of the helicopter 's crew
rebel activist in syria assert on monday that a syrian warplane have be shoot down
rebel group quote by the anatolian news agency say that rebel fighter have shoot down a syrian air force mig-21
it be not possible to determine whether the rebel and turkish official be refer to separate episode
videos post by rebel activist show image of a fireball in the sky and what appear to be someone with a parachute drift toward the ground
one rebel fighter say he saw member of a jihadist brigade capture and behead a crew member
the fighter provide an image purport to show the sever head of the slay syrian airman but neither his account nor the picture 's authenticity could be independently confirm

move from iphoto to aperture q. i would like to do more fine tune on my digital picture than the current version of iphoto allow
i be interested in the aperture software apple also make but how hard would it be to import my exist collection into aperture
a.
if you be run the most recent version of apple 's iphoto 11 it should be easy to move image to aperture a more advanced program
the two program use a unified picture library format
with the late version of aperture you can open your iphoto library without have to export and then re import picture
certain iphoto tool also work between the two program like the places and faces feature customize album and picture share with social medium site
one thing you can not do however be have a photo library open in both program at the same time
apple have more on use iphoto and aperture together at support.apple.com/kb/ht5260

marin cilic of croatia a former top-10 tennis player have be suspend nine month for a doping violation
cilic test positive for nikethamide a stimulant at the bmw open in munich in may.
the international tennis federation say monday that it accept cilic 's contention that he ingest the substance inadvertently in glucose tablet and be not try to cheat
as a result the i.t.f. give him a reduced penalty rather than a ban of up to two year
the suspension be retroactive to may 1 so cilic 24 can return to competition jan. 31
he will be ineligible for the australian open
cilic say he plan to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport
he say in a statement that he buy the tablet at a pharmacy in france
i wish to emphasize that i have never knowingly or deliberately take any banned substance in my life and that i be opposed to any use of performance enhance substance in sport cilic say
he have not play since withdraw from his second round match at wimbledon in june cite a knee injury
the i.t.f. statement refer to cilic 's accept a voluntary provisional suspension
he be rank as high as no 9 in early 2010 after reach the semifinal of the australian open
he be rank no
11 at the time of his fail test but he be currently 24th
cilic will lose all of his result rank point and prize money since the munich tournament
his best result in that time be a runner up finish to andy murray at the queen 's club grass court tournament in london
cilic 's suspension be the second doping relate penalty hand out to a former top 50 player this summer

49 be suspend for 18 month for refuse to provide a blood sample at the monte carlo masters in april
troicki be also appeal his suspension
kabul afghanistan an unpublished united nations report on female police officer in afghanistan find account of pervasive sexual violence and harassment by their male colleague accord to afghan and western official familiar with the report
the report which the united nations have circulate only among senior afghan official at the interior ministry find that about 90 percent of the policewoman interview describe sexual harassment and sexual violence as a serious problem and that about 70 percent of the policewoman say that they have personally experience sexual harassment or sexual violence themselves accord to people who saw the report or have it describe to them
while a much small fraction report either be rap or otherwise sexually assault the overall picture be of a police force in which woman be constantly at risk
although the report have not be make public and be not make available to the new york times two other recent report touch on similar problem though they do not focus as closely on the issue of sexual assault and harassment
ghulam mujtaba patang who step down as interior minister in august describe the united nations report 's broad outline but question its finding
he say that after read the report he send a team to investigate the situation of female police officer and that none of the woman his team speak to complain of such mistreatment
if an afghan policewoman be be rap or sexually harass they would report that they would not keep it secret he say
the chief spokesman for the interior ministry seddiq seddiqi say he think the report have some exaggeration of the issue and the problem
both man insist however that the ministry be commit to improve the situation of policewoman
the report accord to two people familiar with it survey nearly 10 percent of the female police force
united nations official would not discuss its detail
we be work with the ministry on follow up to the report and to put in place improvement say georgette gagnon the united nations director of human right for afghanistan
few subject be as taboo in afghanistan as sexual behavior and female victim of sexual attack be often accuse of immorality shun and sometimes jail
woman 's right advocate say that because afghan policewoman be afraid of be penalize for reveal the problem it be extremely difficult to get them to talk about abuse
that be all the more true if the person commit the sexual abuse be their commander or one of his close friend on the police force
the policewoman interview by the times say they fear be fire or demote or be send to work in a job that be far away from their home if they complain
most policewoman be low level security screener at checkpoint or government building and in many instance they be the only person earn money in the family and desperately need their salary usually around $ 240 per month
a further disincentive to talk publicly about sexual abuse or coercion be that many afghans already believe female police officer have loose moral simply because they be willing to work in public with man who be not relative
if a woman admit that she be under pressure to have sex conservative relative may force her to quit or even kill her to expiate the perceive dishonor to the family
general patang say he have visit policewoman in all of the province and have never hear a complaint about sexual abuse
most mention discontent with salary or a lack of promotion he say
i think the reason they tell these thing to the u.n. and do not mention it to my inquiry be that these be mainly illiterate woman who think they may gain more attention and support by make these claim he say
the situation for female police officer be make more difficult because there be so few of them barely 1 percent of the roughly 155,000-member force 1 2 next page
from biology class to c.s.i. we be tell again and again that our genome be at the heart of our identity
read the sequence in the chromosome of a single cell and learn everything about a person 's genetic information or as 23andme a prominent genetic testing company say on its web site
the more you know about your dna the more you know about yourself
but scientist be discover that to a surprising degree we contain genetic multitude
not long ago researcher have think it be rare for the cell in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way
but scientist be find that it ' quite common for an individual to have multiple genome
some people for example have group of cell with mutation that be not find in the rest of the body
some have genome that come from other people
there have be whisper in the matrix about this for year even decade but only in a very hypothetical sense say alexander urban a geneticist at stanford university
even three year ago suggest that there be widespread genetic variation in a single body would have be meet with skepticism he say
you would have just run against the wall
but a series of recent paper by dr. urban and others have demonstrate that those whisper be not just hypothetical
the variation in the genome find in a single person be too large to be ignore
we now know it ' there dr. urban say
now we 're map this new continent
dr. james r. lupski a lead expert on the human genome at baylor college of medicine write in a recent review in the journal science that the existence of multiple genome in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine
it ' change the way i think he say in an interview
scientist be find link from multiple genome to certain rare disease and now they 're begin to investigate genetic variation to shed light on more common disorder
science 's change view be also raise question about how forensic scientist should use dna evidence to identify people
it ' also pose challenge for genetic counselor who can not assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the dna throughout a person 's body
human blueprint
when an egg and sperm combine their dna the genome they produce contain all the necessary information for build a new human
as the egg divide to form an embryo it produce new copy of that original genome
for decade geneticist have explore how an embryo can use the instruction in a single genome to develop muscle nerve and the many other part of the human body
they also use sequencing to understand genetic variation that can raise the risk of certain disease
genetic counselor can look at the result of genetic screening to help patient and their family cope with these disease alter their diet for example if they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme
the cost of sequence an entire genome have fall so drastically in the past 20 year now a few thousand dollar down from an estimate $ 3 billion for the public private partnership that sequence the first human genome that doctor be begin to sequence the entire genome of some patient
sequence can be do in as little as 50 hour
and they 're identify link between mutation and disease that have never be see before
yet all these powerful test be base on the assumption that inside our body a genome be a genome be a genome
scientist believe that they could look at the genome from cell take in a cheek swab and be able to learn about the genome of cell in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body
in the mid-1900 scientist begin to get clue that this be not always true
in 1953 for example a british woman donate a pint of blood
it turn out that some of her blood be type o and some be type a.
the scientist who study her conclude that she have acquire some of her blood from her twin brother in the womb include his genome in his blood cell
chimerism as such condition come to be know seem for many year to be a rarity
but it can be common than we realize say dr. linda randolph a pediatrician at children 's hospital in los angeles who be an author of a review of chimerism publish in the american journal of medical genetics in july
twin can end up with a mixed supply of blood when they get nutrient in the womb through the same set of blood vessel
in other case two fertilize egg may fuse together
these so call embryonic chimera may go through life blissfully unaware of their origin
one woman discover she be a chimera as late as age 52
in need of a kidney transplant she be test so that she may find a match
the result indicate that she be not the mother of two of her three biological child
it turn out that she have originate from two genome
one genome give rise to her blood and some of her egg other egg carry a separate genome
woman can also gain genome from their child
after a baby be bear it may leave some fetal cell behind in its mother 's body where they can travel to different organ and be absorb into those tissue

the premise of this tiresome new novel by the critically acclaimed author norman rush sound as if it have be lift straight from the big chill a group of now middle aged college friend reunite to commemorate the death of one of their own
the result not only lack that movie 's humor and groovy soundtrack but be also an eye rollingly awful read
the novel 's preening self absorb character natter on endlessly about themselves in exchange that sound more like outtake from a dolorous group therapy session than like real conversation among longtime friend
its title subtle body which refer to people 's true interior self whatever that mean be a perfect predictor of the novel 's solipsistic tone
reader give to write comment in their book be likely to find themselves repeatedly scrawl word like narcissistic ridiculous irritate and pretentious in the margin
there have always be a strain of self consciousness in mr. rush 's writing but in his earlier book set in botswana where mr. rush once work in the peace corps the african setting provide him with an opportunity brilliantly seize in his debut collection of story white to exercise his reportorial eye and to place his character personal dilemma within the large context of westerners try to come to term with africa and its colonial past
with each book since whites that be the national book award win mating from 1991 and mortal 2003 his narrative and character have grow more inner direct a process that have reach its cloying culmination in subtle body
although most of this novel be set on an estate in the catskills shortly before the 2003 invasion of iraq it actually take place largely inside the head of a political activist name ned and his possessive wife nina who both it quickly become apparent live within the mylar bubble of their marriage obsessively dissect each other 's emotion and mood
ned think of nina as his honey monkey
nina think of ned as a sort of jesus a secular jesus
when ned and nina both wear jean she think of them as a symphony in denim
ned have rush from california to the catskills where his friend douglas have just die and nina have follow in hot pursuit because she ' ovulate now and want to have a child she ' furious that he ' pick this moment to get on an airplane without her
back in the 1970 we learn ned be part of a clique at new york university a band of student who as nina understand it think of themselves as a group of wit superior sensibility of some kind
they be the sort of folk who refer to themselves as cineastes because they go to movie at the thalia
they like to use word like outre refer to graffiti artist as ulterior decorator and say that pinot noir mean do not urinate at night
when they listen to record no one be allow to speak
douglas who seem to have drive a lawn mower too close to the edge of a ravine be the leader of the pack
reminiscent of the charismatic genius figure in iris murdoch novel he be an intellectual guru for the others though it ' baffle why anyone would look up to such a pompous jerk
douglas pick up his college girlfriend claire with the line
i stand here lonely as a turnstile and find it amusing to insert the word egad into every answer he give in a class
one of the group remember that douglas wish if we all outlive him we would go to some park and hide in the tree and when somebody come by we would shout great pan be dead.'â this jokester attitude infect douglas 's child rearing as well
he name his son hume after the philosopher david hume and encourage him to be as outrageous as possible
hume have grow up to be a feral teenager with a double mohawk haircut he often live off by himself in the wood in a cabin or a yurt
the medium be arrive to cover the memorial service for douglas because he be half famous in the world for debunk forgery he 'd prove that some sensational paper reveal that alfred dreyfus be in fact guilty of espionage be right wing forgery and have shoot down forgery of milan kundera 's so call love diaries.'â there ' a lot of mumbo jumbo about douglas 's philosophy it ' say that he be propose various universal solution to the problem of the persistence of evil in the world in human relation and more portentous gibberish about his current mysterious work nina say she ' learn that he take something call special commission
which mean that he do work for the german bundes something and for the israelis
the other member of this novel 's cast be either as insufferable as douglas or as flimsy as paper doll mannequin
there ' elliot an officious stockbroker who make risky and risky bet in the market and seem to have lose a lot of his friend money
there ' gruen a chubby fellow who own an agency that make public service announcement for tv and who use to serve as everybody 's confessor
and there ' joris who go to prostitute for sex because he regard himself as a married woman fetishist who would ruin any marriage he undertake the same way he ruin his first one he rarely see his two son from that union and say that maritime law be a perfect field for him because absolute cynicism be the best weltanschauung to have if you be in it because the field be strew with pirate and crook
perhaps mr. rush mean all this to read as black comedy but it ' not remotely funny or compelling
in fact it ' impossible to work up any interest in hear what these absurdly self important and poorly draw character may have to say as they drone on about themselves with some random aside about islam dadaism anti semitism and abstract matter like the sublime of deeply comprehend the world
at one point ned say to nina why be we even talk about this
it ' a question the reader may well ask about this claustrophobic and totally annoying novel
to the editor re learning what work sept. 3 while bring more student to stem field be important it can not and should not be the major goal
all student benefit from learn science especially science as process rather than rote memorization
understand and employ the critical thinking skill involve in the scientific method can help inform anyone 's life
furthermore we be all consumer of science
we use medicine we vote for legislator who decide which scientific endeavor get government funding
we face issue like climate change antibiotic resistance and genetically modify organism
do not all of us deserve to really understand what we be debate
jennifer zinman glen ridge n.j. to the editor i heartily agree with salman khan 's desire to position creativity and invention as the focus of stem course
to begin to address how we can do this there be several critical success factor to consider
the most important of these be failure since it be critical to figure thing out about the natural world or to create a new design
repeatedly reiterate the process use while make small change approach the problem from multiple perspective or work backwards from the desire outcome these be example of strategy that we use in a wide variety of context include stem exploration
our assessment of student need to reward thoughtful detour and dead end if we want to encourage a culture of creativity and innovation in stem classroom

mgmt mgmt columbia
something ' always loom and buzz or burbling or clattering or tap or ratchet or blipping or quavering near the foreground throughout mgmt 's third album mgmt. it make the album both testing and eventually reward
andrew vanwyngarden and ben goldwasser who write and record as mgmt have embrace excess since mgmt 's 2007 debut album oracular spectacular
their lyric be ornately elusive their arrangement deploy a neo psychedelic profusion of instrument and many of their song pack in multiple episode
mgmt trim back those tendency enough to start their major label career with three single from oracular spectacular that push forward drumbeat and keyboard hook to hint at 1970 pop in time to pretend
electric feel and the two million sell kid
but mgmt 's second album congratulation in 2010 spurn pop mechanic reach back to the most baroque confection of 1960 pop yield no hit
behind the disco ball gleam of oracular spectacular be a fascination with youthful bravado and disillusionment the labyrinthine song of congratulation grapple and quarrel with commercial success
on mgmt mr. vanwyngarden and mr. goldwasser have even large ambition
they ponder purpose fate and mortality in song like mystery disease your life be a lie and i love you too death
the album 's keynote be borrow introspection a folk rock song from a 1968 album by a long island songwriter who call himself faine jade
it vow there ' a reason and i will someday find the plan
mgmt be less optimistic their song see grow malaise and the inevitability of loss and deterioration
which explain the sound
there ' still a late-1960s foundation to most song while mgmt make few digression from verse chorus bridge than on congratulation
but the music have turn less antiquarian
with the producer dave fridmann mgmt have pile on layer and loop of percussion electronics and effect an almost overwhelming welter of activity a meticulous clamor that well up and change throughout every track
it ' the entropy that sooner or later await us all

mr. moore too be inspire by what bubble out of daisy duke short
look like two little pig in a tow sack/ i be tell you right now baby you get back
so mr. moore be a bad boy
someone who not only have bring the genre low but who want to poison it with pop culture and hip hop reference
he be far more wily than that
off the beaten path be his third strong album each of which engage in a bait and switch cloak old school value with new school reference
he be in no way a dissenter merely someone who understand that old form can stand even strong with injection of new idea
without the vintage quaver in mr. moore 's voice
it ' heavy on
for some ol redneck reason or the thickness of the guitar in his arrangement these song would have other meaning
but mr. moore be solid in his conviction that country music of the 1970 the more accessible side of the outlaw year be worth preserve and that the true modern spirit of that sound be mindful of the rest of the world
he ' also capable of nonideological beauty old habits a duet with miranda lambert with echo of george jones and tammy wynette or
that ' how i know you love me about the taming of a difficult man write with elegance and complexity by justin weaver rodney clawson and chris tompkins
and he ' capable of play it safe too with this kind of town or country radio which embrace old trope without improve them
i do not care what you listen to how you wear your hair you can paint it blue/
hey it take all kind mr. moore sing on the album 's opener old back in the new school
but really mr. moore want it the other way around for the new to season the old
i do not mind some attitude a rebel heart/ hell i get one too he add but you still gotta walk the line
jon caramanica kenny garrett push the world away mack avenue
focus have never seem like a problem for the alto and soprano saxophonist kenny garrett who at 52 still possess the taut molten sound that make him a force nearly 30 year ago
but the title of his new album push the world away be mean to suggest a respite from daily distraction
judge by the clarity and intensity of the result mr. garrett have to do a lot of push
his choose path as a bandleader build on the mid-'60 terrain of the john coltrane quartet flagrantly ingeniously and there ' a typical amount of slash polyrhythm and modal expedition here
that may be a problem if mr. garrett 's current band with the pianist vernell brown the bassist corcoran holt the drummer mcclenty hunter and the percussionist rudy bird do not do this sort of thing imposingly well
so too do the colleague who sub in for part of the album like the pianist benito gonzalez and the drummer marcus baylor
as a composer mr. garrett be often quick to show his hand
hey chick be his nod to chick corea a longtime collaborator the next track be chucho 's mambo a tribute to the pianist chucho valdes
there ' also a springy calypso j'ouvert homage to sonny rollins and a churchly ballad with string brother brown for the pianist donald brown who help produce the album
work in that capacity mr. brown should have talk mr. garrett out of a smooth jazz cover of i say a little prayer
maybe it ' mean as a palate cleanser before the title track an odd metered incantation so literal minded that it incorporate actual chanting

sapporo japan
the road to japan 's energy future run through a cluster of low building in this city the large on the northern island of hokkaido
here work on their own and in collaboration with american scientist researcher be study sediment core contain methane hydrate icy construct of water molecule with the explosive ga methane trap within
hydrate contain sediment be find in large amount around the world both under the sea and to a less extent in permafrost
if they can be tap safely and economically they could be an abundant source of fuel especially for country like japan that have few energy reserve of their own
the japanese researcher work have already bear fruit in march the government announce that it have successfully produce methane from hydrate in sediment under the pacific ocean
the effort conduct from a drilling ship in the nankai trough about 100 mile east of osaka be the world 's first hydrate production test in deep water
but scientist say there be still much that be unknown about the unusual compound sometimes refer to as flammable ice and that the commercial production of ga from them be still far off
we need to know more about the physical property of hydrate themselves and of the sediment as well say hideo narita the director of the research laboratory part of the national institute of advanced industrial science and technology which be finance largely by the government
further research here and at lab around the world will help scientist better understand the environmental impact of hydrate production include the possible release of methane a potent greenhouse ga into the sea or atmosphere
there be also the potential for subsea landforms to become unstable when hydrate be remove
timothy s. collett a research geologist with the united states geological survey say that despite all the talk about their potential as an energy resource hydrate be largely still a scientific issue
the research pose special challenge because hydrate form under high pressure cause by the weight of all the seawater or rock above them and that pressure must be maintain when the sediment core be analyze
if it be not the hydrate within quickly dissociate into water and ga and the sediment look like chocolate mousse say carlos santamarina a professor at georgia tech

i've be involve in the television industry for 30 year and i have have to travel almost all of that time
in my last job i travel about 45 week out of the year and be sometimes go for three or four day
i think there be three phase to business travel
during the first phase you love it
i would get excited about every trip even if it be to some small city that be not all that glamorous
in the next phase you hate it
i be in this phase for quite a while
i be tired of the hassle of flying sleep in hotel and be away from home
in the third phase you realize you can not win so you just tolerate it
that ' where i be at right now
i be not go to make myself crazy if there ' a delay or cancellation but i be not love the whole idea of travel
most of my business trip involve go to convention and meet with everyone we do business with at cableready
i be anything but a quiet guy but i find myself not talk much on the plane or in the airport
year ago i be come back from a convention and almost all the passenger on the plane be involve in the television industry
it be a lot of fun
a woman sit next to me ask if we all know each other and i explain that a lot of the passenger attend the same television convention that i do
she then tell me she hat television and for three hour i have to listen to exactly why she hat tv. i ask her what she do for a living and she tell me she be a lawyer
i be too polite to have a conversation about why people may not like lawyer
i remember the very first time i be upgrade
i be a senior at central michigan university and a friend and i be head to the national association of broadcasters convention in las vegas
we be on our way to the airport but our car could not handle the snow
we finally get to the airport but our flight be cancel
i start talk to the airline clerk and tell her our tale of woe and she book us on the next flight out of detroit
we be even upgrade to first class
i think it be awesome and when the attendant come by to take our drink order i be in awe
i reach for my wallet and the attendant tell me quite firmly that first class passenger never pay for their drink
i think that be the cool thing ever
even though i just tolerate business travel some experience can make me love it again
in january of this year i have to go to a convention in miami
i fly into fort lauderdale and plan on rent a car and drive to miami
the original rental i get have some issue and when i take it back because of those problem i be offer an upgrade
i figure i would take the upgrade and when i saw what they give me i could not stop smile
it be a scream orange 2012 dodge challenger
i be in heaven
i even take the car down to biscayne bay since i have an extra day before i need to get home
i feel like a kid back in detroit drive that car which i guess prove that you can take the boy out of detroit but you can not take detroit out of the boy

do i actually just pay $ 55.58 for a simple omelet and coffee from room service at the anaheim hilton hotel in southern california last week
yes i do
it be very early my laptop be misbehave the clock be tick toward deadline i have not have dinner the night before
still that ' the first time i have experience buyer 's remorse over an omelet though it arrive quickly and be actually pretty good
any business trip have peak and valley so i think i would pass along some example from my most recent for a few day at the annual airline passenger experience trade show in anaheim with an add stop in los angeles
the airfare a cheap $ 231.80 round trip on american airlines between tucson and los angeles be a peak
so be my avis rental car a complimentary upgrade to a sporty volvo xc60 that cost $ 175.30 for a week include all those annoying tax and fee
but a valley also come with the car
the electronic dashboard interface the control for everything other than actually make the car go be baffling
as i drive i try to figure out unfathomable symbol and notice from brian 's iphone which for some reason flash on the dashboard screen whenever i try in vain to regulate the air conditioner to an elaborately design radio that resist my effort to change the channel
so the guy who pass me on the 105 tap his horn and wave to signal that my rear windshield wiper remain on even though it be a sunny day should know that hip hop music also be blast inside my car in maddening synchronization with the wiper that i could not turn off
once home incidentally i read that a j. d. power report in june say one of the top complaint of new car owner this year be incomprehensible high tech dashboard control design
speak of top complaint the airport security hassle always rank high
again there be a peak and a valley on my trip
the peak be the tucson airport where the transportation security administration screener be invariably courteous and friendly
the valley be reach on my return flight at los angeles international airport
thanks to my membership in global entry i have the covet precheck certification on my boarding pas for a fast pas through security
but as i stroll happily through the metal detector without have to remove my shoe or take out my laptop a glower t.s.a. screener block my advance and tell me basically not so fast buster
i have be randomly select to be swab down for explosive
hold your palm out the screener bark at me as she tug on rubber glove
how about you say please
i reply
this displease her mightily but after pass the no bomb trace on palm test i be allow to proceed
i later tell david castelveter a spokesman for the t.s.a. that while my encounter with screener be usually pleasant and professional this one bother me partly because it have cloud my first experience with precheck
i can not comment on the particular but the officer as part of their training be teach how to properly interact with customer
we hold them to a very high standard of customer interaction mr. castelveter say
the t.s.a. have other worry last week to be sure
the night before i later read a former t.s.a. agent be arrest on charge of make unspecified threat against the airport in an eight page letter title the end of america the end of satan
that same agent accord to the los angeles times have earlier resign after report that he have humiliate a 15-year old girl at the airport in june for what he call her inappropriate attire
peaks and valley
the night before my return home i have a peak stay at the four points by sheraton los angeles airport a good midlevel hotel close by the airport where i have manage to score a nightly rate of $ 98.75 tax and fee include through the priceline name your own price blind bidding service
when i get home i realize that i have leave a single brown dress shoe behind in my room
i phone the hotel and speak with a friendly housekeeping manager juana ortiz who say i have your shoe and will send it to you
then alas i spend an hour online and on the phone with fedex try to update the expired american express platinum card number on my account
my old card have be hack during a previous trip and i need my fedex account updated so that ms. ortiz could send the shoe
i do not yet know whether that work because my fedex account wo not let me see my detail without approval from the administrator who happen to be me
as to the brown shoe that i stupidly forget one way or another i be confident that ms. ortiz will get it back to me
which will be another peak

it predict potash price would drop about 25 percent to $ 300 a ton from around $ 400 a ton when it leave
the low price would hurt russia but they would hurt belarus more
though uralkali deny any direct link this action come after year of effort by mr. putin and the kremlin to compel belarus to sell strategic asset like oil refinery and natural ga pipeline in exchange for subsidized energy supply
mr. lukashenko first agree to sell a stake in belaruskali though the potash mine provide about 10 percent of the state tax revenue but then balk
he say it be still for sale but cite an exorbitantly high price anger the russian oligarch who have be vie for it and set the stage for the breakup of the fertilizer cartel that follow
the belarussian government retaliate with what appear to be a trap the belarussian prime minister invite the chief executive of uralkali vladislav baumgertner to his country for talk on aug. 26 and then arrest him at the airport
uralkali 's chairman aleksandr voloshin and a part owner suleyman kerimov have also be invite but only mr. baumgertner show up
it be unclear whether the others stay clear of belarus because they have sense a trap or whether their schedule simply do not have room for the country 's prime minister which be the formal explanation both official offer
mr. baumgertner be charge with abuse of power which carry a potential 10-year sentence
belarus state television show his glum perp walk past the water stain concrete wall of a prison nickname the american girl lead by a chubby guard in a camouflage uniform
belaruskali which be state own have no public relation office
the switchboard refer call to anatoly v. makhlai whose title be deputy director for ideology and cadre who decline to comment
later the belarussian authorities issue arrest warrant for four other executive and mr. kerimov the part owner
analyst say mr. baumgertner be not likely to serve hard time but be instead be hold as a hostage to compel the russians to rejoin the cartel
outraged the russians respond with a flurry of trade restriction ban all belarussian pork import ostensibly over newly discover health concern
it look like the conflict be escalate boris krasnojenov a mining analyst at renaissance capital an investment bank base in moscow confirm in an interview
farmer and fertilizer company be watch closely
share in the potash corporation of saskatchewan rise earlier this week after sign of a reconciliation
report indicate mr. kerimov would sell his stake to another russian oligarch more palatable to president lukashenko or to the nickel mining company norilsk lead to a patch up of tie and re creation of the price fix cartel
but norilsk say on wednesday that it have no plan to buy a stake
share in potash corporation fall again
even by the standard of business practice in the former soviet union these tactic appear blunt
this move be absolutely aggressive and abnormal mr. krasnojenov say refer to the arrest of mr. baumgertner
the prime minister invite the c.e.o. of a major company to a meeting and then arrest him
the dispute have hurt profit of both uralkali and its former belarussian partner belaruskali and be wonderful for farmer from idaho to india who have already benefit from low fertilizer price
potash be one of three main plant nutrient along with phosphate and nitrogen and be use widely to increase corn and soybean yield
the price for granular potash in the midwest have fall to around $ 400 a ton from $ 420 before the announcement on july 30

optimist say that every cloud have a silver lining ed lotterman a columnist for the idaho statesman write of the wobble cartel
it be not hard to find one in the recent potash industry upheaval that send the stock of several fertilizer producer down by a fourth
what be bad for them be great news for u.s. farmer
power chord and pizzicato
cha cha and chamber music
funk and free jazz
klezmer and cacophony
all of those and many more turn up during a marathon of john zorn 's masada work at the n.y.u. skirball center on sunday
in four and a half hour of music by 13 ensemble and soloist the concert celebrate mr. zorn 's 60th birthday which be sept. 2
he have be mark the occasion with concert around the world that have reaffirm his astonishing productivity and multifarious connection
mr. zorn be sample and mash up idiom long before computer make it easy he be also well before the internet set up improbable but fruitful network of musician and idea
the concert draw on a fraction of mr. zorn 's masada repertory two set of melody the first 200 of them from the 1990s and another 316 tune he write in three month in 2004
nearly all of the program come from the second group the book of angels
the masada piece be base in klezmer with its modal scale odd meter and zigzag melody
and like klezmer itself a fusion of what jewish musician bring with them and pick up in travel through eastern europe and then america the tune be flexible
they be brittle perpetual motion jazz in uri caine 's piano solo blister psychedelic jam power by bass riff pluck on a moroccan gimbri in the hand of abraxas and sleek bachelor pad music as play by bar kokhba
krakauer set david krakauer 's clarinet wail over funk vamp
mycale a four woman a cappella group turn them into intricate ingenious glow pan mediterranean song
much of mr. zorn 's music revolve around the idea of genre investigate how they 're recognize how they connect or contrast how far they can be stretch how they can be juxtapose or intercut
he approach genre as a connoisseur a strategist a trickster and sometimes a vandal if a genre be see as a set of rule he may play by them toy with them or tear them apart
behind the musical element be the association of genre with era place and people his music pull free of them
erik friedlander turn masada tune into impassioned cello solo recall the technique of bach suite
malphas the duo of mark feldman on violin and sylvie courvoisier on piano play them as splinter chamber music a series of brief precise suddenly contrast passage last only a few second each
the roberto rodriguez octeto masada mingle klezmer with latin charanga and invite the audience to dance
the masada string trio give its tune a hint of gypsy music
dreamer cast the melody as smoothly shimmer jazz
cyro baptista 's banquet of the spirit charge into one melody as a kind of middle eastern surf rock and secret chiefs 3 crank its tune up to burly jazz rock with klezmer violin interlude
electric masada with mr. zorn on alto saxophone have the last set and it be a gleeful eventful one move amid hurtle electric jazz eerie laptop electronics and squall of percussion and dissonance cue on the spot by mr. zorn
and all through the marathon a paradox persist
with all the transformation and idiom the masada tune hold on to some klezmer identity one stubborn genre indeed

it seem obvious that a comedy about a mother and daughter team of recover addict would be harder edge than one about meddle elderly father who wo not pick up a check
actually mom which begin next monday on cbs be for some reason both witty and sweet than the new fox show dad which have its premiere on tuesday
it ' not the casting although mom have a slight edge with allison janney as bonnie and anna faris as her daughter christy
but still dad have its share of experienced comic actor include martin mull as the father of warner giovanni ribisi and peter riegert as the father of eli seth green
mostly it ' the sensibility behind the writing
chuck lorre a creator of mom be know among other thing for two and a half men and the big bang theory
those hit comedy ostensibly revolve around immature man but they be even more distinctive for their funny uncommon female character notably amy on big bang play by mayim bialik
dad have many executive producer include seth macfarlane a creator of family guy
it turn out that the willfully sophomoric politically incorrect humor that work in an animated series do not sound as amusing when come out of the mouth of flesh and blood actor
there be some funny line but not nearly enough
material that be mean to be anarchic mostly come across as obvious and boorish
mom be more genuinely provocative
bonnie be an irrepressibly cheery and unapologetic former addict who can not understand why her grow daughter be still so resentful
i 've watch you lick cocaine crumb out of a shag carpet christy say
bonnie reply primly it ' not a sin to be thrifty dear
it help that cable have already lay the groundwork for the flawed mother figure
show like the sopranos and break bad give rise to the era of so call difficult man but cable have also radically loosen the restriction on heroine
homemaker be rule breaker from the suburban pot dealer on weeds to the substance abuse title character of nurse jackie
it use to be that sitcom character complain that their mom be crazy because she have too many hat on the united states of tara toni collette play a wife and mother with multiple personality
mom behave badly be not a new thing but on a prime time show it still feel a little transgressive
man who act like boy on the other hand be so familiar that they 're almost retro
and that make dad a harder sell
eli and warner best friend since childhood have a thriving video game business aid by a small team of employee and mostly impede by their clueless interfere father
the character be caricature and the joke be often unpleasant
eli be whiny and unprepossessing yet he have a revolving door of attractive woman eager to be his girlfriend
when a pretty aspirant arrive for a party she perkily say you must be warner as he open the door
yeah do not learn my name it ' easy that way warner reply
the pilot of dad cause a bit of a stir about stereotype and some advocacy group be particularly offend when the chinese american employee veronica brenda song be instruct by eli and warner to dress up as a sailor moon like anime character to soften up chinese investor
veronica supposedly brainy tough and confident complies
mostly the show suffer from a more diffuse lack of imagination all the woman wife co worker and even clean lady be castrate scold with little sense of humor
eli and warner be man boy and their father be gomer boy
mom which focus on woman in recovery have a get straight message which may merely be a reflection of mr. lorre 's rather sobering experience deal with charlie sheen at the height of that actor 's substance infuse public meltdown
like many show today dad be far more cavalier about marijuana use
in the second episode warner and veronica put eli through an intervention to persuade him to go back on pot because they think he be more creative when he ' stone
the dad end up consume the pot laced brownie hilarity do not ensue
mom deal lightly with the serious problem of addiction and manage to be clever not sanctimonious
dad take a minor problem annoy parent and make it deadly

kafkaesque be not a word normally use to describe immune response but it ' how dr. louis j. picker describe what his experimental vaccine do to his rhesus monkey it ' like their t cell be turn into the east german secret police hunt down infected cell until there be none leave
recent work by dr. picker a vaccine expert at oregon health science university have shake up the long frustrating search for an aids vaccine
his late study publish in nature last week have scientist scratch their head wonder if it may open up a new avenue for research
dr. picker test his vaccine in 16 monkey who be then infect with simian immunodeficiency virus a close relative of h.i.v. which normally would have send them spiral rapidly down to a miserable death
the experimental vaccine protect only nine of them but it also do something never see before these monkey slowly clear the virus and now appear to be cure
three year later you can not tell them from other monkey dr. picker say
dr. anthony s. fauci the head of the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases say the effect be unique
and dr. barton f. haynes the director of the human vaccine institute at duke university 's medical school say it be potentially extremely important to understand how this happen
scientist often test idea for potential aids vaccine by create similar one against s.i.v. never before have one eliminate an exist infection
in that sense the effect of dr. picker 's vaccine be less like that of a measles or flu shot and more like that of the aids cure use in two famous case know as the berlin patient and the mississippi baby
the berlin patient timothy ray brown be infect with h.i.v. and cure only by obliterate his immune system to defeat his leukemia and then inject bone marrow from a donor with a rare h.i.v.-block mutation
the unidentified baby be bear to an infected mother in mississippi and apparently infect with h.i.v. but then cure with early and large dos of antiretroviral drug
both now appear to have no h.i.v. lurk deep in their body but it be impossible to be sure because not every bit of their tissue can be test
because he work with monkey dr. picker be able to do something that would be unthinkable with human patient necropsy them grind up every organ and take 240 sample from each to be sure that they harbor no hidden virus
make vaccine by simply weaken the virus that cause aids have fail because the virus mutate a hundred time faster than even the fast mutate flu virus
in dr. picker 's vaccine s.i.v. gene be fuse to those of another virus the cytomegalovirus
the name mean big cell and it be in the herpes family but different from its relative that cause lip and genital sore chickenpox and shingle
h.i.v. fusion have be try with adenovirus and others but cytomegalovirus seem to work better
it ' not entirely clear why but one theory be that cytomegalovirus have a very long history of infect primate so much so that 100 percent of monkey and about 80 percent of human get it in their lifetime
therefore we primate have adapt to it
although the virus can be lethal to fetus and to those with immune system suppress by aids or transplant drug in most victim it cause no symptom
the body respond to cytomegalovirus more slowly and calmly than it do for example to a flu
as in any infection the thymus gland generate new white blood cell call t cell in this case cd8 hunter killer cell prim to target the specific virus
but in the case of dr. picker 's vaccine those cell stay in an unusual half alert state
a full blown immune response eventually exhaust itself and can even be dangerous
for example the rare human who catch h5n1 bird flu often die of the immune response itself they drown in the flood of cd8s and other would be savior pour into the lung tissue spoil for a fight
that half alert state be the kafkaesque element unactivated cd8s wander around aimlessly while fully activate one behave like storm trooper
but the half activate cd8s persist in tissue eliminate their target quietly without trigger inflammation or even a mild fever
when s.i.v. gene be fuse to the cytomegalovirus spine the cd8s kill s.i.v.-infected cell too
since it protect only some monkey the new technique may be best use in combination approach
for example dr. fauci say it could be give with a vaccine that generate antibody against h.i.v. and maybe eliminate the cell that sneak past the antibody shield
alternatively the vaccine may be give to infected patient who be on antiretroviral drug to see if it can mop up linger reservoir of virus
it should take up to three year to get a human version ready for trial dr. picker estimate
now the outstanding question be why only half?'â say dr. mike mccune an aids researcher at the university of california san francisco refer to the monkey who be protect in dr. picker 's trial
too often aids advance that work in lot of monkey do not work in many human
not all monkey be the same dr. mccune say
they 're not as inbred as mouse but they 're sometimes from the same family they get the same diet
who know what will happen if this go into human
washington factory output surge in august as the pace of motor vehicle production jump to a six year high a hopeful sign for the economy after a slow start to the third quarter
although another report on monday show a slight slowdown in factory activity in new york state this month new order and shipment in the state rise all point to an increase in manufacturing after weaken in the spring
growth in the manufacturing sector be pick up and will run faster over the balance of the year than have be the case in recent month say john ryding chief economist at rdq economics
manufacture production advance 0.7 percent the federal reserve say
the increase help to lift overall industrial production by 0.4 percent in august
factory output have lag solid gain in the institute for supply management 's index of manufacture activity
the sharp recovery in the i.s.m. since may follow now by this surge in manufacturing output be encouraging sign that the spring soft patch in factory activity be over say ted wieseman an economist at morgan stanley
in a separate report the federal reserve bank of new york say its empire state general business condition index slip to 6.29 in september from 8.24 last month
a reading above zero indicate expansion
even as activity in new york state slow business be confident about the future
the survey 's index of six month business condition approach a one and a half year high in september a good sign for business spending
the improvement in industrial output last month point to some underlie momentum in factory activity which support economist forecast of only a mild slowdown in economic growth this quarter
this momentum be likely to encourage the federal reserve to begin wind down its economic stimulus when its policy maker meet on tuesday and wednesday to assess the economy 's health
the economy continue to expand at enough of a pace where we be create job and help to bring down the unemployment rate say gus faucher senior economist at the pnc financial services group
i would not be surprised to see an announcement on wednesday that the fed will begin reduce its $ 85 billion a month in purchase of treasury and mortgage back security
gain in manufacture output last month be lead by a 5.2 percent rebound in auto production which have slump 4.5 percent in july
it be the large increase since november and it take auto production to an 11.25 million unit annual rate the high since june 2007
there be also increase in the production of consumer good high tech equipment machinery aerospace and electrical equipment and appliance
utility output fall for a fifth consecutive month in august a decline economist attribute to a relatively cool summer and difficulty adjust the series for seasonal fluctuation
the amount of industrial capacity in use creep up to 77.8 percent from 77.6 percent in july
capacity use which can indicate how much factory can increase production before economic growth become inflationary be still 2.4 percentage point below its long run average
there be no evidence of any inflation pressure at this point in the production cycle say joseph lavorgna chief economist at deutsche bank

andy samberg and andre braugher man child and man 's man make their debut as sitcom lead in fox 's new cop comedy brooklyn nine nine on tuesday night
that the show be not nearly as distinctive as its two star be a disappointment but in a way it ' also a virtue
mild affable and familiar brooklyn nine nine be a show the whole family can snicker at
and there ' something to be say for that in a season when most of the other new sitcom be self conscious star vehicle the crazy ones the michael j. fox show portrait of family dysfunction mom the millers or salute to unchecked testosterone dad we be man
in that context a loose jokey workplace comedy look like a relief
the throwback feel of brooklyn nine nine be build into the premise
it belong to a narrow genre the squad room sitcom whose most notable example remain the 1970s classic barney miller
and the relationship between mr. samberg 's detective jake peralta and mr. braugher 's capt
ray holt stem from an even old and more celebrated show they 're a modern manscaped version of hawkeye pierce and colonel potter in m*a*s*h.
not that you want to think about that comparison for more than a second
like pierce peralta be both anti establishment and supercompetent he organize fire extinguisher race and refuse to wear a tie but he ' also we 're tell the best detective in the precinct
unlike pierce he do not have a serious edge or an excuse artillery fire incessant carnage for his manic immaturity beyond be the central character in a 21st century sitcom
and despite its fond association brooklyn nine nine create by dan goor and michael schur who be writer and producer on parks and recreation be thoroughly contemporary in its sketch comedy style structure emphasize throwaway joke physical humor and visual punch line like an amusing mod squad reference while avoid anything resemble story development
crime be solve in the pilot episode but you wo not remember who do what or why
you will remember that andy samberg tie a tie around his waist and wear a psychedelic speedo and that deli meat and cheese be throw lead someone to yell that ' a waste of manchego and that andre braugher say it ' over disco man put down the yo yo and back away from the girl in his voice of god baritone
whether brooklyn nine nine will be consistently humorous enough to warrant attention be debatable from the pilot it ' not great
that the hoary he ' right behind me be not he
gag be use several time or that the funny thing in the episode be a nearly silent 26-second cameo by fred armisen
it should continue to score well in likability though
mr. braugher show that deadpan humor be a solid component of his formidable arsenal and mr. samberg be charming and nicely self efface
in the support cast of cop joe lo truglio and stephanie beatriz stand out as the well mean klutz and the scary tough cookie
like parks and recreation or even barney miller brooklyn nine nine could just possibly grow into something great than the sum of its quirk

mrs. clandon be the very model of an independent 21st century woman
too bad she live at the turn of the 20th century
to the shock of victorian society mrs. clandon robin leslie brown abruptly flee her unhappy marriage in england for the lush exotica of a portuguese island
there she create a new life for herself and her three child by write twentieth century treatises a best sell series of manifesto on parenting cooking conduct clothing and of course gender relation which her carefully indoctrinate offspring frequently quote back to her
that ' the back story for george bernard shaw 's you never can tell a subversive comedy of error about man and woman 's negotiation over independence and marriage
when the play open the clandon clan have return home to england after 18 year of island living
the young child twin play by emma wisniewski and ben charles a voluble and perfectly synced tweedledee and tweedledum soon unknowingly invite their father to a family lunch
but while the estranged spouse quarrel a reluctant romance blossom between the eldest clandon child a frequently flush amelia pedlow and a penniless dentist sean mcnall neither of whom be prepare for sentimentality 's steel trap grip on their scientifically hone mind
for better or for bad their abrasive overly intellectualized courtship translate easily to today 's battle of the sex
but much of what be so revolutionary and outrageous about shaw 's plot twist and inversion of victorian more be lose in this production direct by david staller
in particular the scene transition in which the twin waltz around the stage and blow some sort of fairy dust upon various light fixture feel like force whimsy
touch like this and other strained physical comedy gum up the pacing and blunt the sharp social commentary that mr. staller celebrate in the program note
while this pearl theater company revival may not deliver the sociopolitical punch that shaw intend it be still brighten by some strong performance particularly those of dan daily as a wizened waiter and zachary spicer as his son a smug barrister who have embarrass his servant class father by rise above his social status
it ' be a long time since i have see a play as brutal as carcass
it may be even longer before i can scrub its residue from my mind
severe and unrelentingly grim the piece be often difficult to watch several audience member flinch during its most vicious moment
yet carcass be also tough to look away from especially in this cunning production that intensify every angry scene
write around 1905 by peretz hirshbein the story center on an embittered family lead by avrush its alcoholic patriarch
mend'l his slow witted son seethe over his own misfortune and unrequited love while reyz'l avrush 's stepdaughter dream of better day

the dialogue be steep in threaten language and violent imagery
spit in her face mend'l demand that reyz'l do to her mother
i hope you die a painful death he rag at his own who be ill
this expressionistic staging direct by paul takacs add to the menace the set by steven c. kemp be stark and claustrophobic the sound design by jeremy s. bloom eerie and pervasive
color be wash out and shadow creep into every corner the lighting be by dante olivia smith
it ' no surprise that the program feature a work by egon schiele
as avrush david greenspan 's bile seep into every sentence
he ' an oily defeatist wallow in misery
alvin keith 's mend'l be a caged beat creature sometimes attack those around him sometimes shy away
mr. keith be a fearsome involved actor
rebekah levin 's reyz'l smoothly alternate between innocence and anxiety
thomas preece kathryn rossetter and robyn kerr round out the cast of six none of whom shrink from their character fury

the large agency hold group in advertising be seek to revive its small agency network
the holding group wpp base in london want to bolster a collection of agency know as the united network form in 2006 from an agency network call red cell united
to that end matt ryan who most recently hold senior post at havas worldwide new york be join the united network as its global chief executive base in new york to serve as a partner to ewen cameron the longtime chairman of the united network
the goal of the united network originally introduce under the name the voluntary united group of creative agencies be to offer marketer an alternative more creatively focused resource that be small than the four global agency network also own by wpp grey jwt ogilvy mather worldwide and y&r.
the idea behind a small agency network be that it can be more nimble and its principal can pay more attention to each client
also not every marketer need a giant agency with score of office around the world staff by phalanx of executive
part of our armory at wpp be to have network with various structure and various appeal martin sorrell chief executive of wpp say in a phone interview from beijing add there ' a segment of the market where client want small network micro network mini network
it make sense for us to have a network like this
the united network have counterpart at the other agency hold group
among them bartle bogle hegarty at the publicis groupe and lowe partners at the interpublic group of companies
there be also a number of mini network that be independent not part of a hold group among them gyro m&c saatchi and wieden kennedy
the eight office that make up the united network be in london madrid milan new york oslo paris seattle and antwerp belgium
they work for blue chip marketer like astrazeneca capital one coca cola ikea procter gamble red bull visa and vodafone
but the united network may be too small even for a network mean not to be big
accord to the trade publication advertising age the united network 's revenue last year total $ 80 million compare with $ 105 million at gyro $ 202 million at bartle bogle hegarty and $ 305 million at lowe partners
they be good individual agency good at what they do on an individual basis mr. sorrell say of the united network office which include berlin cameron united in new york and cole weber united in seattle
the next step he add be pull the network together in a more cohesive way
in june mr. ryan 52 leave havas worldwide new york part of the havas worldwide division of havas where he have be co chairman as well as president for global brand
his departure come after andrew benett the new global president of havas worldwide take on add duty as chief executive of the new york office
before havas worldwide new york mr. ryan lead help lead or hold senior post at agency that include change technology partners quintacom ryan drossman partners and ryan partners
the first thing i would say be that hire matt be a commitment by wpp and me to the idea of build united into what we want it to be from the beginning say mr. cameron 49 acknowledge that the united network have be off the radar for a while

two reason for that low profile mr. cameron say be a focus on grow the client we have and work with the wpp team process on project
his reference be to network dedicate to specific wpp client like team detroit for ford motor and red fuse for colgate palmolive
such collaboration keep the agency viable mr. cameron say but the problem with that strategy be that it create anonymity
to be a viable micro network i need a partner he add
i 'm better with partnership than on my own i be a planner by trade not a c.e.o. mr. cameron 's last partner andy berlin retire in 2008
mr. cameron say he be attract to mr. ryan 's experience in build global brand build agency
mr. ryan say he believe that the united network could use agency in the asia pacific eastern europe and latin america region although he add it would be a big move if we go to 12 or 15 office in total
ask for a time frame for revitalize the united network mr. ryan suggest it would be 12 18 24 month before big return would be obvious
mr. sorrell ask the same question reply as feasibly as possible and as quickly as possible
mr. cameron say he begin discussion with mr. sorrell to bring in a partner about six month ago well before the announcement in late july that wpp would be displace as the world 's large agency hold group by a merger of the omnicom group and the publicis groupe
mr. sorrell also say the effort to revive the united network be independent of and unrelated to the merger which may be complete by next spring

washington on friday senator jeff merkley an oregon democrat try to phone denis mcdonough the white house chief of staff with some bad news as many as five democrat on the senate banking committee be no vote for lawrence h. summers the white house 's favor candidate for the position of chairman of the federal reserve
mr. merkley have patchy cellphone reception at the pendleton round up a rodeo in eastern oregon
mr. mcdonough be deal with other business and could not be reach so senator merkley leave a message with his staff
that spotty phone call reflect the revolt of a number of prominent democrats many of them from the liberal wing of the party but not limited to it help to seal mr. summers 's fate
not even an official nominee yet mr. summers a former treasury secretary under president bill clinton and a key architect of mr. obama 's economic stimulus program face long odds in win senate confirmation
on sunday mr. summers pull out of contention cite a potentially acrimonious battle that could harm the economy and mr. obama 's presidency
senate democrats do not want the fight say one congressional aide speak on condition of anonymity
they do not want another fight that divide democrats and bring back to the forefront a bunch of the issue we deal with during the crisis and the bailout
the aide continue and they do not want to spend the political capital to get this guy through
ultimately they get their way
in its search for a new fed chairman the white house have for month center on mr. summers who smart after be pass over for the position when mr. obama decide four year ago to name ben s. bernanke to a second term as chairman
this time with mr. obama determine to replace mr. bernanke after eight year in office the white house have weigh other candidate include janet l. yellen the fed 's vice chairwoman and donald l. kohn a former fed official
but many top economic policy official in the administration consider mr. summers who work intimately with them during the financial crisis by far the best candidate
the white house assign rob nabors a deputy chief of staff to work with him and recruit two former campaign consultant jim messina and stephanie cutter to talk him up to the press
but a number of senate democrats rather than wait for the nomination process to play itself out raise concern as soon as his name surface this summer his reputation for be a divisive colleague his perceive role in coddle wall street and the lax regulation of derivative and complaint that he do not support small community bank as much as the nation 's giant financial institution among other issue
in july those senator strongly signal to the white house that they prefer ms. yellen
senator sherrod brown of ohio draft and circulate a letter of support for her which 20 colleague sign include richard j. durbin of illinois the no 2 democrat
it be not a subtle maneuver one aide say
a diffuse group of democratic senator oppose to mr. summers 's nomination may not have scuttle it
but the lawmaker be concentrate on the banking committee where fed candidate must win a majority vote before they can go for a full senate confirmation
the senator and staff member on the committee bat around the pro and con of mr. summers for week at time air their concern with a white house that some official describe as receptive and some as dismissive
after return from the long congressional summer recess mr. merkley make an attempt to parse out his colleague position on mr. summers during caucus lunch
he find that as many as four be oppose to or queasy about the potential nomination
mr. merkley and mr. brown be strong no vote
senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts have misgiving and prefer ms. yellen though her colleague be not sure how she would vote in committee
in time two more senator admit their concern
jon tester of montana decide he would oppose mr. summers
and heidi heitkamp of north dakota express some misgiving about mr. summers a senate aide confirm though those concern be never air in public
the senate banking committee consist of 12 democrats and 10 republicans
every democrat in the no column would have to be balance with a yes vote from a republican to win the support of the committee
by mr. merkley 's count mr. summers may have need as many as five republican vote
for the white house that would have leave two option senate aide say both unpalatable
the first would have be to lean on the democratic no vote ask member to agree to pass mr. summers out of committee even if they intend to vote against him on the senate floor
but the white house have not lay the groundwork for such a strategy
some democratic office have not hear from white house representative about the nomination at all
the second option would have be to barter for republican vote
aide describe that strategy as possible many republicans would have be willing to vote for mr. summers they say for a price
but hand the republicans leverage in the midst of the debt ceiling and budget debate would have weaken the white house 's hand
white house adviser include mr. mcdonough and valerie jarrett be oppose to any such trade offs
mr. summers with his own well hone political antenna pick up the signal from washington
ms. yellen have again become the presumptive front runner as she have be for much of the spring
senate democrats for their part have make their thought on her know
despite lukewarm republican support she would almost certainly sail out of committee and clear a full senate confirmation vote too
i do not think it ' any secret that larry be not my first choice senator warren say in an interview on msnbc on monday

alfred n.y. it be just about the time they be go to turn off the water that this village recognize it may have a college problem
for year resident have live in symbiosis alongside two school the private alfred university and alfred state college a part of the state university of new york system
the school capitalize on alfred 's small town charm the single stoplight the deer wander in the street while the village enjoy thousand of student eat drink and spend at local establishment an annual rush of revenue and revelry that arrive as autumn do
but clean up after those student be less appealing and make all the more difficult because the college as nonprofit tax exempt entity be under no legal requirement to pay anything for public service
a former tile manufacturing town in western new york alfred have a shockingly skinny tax base a whop 90 percent of its assess value be estimate to be tax exempt
so last year to try to cover its cost the village tell the school they would have to pay more for their water
suny balk
and that be when the village make a quiet but firm ultimatum
pay up or go thirsty
it get their attention say virginia rasmussen a village board member
and we get the check
with increase financial pressure on municipality across the country as well as on place of high learning town versus gown squabble over pilot payment an acronym for payment in lieu of tax be increasingly common and often contentious
in july gov. lincoln chafee of rhode island sign a bill require bryant university to negotiate a payment for service with its hometown smithfield
pilot fight have also get testy in pittsburgh where the city and the university of pittsburgh medical center have sue each other over the center 's tax exempt status and in princeton n.j. where the approval of a $ 300 million art center for princeton university be dog by question over how much the ivy league institution should pay into local coffer
such dispute usually involve major institution and the city that host them
it be rare for a battle to break out in a tiny spot like alfred despite financial strain that can be acute
it be a perennial problem in these community say peter baynes the executive director of the new york conference of mayors which have argue unsuccessfully for change in state law to allow local government to require payment from tax exempt entity
and certainly while they would not want to trade those school there be this fiscal recognition that while 100 percent to the community be receive the service only a fraction of the community be pay
tax free policy have also be in the spotlight in new york
in june gov. andrew m. cuomo sign a new law allow suny branch and some private college to offer tax free zone for new business that open on or adjacent to their campus
while official in village like alfred and other upstate college town like the idea of more job the idea of more tax free property be less appealing
you 're take more stuff off the table say justin grigg the mayor of alfred and a professor at alfred university
and it ' a pretty small table already
and it be not just in his town he add
this be not just an alfred problem mayor grigg say
this be a statewide problem
he mention mr. cuomo 's plan in a letter send to alfred state and alfred university in june ask each to voluntarily pay $ 75,000 this year for public service say we be concerned about tax free campus be wrap by tax free business
but the governor 's office say locality do not need to worry about lose income under the new law because business that open on property adjacent to tax free school will not be automatically take off the local tax roll although their employee will be exempt from state tax
in many way alfred be much more college than village
the full time taxpaying resident population be only about 1,000 many of whom work at or make a living through business from the college
during the academic year some 6,000 student descend on the village study on the hillside campus and play in the village 's clutch of bar restaurant and requisite pizza place 1 2 next page
east rutherford n.j. there be an excess of negative statistic to cull from the giants 41 23 loss to the denver broncos on sunday but there be one measurement view with a twist that is more illustrative than any other
the giants be 1 for 11 in third down conversion
that be a staggering lapse but in truth the problem be not third down it ' first and second down
the giants be average 2.2 yard a carry and only 36.5 rush yard a game
the inability to run the football be destroy every tenet upon which the giants offense be build
an effective run game on first and second down not only put the giants in attainable third down situation it allow eli manning to make credible play action fake in the backfield a necessity for downfield pass
in a quiet giants locker room manning say in effect on monday that oppose team be unaffected by his play fake
the giants be waste time try them
before the snap the defense have already align itself to play the pas and ignore the feeble running attack
if you 're not run the ball well they can keep the safety very deep manning say
it ' not really a play action situation
and when the giants get nowhere on the ground on first and second down even a top level quarterback like manning become overmatched by the defense 's strategic advantage
we have four third down where it be third and-13 or more manning say
those be hard to convert
the giants be also in two third and-8 a third and-9 two third and-10 and a third and-11
there be nothing inside football about this
it ' elementary
but what should worry every giants fan be whether there be anything the team can do about it before next season
the new start run back david wilson have yet to show he can run between the tackle
the backup be brandon jacobs who run for 4 yard on seven carry sunday and now have 11 rush yard in 12 carry during his last two n.f.l. season
the third back be da'rel scott a second year player with promise but little experience
the rushing trouble be not the fault only of those hand the football
as coach tom coughlin say about the running game sunday we 're certainly not knock them back off the ball
an offensive line have often be liken to a clenched fist
because of injury the offensive line have not be together as a unit to deliver many punch
and there may be big concern than continuity
the preseason starter at right tackle david diehl be out with a thumb injury
center david baas and right guard chris snee be come off injury
right tackle justin pugh be a rookie
be a clenched fist even possible at this point
after watch videotape of sunday 's game leave guard kevin boothe say on monday that the blocking problem be not cause by breakdown up and down the line but by the failure of different individual at different time
we have a number of play where everything be go right
but we have a breakdown in one area he say
or as manning put it it ' not one guy mess up over and over and it ' not everybody mess up
but like anything else one breakdown can ruin everything
if the offensive line 's problem be not resolve soon where can the team turn
there be no seasoned veteran wait in reserve
diehl will return to the lineup but he struggle last season as well
and what of wilson the close thing to a savior at run back that the giants have
until andre brown come back from his broken leg in mid november and in retrospect brown 's absence have be devastating wilson be the only answer
but the 5-foot-9 205-pound wilson simply may not be a back in the classic giants mold
the offensive coordinator kevin gilbride may have to find way on first and second down to get wilson the ball in unconventional way to use his speed and quickness away from the congested middle of the line
you can find way to give him the ball and get him in the open field manning say
we may need to do that and use him somewhat differently
manning look hopeful but concerned as if he know what be at stake
the rest of the locker room be wait too
the running game be not do well defensive end justin tuck say
and i think that ' make eli press a little
the chemistry be not click right now
but i mean i have no doubt they will figure it out
the season probably rest on it
tokyo
each day before dawn the world 's large fish market come to life in frantic activity a last holdout of an old quainter japan
worker in rubber boot slosh through inch deep water while others dart by on motorize cart carry plastic foam box with every manner of creature that can be haul from the sea from dagger shape silver sardine and spider like crab to the deflate protoplasmic blob of mysterious deep sea predator
in one corner auctioneer loudly hawk the huge frozen torso of prize tuna lay in row on the floor
nearby fishmonger in open air stall carve the tuna flesh into ruby red brick for sale to sushi bar and grocer
soon it will be go
the city be plan to spend $ 4.5 billion to relocate the market nickname tsukiji for the neighborhood that surround it to a modern climate control distribution center on a manufacture island in three year
the move be part of a broad face lift tokyo be plan before the 2020 olympics
for the many who have oppose the change the relocation will bring not only the loss of a historic 78-year old marketplace but also another blow to a vanish way of life
tsukiji have be a place where merchant haggle face to face and where even the lowly fishmonger display the obsession with freshness that help japan bring sushi to the world
its passing be part of a broad transformation away from the tiny mom and pop shop specialize in everything from tofu to rice cake that have be increasingly replace by big box supermarket and fast food chain
official say they want to redevelop the market 's approximately 50 acre of land value in the billion of dollar into high rise apartment building and a tunnel that would connect tokyo to the island that will house new olympic site
they and many who work at the market also say the move be necessary to keep up with changing time as the same fast food chain and supermarket that have change tokyo 's urban landscape have increasingly shun tsukiji as too expensive and slow
opponent counter that the relocation be yet another example of the skewed priority of japan 's development happy bureaucrat who they say want to tear down what have become one of the city 's most popular tourist destination to enrich big construction company and real estate developer
tsukiji be the beat heart of the sushi culture that spread across the world say kazuki kosaka a former local assembly member who oppose the relocation

and now it will be redevelop into condominium
when move tsukiji be first propose 14 year ago it spur widespread opposition even lead to rare street protest
they be lead by so call middle wholesaler the traditional middleman who buy from big wholesaler and sell to restaurant and other retailer they fear the new market would allow large corporate wholesaler to squeeze them out
in 2001 the plan appear doom after the discovery of toxic contaminant at the new site which have house a refinery for convert coal into natural ga
but city official be undeterred chip away at opposition by offer subsidy to help pay for the move
last year the union represent the middle wholesaler who number about 700 switch its position and come out in favor of the move which be consider a do deal bar some last minute reprieve
after delay tokyo say it be on track to complete the yearlong cleanup of the new site by march
worker there now spend their day scrap off several foot of contaminate topsoil to replace it with clean dirt
but critic fret that the cleanup will not convince skeptic that seafood whose value lie partly in its pristineness be safe
the tokyo government be use the olympics as an excuse to distract people from the contamination issue say makoto nozue 76 who have buy and sell tuna at the market for six decade
tsukiji be a globally known brand name and a cultural treasure
why throw this away

ephrata pa. they may be the most pampered chicken on the planet
on certain day a truck pull up alongside their quiet spacious coop on an amish farm here and deliver a feast that seem tailor to a flock of two legged aristocrat
before long the rust color bird be peck away at vegetable peeling and day old bread from some of manhattan 's most elegant restaurant like per se daniel gramercy tavern the modern and david burke townhouse
it be all part of an experiment that be bring together elite chef preindustrial farming practice and a breed of french poultry that be rarely find in the united states
the goal to see whether american restaurant can turn back the culinary clock and rediscover what a chicken should taste like say ariane daguin the pioneering businesswoman who be behind the idea
can scrap from acclaimed restaurant where the best ingredient be use create the table to farm to table chicken of the future and the past
new york diner will get to nibble on the result this week
after have be fatten up in pennsylvania about 220 of what the d'artagnan company be call green circle chicken will start show up usually roasted on dinner plate at the same restaurant that help fee them
for high end chef who engage in a perpetual contest to track down the pure and most rarefied ingredient it be a tantalizing prospect
when i taste it i be like whoa,'â say jean georges vongerichten who plan to start incorporate the chicken into his ever evolve menu
witness say that after his first bite mr. vongerichten be on the verge of tear daniel humm the chef at eleven madison park consume an entire chicken in one sitting
still a few raise eyebrow be to be expect
the image of chicken gorge on four star ingredient can seem a rather operatic manifestation of today 's obsession over food
i do think in some way it ' a wonderful reaction to corporate poultry and corporate farming in general say matthew mills a creator of fodder a satirical online show from the cooking channel
but at the same time it swing so far to the other side that it ' almost an onion headline
he cite a well know episode of portlandia in which two diner aggressively interrogate a waiter about the provenance of a chicken
clark wolf a prominent restaurant consultant agree
on one side it sound kind of wonderful and magical and on the other side it sound like the big stunt i have ever hear he say

i mean you know let them eat zucchini
ms. daguin the french bear founder and chief executive of d'artagnan a company that have play a major role in bring ingredient like foie gras game bird and berkshire pork into the broad american marketplace say that it be not a stunt but part of a continue mission to change the world by change its palate
ms. daguin 55 recall move to greenwich conn. from france in 1977 to work as an au pair and get her first bite of mass produce american chicken
it be a crime she say
for ms. daguin as for gallic chef like mr. vongerichten and daniel boulud a distaste for chicken that be mushy and full of water as she put it be intensify by nostalgic memory of chicken back home that wander around the yard nibble on carrot top onion skin and old baguette and end up taste rich and meaty with an almost chewy texture
what would happen she wonder if you take a heritage breed chicken in this case one common to gascony the region of southwestern france where she grow up and feed it scrap from fine restaurant
for chef like michael anthony at gramercy tavern there be a philosophical appeal in find us for those scrap and in support a fresh but old school alternative to factory farming
we know the horror of the cage bird mr. anthony say
ultimately it come down to taste
in restaurant circle a chicken that taste like chicken be something of a holy grail
about half a dozen chef have sign up so far though the roster of restaurant be still in flux
when ms. daguin approach mr. boulud with her proposal he grasp it instantly have grow up with similarly pastoral experience
for me it be not a foreign idea he say
he contribute scrap from his restaurant as the food supply for a test run
of course these chicken be not din on stale loaf from grandmother 's breadbox
on a recent afternoon at the farm where a few hundred creature inhabit a peaceful 15,000-square foot coop that would dwarf the size of most new york apartment they cluck and amble around pan of bread soak in fresh milk and white bucket full of leafy trimming that would make a tremendous tossed salad
some of this be nice stuff than i have to eat when i get home say mike charles a local poultry expert involve in the project 1 2 next page

the national institutes of health work group be mean to focus specifically on how the federal agency should spend its $ 40 million brain initiative budget in 2014

mayor michael r. bloomberg the school chancellor dennis m. walcott and senior education official take a victory lap of sort on monday visit 22 new york city public school that rank among the state 's top 25 in reading and math exam give last spring
the performance on the new exam which be some of the first nationwide to be align with a more rigorous set of standard know as the common core offer mr. bloomberg a chance to boast about his education record as his 12-year run as mayor come to a close
our administration 's core philosophy when it come to education have always be if we raise our expectation our kid will meet them mr. bloomberg say at talented and gifted young scholars a citywide gifted school in east harlem that be one of the 22 high scoring school
the mayoral blitz carry out with militaristic precision come as the two man campaign to lead the city in the post bloomberg era have be offer a stark contrast on educational issue
the democratic nominee bill de blasio favor undo much of the bloomberg administration 's centerpiece educational policy by slow the growth of charter school and end for at least a year the practice of close low perform school
the republican candidate joseph j. lhota have defend the mayor 's record on education and want to expand the number of charter school
mr. walcott have warn in recent month that school would be in peril if the next mayor reverse mr. bloomberg 's policy
but mr. bloomberg have decide not to endorse anyone in the race and on monday sidestep any discussion about his successor
all i know be what we have do say mr. bloomberg who list some of the fact he deem creditworthy include the achievement of student the increase desire of family to be a part of the school system and the city 's ability to attract the best and the bright teacher from around the country
less than one third of new york city 's student pass the reading and math test this year as score drop in virtually every school in the state
on the whole city student outperform those in other large district in the state and the city 's pass rate nearly match the state 's even though the city have many student who be poor or not native english speaker
we have be close the gap with the state for a few year now and that just have not happen to the best of my knowledge in any other state where there be a lot of big city mr. bloomberg say
but gap in achievement between black and hispanic student and their counterpart have continue to persist
and many of the 22 school that the mayor showcased on monday be in well to do neighborhood or be highly selective in their admission include the anderson school no 1 in the state new explorations into science technology and math or nest+m no 4 the brooklyn school of inquiry no 18 and tag young scholars no 20
official however note that seven of the school on the list be open after mr. bloomberg take office in 2002 include three that hew to the administration 's goal of give poor student more choice the active learning elementary school in queens and two success academy charter school in the bronx
batting away any criticism that most of the city 's student could not score high enough to be consider proficient in english or math he say be we where we want to be
no
and incidentally we will never be where we want to be
this concept of proficiency be i have always think so misleading

when it come to make money twitter be all about keep it simple
there be no banner ad no dancing animation no ad insert between screen that you must click to get past
virtually all of the company 's revenue which be project to be nearly $ 600 million this year and $ 950 million next year come from three basic advertising format that blend smoothly into its core microblogging service whether user be access it from a mobile phone or a web browser
what they have be able to do very well be develop product that meet the need of most advertiser without be overly complex say debra aho williamson principal analyst for social medium at emarketer a research firm
but the simplicity of twitter 's product be also a weakness especially when compare with other social network like facebook
the company do not have concrete demographic information about individual user like gender and age to allow it to sell highly targeted ad at expensive rate
and its marketing effort have largely be orient toward large advertiser in the united states with few sale to small business and only about one fifth of its ad revenue come from overseas ms. williamson say
twitter which announce last week that it have file confidential paperwork to begin the process of sell stock in an initial public offering have disclose virtually no information about its finance
the company decline to comment for this article cite regulatory restriction surround its i.p.o.
but emarketer estimate that the company will bring in $ 583 million in revenue from advertise this year and $ 950 million in 2014
twitter also make additional revenue from sell the data in its raw feed of hundred of million of message daily
the most common type of twitter ad especially on mobile device be the promote tweet
essentially advertiser create a twitter message limit to 140 character like any other message on the service and pay to insert it into the flow of message that a user see base on certain trait like age gender or keywords that a person be interested in
so if you search for apple iphone on twitter the first message that be likely to appear be a pay ad from google 's motorola unit which be run a campaign proclaim the virtue of its android smartphones love to talk
moto x respond to your voice no touch necessary read one or from microsoft which be push its windows phone device watch how the 41-megapixel windowsphone nokia lumia 1020 make any seat the best seat in the house
both company be bid against each other to reach people interested in the iphone
in many way the result resemble the ad that pop up at the top of the page after a web search on google which also emphasize simplicity in its ad business
as with google twitter 's advertiser set key parameter like target audience and how much they want to spend and then computer program submit bid instantly to serve ad to available slot
advertiser pay only when someone interact with an ad such as by retweeting it to their follower comment on it or mark it as a favorite
that typically happen only 1 to 3 percent of the time
to get that rate on the high side twitter 's system do not just automatically award an ad slot to the high bidder instead it give an advantage to ad that previous viewer have find to be more relevant or engage
the holy grail for advertiser be an ad that be widely share by twitter user to their own follower
to increase the chance of go viral brand will often embed photo and video into their ad
twitter 's other ad format be even simple
the company 's list of trend topic the most popular 10 or so subject be discuss at any give moment on the service be well know as a window into society 's transient obsession
advertiser can pay a flat fee to buy their way onto the list
the price for such a promoted trend which be clearly label vary by country but run about $ 200,000 for 24 hour of exposure to every twitter user in the united states
company or people seek to build follower for their account can also pay to appear on the top of the list of new account to follow that twitter suggest to each user
as twitter prepare to sell stock to the public the company be plan initiative that will add complexity to its advertising business while also diversify its revenue stream
last week for example it announce that it have agree to acquire mopub a start up that act as a middleman in place ad from marketer inside mobile application
mopub do something quite different from twitter auction off two billion ad slot a day in apps like songza and opentable through dozen of ad network and deliver the ad so quickly that a user fire up the app barely notice
but jim payne chief executive of mopub say the two company share a common dna.
like mopub he say twitter be design to be mobile and it be design to be real time
he say twitter have promise to let mopub continue build out its current business even as the two work together to improve the ad offering on twitter itself
ms. williamson the emarketer analyst say mopub could become a significant source of revenue for twitter
mopub 's technology will streamline their self serve platform she say
it give twitter entree into the real time bidding business the ad network business mobile app ad
through its amplify program twitter be also aggressively promote joint ad sale with television channel
espn for example can show game clip on twitter that be sponsor by an advertiser with twitter and the channel sharing revenue

washington janet l. yellen tell friend in recent week that she do not expect to be nominate as the next chairman of the federal reserve
although she have be the fed 's vice chairman since 2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job president obama 's aide make clear throughout the summer that he want lawrence h. summers his former chief economic adviser
now awkwardly it appear that the president may have to circle back to ms. yellen after mr. summers withdraw from consideration on sunday bow to the determined opposition of at least five senate democrats
on monday ms. yellen become the front runner by elimination official close to the white house say
supporter of mr. summers include many of the president 's close adviser have raise some concern about ms. yellen in recent month
perhaps most potently they say that institution benefit from fresh leadership and argue that ms. yellen 's crucial role in create the fed 's current policy could inhibit her ability to make necessary change
some presidential adviser also argue that mr. summers bring crisis management experience and a work knowledge of financial market that ms. yellen lack although so do ben s. bernanke when president george w. bush select him as chairman
there have be tension between ms. yellen and daniel tarullo a fed governor with close tie to the president 's economic team who have take a leading role on issue of regulatory policy
ms. yellen also clash with gene b. sperling head of the national economic council when both be adviser to president bill clinton in the 1990
nonetheless the president 's adviser insist throughout the summer that mr. obama be not averse to ms. yellen but simply more comfortable with mr. summers a former treasury secretary to president clinton who be mr. obama 's chief white house economic adviser through the height of the financial crisis and recession in 2009 and 2010
in those year he form a bond with mr. obama and others in the white house despite a tendency toward arrogance
stock market soar on monday on the withdrawal of mr. summers
many investor regard him as less commit to the fed 's monetary stimulus campaign than ms. yellen
in trading the dow be up 118 point and interest rate down in a show of increase confidence that the fed would withdraw more slowly from its effort to stimulate the economy include bond purchase
ms. yellen 's supporter wait with a mixture of elation and apprehension for the president 's next step
janet yellen i hope will make a terrific federal reserve chair senator elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat who be one of those warn the white house against a summers nomination say on msnbc. the president will make his decision but i hope that happen
administration official and supporter acknowledge that the president would enrage his party 's base if he be now to reject ms. yellen and forfeit the chance to name the first woman to the most influential economic job in the world
on the other hand with no obvious alternative the choice of ms. yellen which month ago may have be celebrate as historic be likely to be see as mr. obama 's reluctant capitulation to his party 's left wing
that prospect and mr. obama 's distaste for be pressure into some action could prompt him to consider other candidate several former administration official say
the president have already interview donald l. kohn a former fed vice chairman before ms. yellen get the job in 2010 on mr. obama 's nomination
for year mr. kohn be among the most influential adviser to former fed chairman alan greenspan and thus would have draw criticism from democrats many of whom blame the greenspan fed for an antiregulatory stance that encourage financial excess that lead to crisis 1 2 next page

the douglases usually bill in tandem as jack douglas and reiko be also ubiquitous on the show of merv griffin david frost mike douglas and dick cavett and on the johnny carson incarnation of the tonight show
ms. douglas whose english the show business columnist dorothy kilgallen write in 1960 be actually far better than it appear capitalize handily on american parochialism of the day
in her first appearance on mr. paar 's show she take the stage alongside her husband in traditional japanese attire
her heavily accent nearly incomprehensible reply to mr. paar 's question cause much hilarity among the audience
but far from be helplessly adrift in an anglophone sea ms. douglas be by many account in considerable control of the situation her girlish charm and unassuming speech help disarm a xenophobic public only a decade and a half after the end of world war ii. reiko hashimoto be bear on sept. 2 1936 in kanazawa japan
she perform in japan as a dancer singer and comedian before move to the united states in 1955

munich it be election season in germany and angela merkel the chancellor be live through her bad nightmare
the allegedly most powerful female politician on the planet hat campaign politics
ms. merkel should be confident and upbeat
she have manage the euro crisis quite well the currency have not collapse and germans be do fine economically
she lead in the poll by a strong margin and enjoy remarkable approval rating despite be in office for eight year
there be almost no chance of her lose her post when voter go to the poll on sunday
still something smell foul and ms. merkel be grip by that wariness that usually befall her when thing be go too well
and this time she may be on to something be the woman who have succeed through an iron commitment to consensus and harmony too bore for germany
ms. merkel have never be good on the stump
she be elect chancellor twice but for her election evoke a sense of trauma
she almost lose to gerhard schrã¶der in 2005 despite a comfortable lead in the poll
four year later despite strong poll number she again do bad than expect on election day though her position be secure by her strong coalition partner the free democrats
when it come to election ms. merkel really be a bad politician
she have never manage to relax and show confidence on the campaign trail
in her only tv debate with her main challenger peer steinbrã¼ck of the left lean social democrats she seem distant and passive
on the stump she only recently go into attack mode and shy back again immediately
on syria she try to offer support for america 's effort against the use of chemical weapon while also heed the german public 's aversion to military action only to find herself vulnerable to criticism that she would either follow president obama blindly or leave him in the lurch as she do in the libya crisis
she be not a fascinating speaker though in private she be highly engaging and even funny
she rarely make a bold move and even on minor issue she be cautious and think through the possible consequence over and over again
the paradox be that such weakness on the trail be strength in office
the chancellor 's signature mark be her deliberate argument drive boring clinical policy style
she take a problem cut it into piece and try to find a solution often heavily technical and always very detailed
during the height of the euro crisis this calm and deliberate style help her and though she have her critic she be arguably responsible for save the euro zone
so why be she such a coward in the campaign
why be she not cash in and invest some of the political capital she have amass
because ms. merkel can not beat her bad enemy herself
ms. merkel be the master of harmony the den mother of one of the world 's rich economy
but that style almost by definition prevent her from take the offensive during a campaign
and after eight year in office ms. merkel 's calm deliberative style may have run its course with german voter
she have basically suffocate most of her political opponent by absorb their position leave no oxygen for them to breathe
critic accuse her of suck all blood from the political life in germany a country that love consensus and be suspicious of too much fighting
people want to know what they have to expect over the next four year
they want to have a choice
they deserve more than a hint on how the most powerful country in europe finally want to overcome the crisis on the continent
ms. merkel know this but she wo not change
she dislike be compare to margaret thatcher but she subscribe to mrs. thatcher 's famous dictum the lady ' not for turn
this may come as a shock abroad where germany 's neighbor be wait for election day as if it be christmas
they want and expect to see germany live up to its potential as a world leader whether it be on economic or security matter
but there be no gift await no new more robust german foreign policy to emerge after the distraction of the election
no miracle will be perform on sunday
regardless of whether she dominate the election or just squeak by ms. merkel will govern in the same boring deliberate style as before
step by step crisis after crisis
to seal her legacy as a great chancellor ms. merkel must now reinvent herself and show more leadership both at home and abroad
she need to take a risk or two and even be prepared to lose
she could afford it but will she

our billionaire mayor have see his golden touch turn to dross of late and so he decide that he would not bestow his endorsement on a successor
it be think the mayor have just one target for his electoral affection the republican joseph j. lhota
but if legacy weigh on michael r. bloomberg he may have consider stroll over to the beaux arts manhattan municipal building knock on the public advocate 's door and offer his endorsement to bill de blasio
new york 's progressive choice may well have slip out the back door and clatter down the step to avoid that meeting
mr. de blasio have take great pain to frame himself as the anti bloomberg
but fact intrude
mayor bloomberg 's legacy be far more progressive than mr. de blasio and his supporter let on
and the mayor may one day find himself nod in grudge admiration as a de blasio administration work to deepen and extend some of his policy
from affordable housing to public health to child welfare to the creation of park land to rework the city 's streetscape mr. bloomberg have an impressive progressive policy legacy
he be a fierce guardian of our endanger watershed
on global warming his propose marshland and natural barrier and tough but fair construction standard be a sierra club daydream
park land edge the waterway and innovative playground be find opposite the metropolitan museum of art and at public school 181 at 1023 new york avenue in east flatbush and in the farthest reach of far rockaway
in his first term he raise tax to protect service
he give big raise to teacher
whatever one make of his education reform and i be often critical he build grand new school and try to crack open a calcified system
he be less a republican than a chameleon change affiliation from democrat to republican to independent as his electoral desire dictate
michael gecan and the industrial areas foundation a coalition of congregation and neighborhood battle this administration
but they also work with it to build a gleam school in mott haven in the bronx
and they build work class home in brooklyn across brownsville and east new york
george bush do not do that
or rick perry in texas mr. gecan note
those be not the action of a right winger
o.k. now that i have climb so far out on this branch as to risk a tumble let me inch back in
the mayor have be unyielding on stop and frisk policing tactic with their disproportionate effect on black and latino male
a mayor de blasio would retain the tactic as a tool but significant change loom
culturally the mayor remain a man of wall street which be to say a deep dyed capitalist
he do not spend much time contemplate his contradiction
he favor some government intervention outlaw smoking in bar and ban big urn of soda
but he talk as if others a few sick day for a pharmacy cashier
a living wage for a hard work janitor
threaten the foundation of this city
a mayor de blasio offer the possibility of new path walk
he may press in albany to raise the minimum wage
or he may reverse our conservancy drive tale of rich park poor park
chicago and seattle dedicate money for park be we so parochial as to think we have nothing to learn
mr. de blasio talk of pull on zone lever and push creatively to extend the city 's reach on affordable housing
if he do so he will lean heavily on the bloomberg administration 's creative financing program
nor be mr. lhota the wolf at the door of liberal fear
he be a new york republican which in national term be awfully close to an irredeemable liberal
recently he claim he could deliver a $ 500 million universal prekindergarten program without identify where he would get the money
how very john v. lindsay of him
mr. lhota and mr. de blasio finally may consider adopt a bloomberg trait
when face with complaint about his initiative mr. bloomberg have an admirable willingness to say feh
we will talk to you he suggest but we wo not stop forever if you disagree
would mayor lhota push business backer to swallow a high minimum wage
could mayor de blasio prevail upon the union for real concession
the other day mr. bloomberg say he want only to offer his successor a world class transition
what he may not realize be that even a liberal successor be likely to stand more in his shadow than either man may guess

new delhi they can not do without the farmer story
when people who wish to transform india through the internet talk about their plan they tend to tell a story that go something like this a poor farmer be about to sell his crop very cheap when someone often a smart adolescent granddaughter check the market price online and the farmer make a more informed decision
it appear that technology executive feel they must treat the internet as something deeply noble and serious in order to substantiate its importance in an impoverished nation
even facebook that great time suck of farmville not farmer seem to have suffer a head injury and be now imagine itself as mother teresa
internet.org the company 's recent push along with other company to bring affordable access to the more than two third of the world that be not yet online have the grave tone of social reformation
facebook 's founder mark zuckerberg say last month that the goal be to create a backbone for many thing include access to information access to information about health care education job and just so many good thing
too many people presume that what the poor want from the internet be the crucial necessity of life
in reality the enchantment of the internet be that it ' a lot of fun
and fun even in poor country be a profound human need
quality of life be as much an assortment of happy frivolity as it be the bare essential of survival
and india be a perpetual reminder that a lot of good even the somber sociological stuff can come from people set out in pursuit of joy
what the poor want from a technological revolution be probably best understand by watch the way they react to electricity
they do not crave electricity so they can keep newborn warm in incubator
they want it for the simple pleasure
chibaukhera a village in northern india where electricity have be available only since march of this year be now under the spell of television
as television set be much seek after and prestigious dowry several house have them even before they get electricity
now that the tv and plug have finally meet the villager be hook on hindi film and serial about family feud
in time they will have incubator too
it be not always true that entertainment be the collateral consequence of progress progress often be the collateral benefit of the pursuit of pleasure
so what be the problem if facebook and others have acquire a halo as they try to reach out to develop nation with false notion about what the poor actually want
after all they do plan to bring the internet to place that do not have access
but the tech industry 's misreading of the big audience in its own revolution will lure it into commit the same mistake of so many other altruistic project
the last 15 year have see numerous well intentioned mission to transform society through computer and the internet remember one laptop per child but few of them have have much impact
today of the roughly 207 million occupy rural home in india only about 1.2 million have computer with an internet connection
but there be 300 million cellphone subscription in these area
and accord to a recent survey more than seven million of those user connect to the internet only through their phone
the extraordinary triumph of the cellphone among india 's poor stem from its ability to enable a most mundane human need which be to chat with other people
and when the poor chat it be not always about cure a child of diarrhea
the indian government have several valiant plan to bring internet access to the village but they largely center on connect government office for id database and for software simulation to teach citizen skill like plumbing
would not it be better if the poor be offer direct connectivity over their phone free or cheap and be leave to decide what they want to do with it
mr. zuckerberg 's belief that connectivity be a human right be honorable
where he and his allies err be in imagine that fun be not and in underestimate the power of entertainment to transform society
chat with friend online may not save the world but if it can get more people to log on the rest will follow
many year ago when i work for a lifestyle magazine i be give my bad assignment ever

it be equally ridiculous to presume that what poor people want from the internet be lesson in plumbing

i be steer my cart through costco the other day wonder whether to waddle to the aisle where they sell cashew by the quarter ton or to the one with thousand piece pack of chicken thigh when an epiphany pierce the fog of my gluttony
actually two epiphany
the first
i need to have kid four or five or better yet a baker 's dozen
only then could i take full advantage of the saving around me
the second
costco as much as anything else be why the land of the free and the home of the brave be also the trough of the tub o lard our exceptionalism measurable by not only our g.d.p. but also our b.m.i.
that ' body mass index and our body be indeed massive
i do not blame costco per se
i blame what it represent an american obsession with size with quantity that manifest itself as surely in supermarket and restaurant as it do on our highway
we drive minivan and sport utility vehicle we rip into veritable feed bag of potato chip and wedge our steroidal thanksgiving turkey into refrigerator more capacious than some european car
this do not redound to our benefit
and while the notion that we weigh too much because we buy order and eat too much may be obvious it ' increasingly obscure
study after study and report upon report look at more particular reason for obesity and excess pound focus on the edge and the aggravator of the problem instead of the flabby core
and the number and variety of these investigation not to mention the prominent showcase we in the news medium give them create the impression that alchemy not appetite be our enemy and that if we could just fine tune our daily schedule rejigger our protein to carbohydrate ratio or wallow sufficiently in fiber all would be well
it ' as if we 're micro focus on less daunting and less damning culprit to distract ourselves from the one that ' most fearsome and difficult to change which be the sheer volume of food that many americans be accustomed to consume
in the times alone over the last six week i have read story or blog post about research that explore the effect of a proper breakfast on weight loss the implication of gut bacteria on a person 's tendency to be fat or thin the impact that sleep deprivation can have on dietary craving the possible utility of strenuous exercise as an appetite suppressant and the unhealthy food choice that a favorite sport team 's defeat can cause
the examination of how and why we overeat be like some full employment scheme for physician nutritionist scientist and professor who have look at the role of alcohol of additive of peer pressure of bribe
one book that land on my desk recently posit that pollution be make us fat and trace the parallel rise in air conditioning and obesity
but these expert have not bring us clarity
we have be tell that snack be good and that it ' not that fruit and veggie will save the day and that they wo n't that more exercise mean few pound and that it make no difference
what i have see with my own eye and can intuit with common sense be more consistent and persuasive
for a few year i live in italy where people be generally thin than in america and i learn that it ' not because they walk all that much more one popular theory or smoke away their hunger another
it ' because they do not celebrate huge serving the way that americans do and do not pig out as much as a result
the mcdonald 's near my office in rome do not supersize anything
i saw no roadside sign for all you can eat buffet
i never encounter a never end pasta bowl ã la the olive garden nor a denny's style grand slam

america be lousy with such vessel the big gulp the economy pack the party size two for one pizza deal the whopper the double whopper the triple whopper costco in all its bloated grandeur
they have teach us that volume equal value and establish a dangerous baseline for what we consider a sane amount of food

he want to live alone in a den like apartment work night on his thought or in a big rambling house without tenant and close to the hub of the city
he would like also not to live there but still to call it his home where he could drop in surprise himself hard at work in his study or have be call away find the place shriek his absence
he would like to live there and in the country as well unknown except for the ga meter reader who would fade in and fade out bimonthly
he once write a letter he think he would only half write himself which end limply how many empty like me be there leave to pick up before i die
now he believe the letter be write completely by someone else
of course he be wrong but what if he be completely somebody else

washington first come the supercommittee task in 2011 with find a bipartisan deficit reduction plan but doom to fail
then come the mcconnell plan a way for congress to raise the government 's debt limit without actually vote to do so
and in january there be no budget no pay a measure couple with the last debt ceiling increase to deny paycheck to lawmaker if they do not pass a budget
for three year congressional leader have rely on tactical maneuver sleight of hand and sheer gimmickry to move the nation from one fiscal crisis to the next with little strategy to deal with the actual problem at hand
medicare and social security continue to swell with an age population
health care cost grow
a burdensome tax code remain unchanged and economic revival be shadow by the specter of washington 's crisis drive mismanagement
now with a government shutdown loom at month 's end and a crippling default on the nation 's debt possible by mid october congressional leader may have run out the string on legislative trickery
conservative republicans in the house have declare they will not go along with any more gimmickry from their leadership
democrats have vow they will not help republican leader out of their jam without some easing of spending cut
and a way forward to keep the government operating and solvent and to protect the international economy from a default drive shock wave be nowhere to be find as the house be set to vote this week on a stopgap spending plan
what be cause this be the inability at least to this date of our nation 's leader in the house and white house to make good decision timely decision that put our country first say representative scott rigell republican of virginia
it ' really no surprise that we 're in this bind
president obama join the fray monday castigate republicans for the late budget crisis but hop that a light bulb go off
what happen here in washington make a difference he say at a white house event commemorate the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis that help propel him to the presidency
what happen up on capitol hill be go to help determine not only the pace of our growth but also the quality of job the quality of opportunity for this generation and future generation
last week with the body politic focused on syria representative eric cantor of virginia the no
2 house republican trot out his answer to the late fiscal morass
first the house would pass stopgap funding legislation to keep the government open until mid december with a companion clause that would strip all funding to implement president obama 's health care law
sure the senate could simply ignore the health care provision but mr. cantor assure house conservative he would come back with an increase in the government 's borrowing limit that would delay the health care law for one year
the conservative answer
a boisterous and resounding no
certainly we have often use insider washington rule and tool some would call them gimmick to protect people from hard vote say representative mick mulvaney republican of south carolina
that ' be part of washington a long time
but what we 're see here be an unwillingness to accept this as a first step
you can not start with a complete surrender
just five scheduled legislative day stand between the house and a government shutdown
house republican leader and their allies say there be still time to persuade their recalcitrant backbencher to go along with the cantor plan or some variant of it
house republicans will meet wednesday to hash over their option
but the division that have bedevil speaker john a. boehner since he take the gavel in 2011 be back in force
it ' fair to say it look a little gimmicky but at least it would prevent a government shutdown say representative charlie dent a moderate republican from pennsylvania who back the plan
it ' important that republicans stop pretend that mitch mcconnell be the senate majority leader and mitt romney be the president he say refer to mr. mcconnell of kentucky who as leader of senate republicans head the minority party
conservative say they be tired of lose and they be be egg on by activist organization that be demand a hard line
from his new perch head the right lean heritage foundation former senator jim demint have demand an end to pretend vote and gimmick
the conservative activist l. brent bozell iii be rally supporter around legislation that would strip all fund from the affordable care act immediately say he will accept no less
the club for growth a political action committee not bashful about mount primary challenge to republican lawmaker from the right say it will put a black mark on the record of any lawmaker who vote even to bring the cantor plan to the house floor
and an expanding base of internet wire tea party ground troop be keep the pressure on
we 're push back on these gimmick that use to be the coin of the trade in washington say michael a. needham chief executive of heritage action the heritage foundation 's political arm
i think it ' exciting
republican leader can be forgive for their shell shock
for three year such activist have generally look the other way as republicans finessed a path from crisis to crisis
in 2011 the house take the nation to the brink of its first ever debt default despite warning from economist that such a move could plunge the global economy into recession
the way out in part be a special select committee task with produce a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit by around $ 4 trillion over 10 year
the supercommittee fail but the legislation that produce it do lift the debt ceiling
to do it however mr. mcconnell have to dream up another sleight of hand a two step process that allow president obama to raise the debt ceiling himself then give congress a vote to voice its disapproval
even if that disapproval could pass congress it could be veto by the president
thus the government 's borrowing limit would rise without any lawmaker have to vote explicitly to do it
earlier this year house republicans devise another plan to raise the debt ceiling while extract only a token concession
that concession be the no budget no pay act which would have impound the pay of member of congress if they fail to pass a budget
senate democrats comply pass a budget and have berate the house for the past five month for refuse to even try to resolve the vast difference between the house 's spending and tax plan and the senate 's
the house have also all but give up on pass detailed spending bill to comply with its budget
if this be our approach to governance we be in deep trouble mr. rigell fume
with the clock tick frustration with what representative reid ribble republican of wisconsin call all these fiscal cliff and this dance we go into all the time may be reach a crescendo
we just need to find a path forward and we have to get off these conversation about this small stuff mr. ribble say
it ' time we start to deal with the real issue

teenager prosecute in adult court or who do time in adult jail fare bad in life and can go on to commit more violent crime than those who be handle by the juvenile justice system
neuroscience research have find that these young offender do not weigh risk the way adult do make them prone to rash judgment that can land them in trouble with the law
these fact argue for steer adolescent into the juvenile justice system where they can receive rehabilitative service and be spar adult criminal conviction that banish them to society 's margin and make it virtually impossible for them to find job
this logic have prevail throughout the country
but it have so far be ignore in new york state one of only two state the other be north carolina that set the age of adult criminal responsibility at 16
thirty seven state and the district of columbia consider 18 as the age for adult prosecution and 11 state set it at 17
nearly 50,000 16- and 17-year old in new york end up in the criminal court each year a vast majority charge with nonviolent crime like fare beat marijuana possession or shoplifting
that may be change thanks to effort by group like raise the age ny a coalition of justice advocacy group that argue for raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18
among those who have rally to this cause be new york state 's chief judge jonathan lippman and the nassau county district attorney kathleen rice
judge lippman have submit a bill to the legislature that call for the formation of a special court for 16- or 17-year old charge with nonviolent crime
these youth division court would have judge specially train in issue of adolescent development and therapeutic approach to juvenile crime
if the case be resolve in the youth division no criminal charge would be file against the child fingerprint would be destroy and all record would be seal
the goal be to treat child as child instead destroy their life even before they have begin
new york 's decision make in 1962 to define juvenile as those under 16 be mean to be temporary
but inertia quickly set in cause the erroneous decision to stand for 50 year even as tough on crime state begin to see that teenager need special protection
it be well past time for new york to adopt the same sensible policy

the idea of create extensive marine reserve in the southern ocean around antarctica seem like a no brainer
the reserve would protect what be still the most pristine aquatic ecosystem in existence and they would extend to the ocean some of the international protection that the continent enjoy the recognition that the south polar region be a world treasure off limit to the frenzy of resource extraction play out across the rest of the planet
in july at the most recent meeting of the commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources in bremerhaven germany there be a nearly giddy sense of optimism that after repeat failure the proposal would finally pass
but it fail again thanks largely to russia and ukraine who raise unfounded legal objection
and while not completely cave in fish nation like china norway and japan call for small reserve and a sunset clause that would allow for future exploitation and essentially render the whole idea of a permanent reserve meaningless
all this have lead the staunch supporter of the original 875,000-square mile proposal chiefly the united states and new zealand to do exactly the wrong thing
instead of go into the next month 's meeting in hobart australia with renew determination the two country announce last week that they would agree to shrink the propose reserve by 40 percent in the belief that something be better than nothing
this decision reward without a fight the country that oppose the reserve and it seem to have more to do with preserve a process than preserve an ecosystem
it make everyone even the good guy complicit in failure
and behind it all be blindness to the true cost of fish the antarctic as hard as the rest of the ocean and an inability to grasp the fragility of that antarctic and the importance of one of its main specie krill to the rest of the ecosystem
the united states and new zealand and the european country that support the marine reserve have it right the first time

william thompson jr. make a gracious exit from the race for mayor of new york on monday throw his support to bill de blasio who probably get slightly more than 40 percent of the vote in last tuesday 's democratic primary which he need to avoid a runoff with mr. thompson
we say probably because the new york city board of elections have not finish count the vote
for the last week mr. thompson have be in the awkward position of hang around to see whether mr. de blasio 's unofficial 40.3 percent hold up
mr. thompson who get 26.2 percent of the vote saw that his odds be very long and get on with his life
in leave the race mr. thompson call the board 's failure to deliver official result nearly a week after the vote a disgrace
he ' right though its incompetence be hardly a surprise
this be the election after all where more than 5,000 antique lever action voting machine have to be drag out of storage because the board know it could not get optical scanning machine ready for a possible runoff
the board whose member be appoint by county leader of both party be a patronage riddled agency with one job which it do very poorly
last friday worker be catch snooze among the voting machine they be suppose to be rechecking
the most appealing solution be just to abolish the board as mayor michael bloomberg have urge for year and to replace it with a nonpartisan body of skilled professional
but that would require rewrite the state constitution which the legislature would resist
good government organization like the new york public interest research group say there be many way to make the board work better like have city employee replace inept poll worker on election day and have the city council vet its appointee more strictly
perhaps a good civic minded project for mr. bloomberg speaker christine quinn and mr. thompson all of whom know how to run big operation be to take on reform of this abysmal system

young people be different
the supreme court have deliver that message repeatedly over the last decade in limit or flatly prohibit the most severe criminal punishment for those under 18 at the time of their crime
in 2005 the court ban the death penalty for juvenile
in 2010 it outlaw sentence of life without parole for juvenile convict of crime other than homicide
and in a 2012 case miller v. alabama it say juvenile may never receive a mandatory sentence of life without parole which prisoner refer to as the other death penalty
each ruling rely on the eighth amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment have find that young people be constitutionally different from adult and therefore must be punish differently
in each case the court be silent on the question of whether its ruling apply retroactively to inmate who have already be convict
the just answer would surely be yes and court have largely agree make those first two juvenile justice ruling retroactive
but some state insist that the ban on mandatory life without parole do not apply to offender who have already be sentence
in the miller case the court require low court to make individualized sentencing decision for juvenile defendant because juvenile be not as morally culpable as adult and they be more capable of change over time
if the ban on mandatory life without parole be retroactive more than 2,000 prisoner would be eligible for a new sentencing hearing
so far whether these individual can get a new hearing depend on where they live
court in michigan iowa and mississippi have rule that the ban apply to previously sentence juvenile
the department of justice take that position as well
yet the minnesota supreme court and one federal appeal court have take the opposite view
on sept. 4 the louisiana supreme court take on this question in the case of darryl tate who be 17 when he hold up two man and kill one of them in 1981
mr. tate 's lawyer argue that he be entitled to a new sentencing hear under the miller rule because the united states supreme court allow such a rehearing in another juvenile life without parole case decide at the same time as miller
critic fear that allow resentencing would increase violent crime
but court may still impose life without parole provide that the judge first give proper consideration to the mitigating effect of youth
the alabama supreme court set out guideline last week that require a court to consider 14 factor include a defendant 's age emotional maturity family environment and potential for rehabilitation before issue such a sentence
ideally life without parole would never be a sentencing option for juvenile
the supreme court 's own logic suggest this even if it be not willing to go that far
after the miller case three state entirely eliminate juvenile life without parole join six other state that have already ban the sentence and lawsuit on the retroactivity issue be pending in several state
as lawmaker and court deal with this issue they should remember as the supreme court have declare that adolescent be not adult and that principle should apply regardless of the date of a conviction

to the editor your sept. 11 editorial the race to improve global health rightly point out that we still have a long way to go particularly in save mother life the aim of the millennium development goal on maternal health and universal access to reproductive health
but many people may not realize that the lead cause of maternal death be largely preventable and treatable with inexpensive antibiotic and medicine that can stop postpartum bleeding and life threaten hypertension and seizure
even the simple of supply soap and sterile razor can save the life of a mother as she deliver
the tragedy be that these basic inexpensive supply available everywhere and take for grant in rich country be scarce or nonexistent in the poor one
increase access to basic medicine and clean supply would save the life of more than 180,000 woman every year and as many as a third of vulnerable life could be rescue if woman have access to contraception to plan their pregnancy 222 million woman still lack this
in the 21st century no mother should die bring new life into the world especially now that we know what to do as we get close to the deadline of the millennium goals

however a great insistence on good governance and on a new governance goal be essential to achieve current and future development goal
it be possible to measure the impact of governance on the number of child in school and on maternal mortality
our research show that where bribery be low and where there be transparency in how government spend money people have better access to education health and basic service like clean water
galvanize government around good governance can significantly help to meet the development goal at their halfway mark in 2015 and take us beyond to reach new goal for 2030

what i know as an urban mayor be that our city be grow and flourish reverse a half century trend
census bureau statistic reveal that the country 's urban population grow by 12.1 percent from 2000 to 2010 outpace the country 's overall growth rate of 9.7 percent
mayors across america be welcome this new growth by champion restaurant gallery and museum
they be make their city safer build park and recreation facility and improve public school so that family stay rather than head for the suburb like their parent
the success of our city also benefit our suburb as those community adopt successful urban housing policy like high density dwelling near train station and micro city environment that mirror urban living
so perhaps the headline should have read
as our city rise so do our suburbs

to the editor never have the case be make more strongly however inadvertently for the necessity of the two state solution for the israeli palestinian conflict than in ian s. lustick 's fantasy about the need to dump the idea two state illusion sunday review sept. 15
anyone who care about the jewish people and take into account both the wonderful aspect as well as the immense tragedy of jewish history must shudder at mr. lustick 's willingness to dismiss the existence of the first independent jewish state in 2,000 year
his argument about what will ensue after the abandonment of the goal of two state be a fancy version of a one state solution that end the concept of jewish self determination
the founding of the modern state of israel be a profound historical development
its safety and survival must be nurture and protect
yes the two state solution be difficult to achieve but it be the only one that provide opportunity for palestinian self determination without abandon jewish sovereignty in the land of israel
mr. lustick 's essay ultimately remind us of the need to get move toward that goal
while there be some in israel too who say there can be no two state solution the leadership and vast majority of its people see it as the only solution
unfortunately palestinians still have not make that leap primarily because they like mr. lustick do not place any value on a jewish state
indeed some may conclude that give up on two state may produce their old goal the disappearance of israel without war terrorism or boycott
kenneth jacobson deputy national director anti defamation league new york sept. 15 2013
to the editor ian s. lustick 's essay offer an illogical unachievable agenda that do no favor either to israelis or palestinians
professor lustick 's comparison of the israeli palestinian situation to effort by british colonialist to maintain control of ireland france 's colonial rule of algeria and communist rule in the soviet union be off base
the point of the two state solution be to end israel 's occupation of palestinian territory and to fulfill the palestinian right to self determination
likewise the notion that israelis whose family come from arab country would consider themselves arabs be absurd
they manage to preserve their jewish identity for 2,000 year in exile
why would they give it up now
in any case as israelis of european origin increasingly marry with the child and grandchild of family who come from arab land the distinction between the two be fast erode
the main problem with professor lustick 's analysis be that it be a recipe for permanent conflict
both israelis and palestinians want to fulfill their national aspiration in their own country
neither will be satisfied with less and the two state solution remain the only way to achieve that
alan elsner vice president communications j street washington sept. 15 2013 to the editor
have have my eye open by three visit to israel i find ian s. lustick 's essay refreshingly clear and knowledgeable
even now the united states turn a blind eye while israel continue expansion and brutal military tactic
i believe that the whole point of decade of israeli encroachment onto fertile area of the west bank and the imprisonment of palestinians in gaza have be to make a viable second state impossible
mr. lustick offer a realistic vision of the mideast today
janet jones san francisco sept. 15 2013 to the editor
although two state illusion argue against a two state solution between israel and palestine most of the main historical analogy the writer cite demonstrate exactly the opposite outcome
in the case of ireland algeria and the soviet union solution be create that allow two or more state to exist ireland and britain algeria and france the former soviet republic and russia
there be however one difference with the israel palestine case
none of the other national movement be bent on the ultimate annihilation of the other state with which they be in conflict
even illusion can be inspiring and highly adaptive when as in each of those historical example out of respect or simply self interest each party basically accept the right of the other to exist

state college pa. during the first week of class at penn state last month john nichols sit in his office in the old wing of the willard building across the lawn from old main fume about what people have be say for two year now about the university he love
the campus be bustle
the student have return
this bucolic town 's main drag college avenue have come alive
store sell shirt that read billieve and o'brien 's lions
football season be close and almost everyone seem excited for coach bill o'brien 's second year
nichols sit behind his large wooden desk surround by four full bookshelf
he have spend 36 year at penn state
he raise his child here
he be a professor emeritus and a former chairman of the faculty senate
now he be talk about jerry sandusky and joe paterno and he be get angry
he sit up straighter
his eye bulge
he throw his hand up

just this last weekend i be with some of my close friend in another state he say
of course the subject always come up always come up
it ' like a scarlet letter
and when i say that most of what you have read be not true they look at you like even close friend they look at you like
be you a holocaust denier
you have drink the penn state kool aid
what other conspiracy theory do you have
can you imagine the frustration when you know that there ' be a gross mischaracterization of what have happen at penn state
and that i and my kid who graduate from penn state my friend and colleague here be go to have to live with be guilty for crime we do not commit
nichols be among those in the large penn state community include current and former faculty alumnus and fan still upset at how the child sexual abuse scandal involve sandusky paterno 's longtime top assistant be handle by the institution 's leadership
still upset about the report put forth by the former f.b.i. director louis j. freeh that say paterno and others cover up sandusky 's crime
still upset about the n.c.a.a. sanction base on the report and what they say be the false narrative perpetuate by the news medium
still upset about how they think the scandal come to define penn state unfairly
terry engelder a professor of geosciences in his 28th year at penn state say in an e mail that some faculty member be still agitated because the rush to unfair judgment have do unspeakable damage to the university 's reputation worldwide
the scandal continue to have ripple effect
the university 's board of trustee have authorize penn state to spend about $ 60 million to settle about 30 outstanding claim with sandusky 's victim
the former university president graham b. spanier the former athletic director tim curley and the former university vice president gary schultz be set to stand trial for their suspect role in a cover up of sandusky 's action
sandusky be convict last year of 45 count of child sexual abuse and sentence to 30 to 60 year in prison
the football team be prohibit from play in a bowl game for three more season and it have scholarship restriction that run through the 2017 season
nichols do not want to forget the scandal just yet
he say that the entire university have be implicate in the public 's mind that it have be accept as fact that there be a cover up he say without due process
of the five man who be most connect to the scandal nichols point out only sandusky have be convict
paterno die last year and spanier curley and schultz have yet to stand trial
if they be find not guilty of the charge against them include perjury conspiracy and endanger the welfare of child nichols say it would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the freeh report and the n.c.a.a. penalty would have no basis
i think a lot of people this include me be really root that they be find not guilty he say because that would start roll back the narrative
he sigh
we would like to think it would be duke 2 the duke lacrosse case where the truth would finally emerge he say

but i think there ' a grow sense that that ' probably not go to happen
last year the faculty senate appoint nichols to lead a study mean to complement the freeh report
the study examine the current state of the university and way to move forward
his report be release in march 2013 to little fanfare
it conclude in part that more collaboration and better communication be need between the board of trustee and the rest of the university 1 2 next page
on sept. 9 a rag blaze in an abandon three story house in the bronx draw more than a hundred firefighter take nearly three hour to bring under control and leave a charred structure in place of what have be an unloved neighborhood eyesore
that seem to be the end of the story
but on monday a demolition crew clear the remains of the board up graffiti splotch house at 61 buchanan place find a dead body around 10 a.m.
a few hour later they find two more
the new york police department say that all three of the victim their body severely burn their name and age unknown be man
fire and police official say that it be not immediately clear whether they have die in the fire though that appear to be the likely cause
official do not say where in the house the body be find
how the three man may have come to be inside the derelict building appear less mysterious neighbor say the house have attract squatter for year
i saw people go into the basement most of the time say shamsun khalique 59 who have live across the street for nearly 35 year
she say she would see group of man often intoxicate come and go from the house which abut a large apartment building on the short street on the edge of fordham heights
they be like live there miss khalique say
they use to bring this dog outside the basement

the building be also on the radar of local firefighter as potentially hazardous say frank dwyer a fire department spokesman
so when the fire break out around 4:30 a.m. and then grow firefighter battle it from the outside
when you 're deal with a vacant building board up with know hazard it ' dangerous anyway and now it ' on fire he say
you 're not go to put member in danger if there ' no people know to be inside
it be unclear where the fire begin and fire marshal and police arson investigator have be examine its cause even before the body be discover
now those effort have be join by bronx detective
as for why the three body be not find immediately after the fire mr. dwyer say that fire investigator have enter the house after the blaze but have not go into every room because of structural damage
by 2034 the second avenue subway will wind through manhattan the metrocard will be long dead and few rider will remember an age without countdown clock
but to deliver new york city to this gilded future of transit the metropolitan transportation authority will need a few thing
in a presentation on monday at the authority 's headquarters in midtown official brief board member on a 20-year $ 106 billion list to address core capital need stretch from 2015 to 2034
the full list a precursor to the authority 's 2015 19 capital plan be expect to be publish later this month
the preview hint at the authority 's decision make at a critical moment in its operation ridership have climb to the point of overcrowding on some line sprawl megaprojects be approach their completion in the come year and part of the system be still reel from hurricane sandy
many of the possible investment be of a piece with priority discuss by thomas f. prendergast since his confirmation as the authority 's chairman in june costly if unsexy improvement to age signal system and communication equipment
more than a quarter of the $ 68.2 billion in estimate need for the authority 's new york city transit division belong to this category
about one fifth of the $ 68.2 billion be to replace subway car and bus
but some item make it clear that the authority have enter a new phase particularly when compare with long term plan from decade past as safety concern and unreliable service mean that merely stabilize the system be a chief goal say stephen a. berrang the authority 's director for capital program management
the authority 's list of emerge priority now include improved customer information like a systemwide network of countdown clock which be a focus of a presentation in july on how to attract grow population of young rider to the transit system
the need assessment also call for a successor to the metrocard system which transit official say can not be maintain beyond 2019 and place an increase focus on stormproofing since hurricane sandy
mr. berrang say for instance that the authority have raise resiliency standard on part of the infrastructure like cable and power relay since the storm
and in what could be a welcome change for midtown commuter and tourist the authority have call for circulation improvement at the labyrinthine station in times square and grand central terminal
the authority say its current signal system allow 29 train per hour to run on the lexington avenue line
but during many peak period only 26 run per hour because crowding often keep train in station longer than expect
the authority 's plan to bring the long island rail road into grand central be expect to introduce additional strain
it create effectively a train traffic jam mr. berrang say of the current crowding
the authority say option include add staircase to improve passenger flow and add metrocard turnstile which if the agency have its way will be outdated in three to five year
drill for shale ga through hydraulic fracturing or fracking appear to cause small leak of the greenhouse ga methane than the federal government have estimate and considerably small than some critic of shale ga have fear accord to a peer review study release on monday
the study conduct by the university of texas and sponsor by the environmental defense fund and nine petroleum company bolster the contention by advocate of fracking and some environmental group as well that shale ga be clean and better than coal at least until more renewable energy source be develop
more than 500 well be analyze
the texas study conclude that while the total amount of escape methane from shale ga operation be substantial more than one million ton annually it be probably less than the environmental protection agency estimate in 2011
in particular it indicate that containment measure capture 99 percent of methane that escape from new well be prepare for production a process know as completion
the environmental protection agency have begin to require drillers to control leak during completion which be believe to be one of the major source of methane loss at fracking well
although control will not be require until january 2015 a number of company already capture escaped gas at well be prepare for production
can we control it
thanks to new e.p.a. regulation come online the answer to that be good news eric pooley a senior vice president at the environmental defense fund say in an interview
the report be publish monday in the proceeding of the national academy of sciences
with the study which run from may through december of last year the university be the first to conduct detailed examination of individual drilling site
it do so with the consent of petroleum company which provide about 90 percent of the financing for the study
previous e.p.a. estimate rely on engineering calculation and other study gather data via aircraft flight over drilling site
the study 's connection to the petroleum industry among its sponsor and financier be shell anadarko petroleum corporation exxon mobil and chevron may lead some to question its objectivity some outside expert say
but most say the research and the reputation of the researcher appear solid
previous study that have get a lot of attention have have red flag jump out all over them
this one do n't say michael a. levi the director of the program on energy security and climate change at the council on foreign relations
in an e mail statement shell 's president marvin odum call the study a prime example of key group that may not have the exact same interest work collaboratively and take a science base approach to the methane problem
mr. odum say that collect actual emission data rather than rely on estimate would ensure that both improvement effort and regulatory change can be focus on the area that will have the big impact
the report come at a time when shale ga drilling be grow at a breakneck pace production now 30 percent of all united states natural ga be expect to reach 50 percent by 2040 but also when the industry be beset by controversy
citizen group accuse drillers of despoil stream and water supply and supplier of wreck local road with parade of massive truck
environmental group have split sharply over whether to support shale ga development as a clean fuel that will suffice until wind and solar power assume a great share of the nation 's energy supply
the texas study be the most comprehensive look to date at a contentious issue in the debate over fracking the extent to which methane leak during drilling and production offset the environmental benefit of the clean burn natural ga the well produce
when burn as fuel methane the main component of natural ga be comparatively clean produce less carbon dioxide than coal and oil
but vent to the air it be a short live but extremely potent greenhouse ga trap heat at a much high rate than carbon dioxide the main greenhouse ga
such potency mean that even a small loss of methane to the air just 3.4 percent scientist say can negate its climate change advantage over coal
some previous study suggest that as much as 7.9 percent of all shale ga be lose to the atmosphere a figure that include every stage of the ga process from well to stove or furnace burner
the texas study do not examine potential loss outside the drilling pad
but its conclusion that loss at the well be comparatively low could remove one issue from the debate
the environmental defense fund be lead other research effort that should address loss elsewhere include a look at methane leak in municipal ga distribution line
the american petroleum institute hail the study 's conclusion say in a statement that its own effort to reduce methane emission be pay off
but while e.p.a.-mandated measure appear to have reduce emission during well completion the study also conclude that leak elsewhere in the fracking process be high than the e.p.a. have previously estimate
estimate of leak from chemical pump while small be twice past estimate while leak from pneumatic controller or valve be peg at more than 639,000 ton a year roughly a third great
none of those component be currently subject to federal regulation
maybe it be not that surprising that william c. thompson jr. would come up just shy
it be not just that he pull in far few black and latino vote than his adviser have confidently predict for him in the recent democratic primary for mayor
nor be it that he fall a few thousand vote short over all from force bill de blasio into a runoff one in which he would have face long odds anyway
instead when mr. thompson abandon his quest on monday in a disappointing coda to a campaign fill with what ifs over everything from demographic to his message it present a microcosm of a dutiful but not quite compelling career
whether he be the smart money pick as he be this year or the underdog as he be when he lose to mayor michael r. bloomberg in 2009 mr. thompson could never quite concoct the right recipe to parlay his two term as a steady new york city comptroller into something grand
a product of brooklyn machine politics mr. thompson believe strongly in by the book tactic like gather institutional endorsement
yet he never lead in a single poll
he never surge or collapse unlike some of his rival
and despite campaigning for 24 hour straight not once but twice in the past six week the mild mannered mr. thompson could never convince voter that he have enough political thunder
he be a very smart very talented public servant who have do everything people would want him to do but it always seem like it ' not enough say basil a. smikle jr. a democratic consultant who teach at columbia university and the city university of new york
even on the eve of the primary mr. thompson struggle to connect with voter who should have be in his column
at a deli on flatbush avenue in brooklyn he have just utter a quick hello and remind people about election day when stephon zephyr say excuse me big guy you run for mayor
mr. thompson surprised say yes
then in barely audible tone he talk to mr. zephyr a 26-year old plumber for five minute about job and gun violence
after mr. thompson leave mr. zephyr shrug
he sound good but he do not say much
he just brush me off
on paper mr. thompson enter the campaign with many advantage
he have win the admiration of democrats for come closer than expect to unseat mr. bloomberg four year ago
and in a city where minority be now the majority mr. thompson the son and namesake of a respected judge and former legislator stand out as the only black candidate with a long resume in both the public and private sector
count on demographic to give him an edge mr. thompson amass an impressive list of endorsement party stalwart like fernando ferrer fiscal watchdog
richard ravitch black pastor who have back mr. bloomberg in 2009 former representative floyd h. flake and key union the united federation of teachers
one of his big fund raiser be former senator alfonse m. d'amato the republican power broker
together they argue that mr. thompson who at 60 be the old major democratic contender have the best experience and the temperament to govern
but his establishment friendly strategy have blind spot accord to more than a dozen people both affiliate with and independent of the campaign
billy thompson be as decent a man as you will find in new york city politics say neal kwatra a democratic consultant who do not work for any mayoral candidate

but billy and his team be captive of a bygone era of coalition and identity politics
foremost be the assumption that people have cast a pro thompson vote in 2009 rather than an anti bloomberg one
nor do mr. thompson take seriously the theory that mr. bloomberg 's margin may have be diminish because some of his supporter anticipate a blowout do not bother to vote
those assumption may have give mr. thompson a false sense of security even as he fade from public view for three year
he show up think well now it ' my turn because you guy like me you really like me,'â say christina greer a political science professor at fordham

but a lot of new yorkers seem to say i can not remember who you are.'â
another problem be that mr. thompson never articulate a clear message
muddled be a word use by many
he develop a centrist platform better suit to a general election than a democratic primary oppose tax increase while mr. de blasio hammer away at income inequality
his thread the needle position on the stop and frisk police tactic in particular exasperate many minority and liberal
by contrast mr. de blasio position himself as the tactic fierce critic 1 2 next page
san francisco with emirates team new zealand hold a huge lead head into the final stage of the america 's cup it remain unclear just what the team will do with the competition if it go on to defeat oracle team usa. will race be in multihulls again or in monohulls
in big boat again or in small boat
close to the shore again or back in the heart of auckland 's vast hauraki gulf
but grant dalton the combative managing director of team new zealand have make two thing clear
he want the cost of compete in the next edition of the cup to be considerably less expensive in order to attract more team
he also want to restore a nationality rule
the nationality debate have long be contentious in the cup
for now hull must be manufacture in the nation of the challenging yacht club but there be no nationality restriction on sailor involve
that be why oracle which represent san francisco 's golden gate yacht club and the united states can compete with just one american rome kirby on its 11-man crew which feature sailor of seven nationality in sunday 's race
this be in keep with the owner larry ellison 's global approach to talent recruitment and with the prevail recent view that america 's cup team be close in spirit to motor racing 's
formula one team more about brand identity and push technological boundary than about national identity and a patriotic agenda
i love america and i love to say that my family be american say james spithill oracle 's australian helmsman and skipper who be married to an american
spithill add but i tell you what i be not go to try to hide from the fact that we have different nationality in our team because i be proud of every one of them and the idea and creativity they bring
dalton and team new zealand have a different vision
nine of their start crew member be new zealanders the other two be australians with strong new zealand connection
it ' a very homogeneous crew while ellison ' get an international free agency crew say gary jobson the american who win the 1977 america 's cup as tactician to ted turner and be now a television analyst
i strongly believe that the america 's cup deed of gift be write as a friendly competition between foreign country and i think the american boat should have all americans the new zealand boat ought to have all kiwis and the french boat should have all french
and if you do that i think the america 's cup would mean a lot more to a lot of people
new zealand with a population of about 4.4 million have long punch well above its demographic weight in the sailing world
new zealanders have be fixture on nearly all the major team in the past four cup cycle
oracle also have a strong kiwi influence
russell coutts the team 's chief executive and former skipper be a new zealander
the imposition of nationality restriction would presumably cost kiwis some sail job as well
but dalton say he be convince that the event need to tack away from the billionaire versus billionaire approach that have be back in vogue in the last decade
we stand for a strong nationality rule he say earlier this year in an occasionally testy onstage debate with coutts in new zealand
the question be how strong a rule
fulfil jobson 's vision and create full olympic style national team would probably discourage team from emerge sail nation like china and south korea
their home country sailor simply could not be competitive against the establish power

grant dalton 's idea from what i understand after talk to him would be to have a weak nationality rule for newcomer for new country which seem fair say bruno trouble a french former america 's cup helmsman
but establish team could also struggle with a new rule

i wo not opine on that but i will tell you this be not a charlotte police department problem mr. chestnut say
it ' a glaring example that there be folk with gun and badge in america that lack discernment and intelligence and judgment
the department 's quick move to bring charge he say be influence by the 2012 shoot death in florida of trayvon martin a 17-year old african american
trayvon martin be a recipe for what not to do he say

woman or nothing the new comedy by the filmmaker ethan coen feel like a short play that have be heavily pad
perhaps this should not be a surprise mr. coen have write several one act but this be his first full length stage work
somewhere inside this bloated comedy about two lesbian in search of some viable sperm there may be a skinny sex farce struggle to break free
be that too much information for an opening paragraph
the word sperm can be a little startling over morning coffee or for that matter an evening cocktail
sorry about that but the play which open on monday at the atlantic theater company in a production direct by david cromer rest entirely on the lead character improbable quest for this substance
soon after the light go up on an enviably chic new york apartment we find gretchen halley feiffer bustle around the shelf stock with art book and expensive look gewgaw remove select photograph and tuck them away in a closet
when her partner laura susan pourfar arrive home they have a slightly tense argument about the plan gretchen have hatch to help them have a baby
scorn the anonymity of sperm bank and the potential lack of rigor involve in their screening process gretchen have decide to recruit a viable donor herself
the twist be he ' be volunteer involuntarily the colleague she ' deem genetically desirable for their purpose wo not know that he ' be use
this do not sit well with laura a concert pianist with a rather more stringent ethical sense than gretchen who be a lawyer
what be it that make us human
laura loftily ask
ms. pourfar employ a rather grand sound accent
it ' know what we 're do choose what we 're do
gretchen play by ms. feiffer with perky energy breezily dismiss her qualm and continue prepare to set the trap she ' lay although since only laura can conceive she ' the one who will be do the seduce over a casual dinner
gretchen plan to run late and then call to cancel
mr. coen elicit some bite humor from their gentle tussle over the subject as when laura learn that the donor have be select in part because he happen to be move to florida soon
i would not sleep with a normal man laura say
how could i sleep with a man who want to live in florida
their long scene of tart exchange about the merit of sperm bank versus room service as laura call it lead to gradual rapprochement
unfortunately this talky scene also leave the audience with lot of time to ponder the absurdity of their enterprise
laura may be resign to her role but we on the other side of the proverbial footlights may still have some reservation
be the woman so unaware of the physiology of insemination that they imagine that a single encounter with a man will necessarily achieve the desire result
this be particularly germane give laura 's age 40
since laura have never sleep with a man she ' a gold star lesbian she say later do she make a likely one shot man trap
in any case man who sleep around be likely to ponder potential consequence when they be contemplate sex
at no point do anyone mention the possibility of their guinea pig 's request a condom
and many lesbian couple who be also wary of sperm bank choose a good friend to donate in a less intimate and less chancey manner an option that go unmentioned here
willing suspension of disbelief be of course often a prerequisite at the theater
but when the superstructure of the plot be found on a notion as rickety as the one drive woman or nothing it ' hard not to feel disengage
my objection be hardly put to rest when the donor himself arrive in the play 's second scene
the lanky handsome but bookish look chuck robert beitzel hardly seem the kind of heedless priapic guy who would chase any skirt
the nervous laura begin down cocktail and ply chuck with same but their conversation be high minded laura 's cynicism about her career i 'm a brand name now she say i 'm burma shave be counter by chuck 's assertion that her art no doubt touch an audience
soon they be find common ground in meander talk of manner and moral but the comic potential in this unlikely seduction go unrealized

the history of baseball be full of famous collapse that enable team to qualify for the playoff against all expectation
the 1978 red sox the 1964 phillies and the 2007 mets be but a few whose collapse pave the way for more fortunate team
but if the yankees be to earn one of the two american league wild card spot it will probably require one of baseball 's great multiteam collapse
but as alex rodriguez say after sunday 's ugly 9 2 loss to boston you never know crazy thing have happen
the final two week of the regular season would have to be particularly crazy for thing to break the yankees way
as of monday morning there be six team with a chance at the two wild card spot and myriad circumstance to get two of those team into the playoff
a week ago the yankees be in position to control their own fate
in fact they do by lose
after be sweep by the red sox this past weekend the yankees could still miss the playoff even if they win the rest of their game
but their playoff hop remain alive
the only thing we can do be go out and play and win the game that we be in c. c. sabathia say
obviously we need a little help
but if we do not win that help wo not even matter
we need to win most of the rest of the game we be play and then see what happen
the yankees who be off monday have 12 game leave
they be 79 71 and be three game behind the tampa bay rays and the texas rangers the leader in the a.l. wild card race enter monday 's game
the rangers visit the rays on monday to begin a four game series
the cleveland indians begin a three game series at kansas city
the outcome of that series be also important because the indians be two and a half game ahead of the yankees and the royals be a half game behind them
i know we be right in the mix rodriguez say
it ' nothing that a two- or three game winning streak can not fix
if we go out and win four of the next five start tuesday i think we be right back in this thing
if you take boston away over the last two or three week we have play pretty good baseball
the orioles be a half game ahead of the yankees but they have the unenviable task of play the red sox six more time
if the rays win three of the four game against texas this week and the yankees sweep the blue jays which will not be easy because the blue jays have r. a. dickey pitch tuesday the yankees will be one game behind texas in the loss column and three behind the ray
but they have three game leave against the rays at yankee stadium
the indians have be play well recently but the struggle of the rangers and the rays have give the yankees reason to believe even after their dismal showing in boston
i do not stop believe manager joe girardi say
we 're not the only team that ' run into hard time in the month of september and august
there ' other team that have run into hard time too
we still have a great opportunity
yeah we have to win a lot of game but the opportunity be in front of us
the rangers go into monday 's game have lose 6 straight and 9 of their previous 10
the rays have lose 14 of their previous 21 game
the yankees on the other hand have just complete the hard part of their schedule against the red sox
they have three more at toronto and then three at home against the san francisco giants and three against the rays before they head to houston for three against the astros who have the bad record in baseball
every day be a new opportunity for us say phil hughes who be back in the rotation and schedule to pitch wednesday in toronto
i feel good about it
i feel like the schedule could work in our favor provide we win
right now there ' a lot of team that have their eye on the wild card
it ' a dogfight
the report make for chilling reading
the finding be beyond doubt and beyond the pale
this be a war crime
ban ki moon secretary general of the united nations on confirmation of the chemical weapon attack in syria
there be liberty gold coin and krugerrands and a gold chain so thick that have it be use as a restraining device it may have do a fair job of keep tom eli behind bar
but the purpose of the gold bauble chain include be exactly the opposite mr. eli 's romany family seek to use them as collateral for his $ 50,000 bail to secure his release from rikers island
and therein lay the reason for an unusual hearing on monday at state supreme court in manhattan as prosecutor seek to challenge the provenance of the jewelry
mr. eli 's lawyer grow indignant that his client have to spend another night on rikers simply because the judge be not convinced that the man 's family have obtain the pile of gold lawfully
with the defendant 's mother a 72-year old retired carnival worker and part time palm reader still sit in the witness box the judge firmly remind the lawyer that a prior associate of the defendant 's show up with $ 50,000 in cash to cover the bail but change his mind when he learn that there would be such a hearing
poof he disappear say the judge charles h. solomon

so something ' fishy obviously
that certainly make me suspicious
prosecutor say mr. eli 41 slash a man outside 230 fifth a nightclub in the flatiron district on april 14
mr. eli 's lawyer thomas a. kenniff wag an anthropological argument
after century of be chase from country to country the roma sometimes call gypsies have develop an aversion to traditional institution include bank and have their own internal economy
he say he fear that his client be be treat differently from similarly situate people because of his background
mr. kenniff call to the stand dr. ruth andersen who have study the romany people since the 1970 and say that many who live in the united states still follow ancient tradition include pass down gold coin and necklace as heirloom and own those piece communally
their gold be heirloom gold dr. andersen say
if someone be desperate and have to sell the gold for money they would be heartbroken
there be many romany people who would sooner starve
next come the defendant 's mother lulu eli costello who testify that she have obtain the jewelry from various relative at her wedding in 1962 and from the in law of her son when they marry through the year
i hold on to them like security she say
she say she be bear in jasper tex
and then move around a lot
she begin work at fair and carnival in game and concession when she marry
we use to cover a lot of state all over she say
every week be in a different spot
but the prosecutor in the case michael pasinkoff seek to characterize the family as less than trustworthy
he ask mrs. costello about the arrest of several member of her family reach all the way back to her father 's arrest on attempt murder charge in 1972 and also mention that the son in jail have a violent felony conviction
mr. pasinkoff then show mrs. costello a legal complaint he say she sign against her granddaughter five year ago accuse the young woman of steal $ 30,000 in jewelry from her
ms. costello say she do not recognize the complaint
i do not know what it be and i do not know where it come from she say
my granddaughter be a very good girl
frankfurt the real political drama in germany this year may get under way only after chancellor angela merkel face the voter
as state election in bavaria underline on sunday ms. merkel 's personal popularity conceal a high degree of political fragmentation
that could make it tricky for her to assemble a govern coalition especially if her center right christian democratic party perform the way poll suggest win this sunday 's national election but fall short of an outright majority
her current coalition partner the free democratic party do so poorly in the bavarian election that it may emerge from the national vote with no seat
that could force ms. merkel who be seek a third term to make a power sharing deal with the main opposition party the more left lean social democrats
meanwhile pop up party notably the anti euro alternative for germany have occupy political space vacate by ms. merkel as she move leave on issue like a national minimum wage and nuclear power
the situation underline the major role that small party can play in german politics and the grow willingness of german voter to switch from one party to another
it use to be that 30 percent of the voter would vote for the christian democrats no matter what the party say or do say stephan werhahn a grandson of konrad adenauer the country 's first postwar chancellor
today the voter orient themselves accord to their personal interest say mr. werhahn a munich lawyer who himself defect from the christian democrats to a minor party last year but then return this year
the party have have to take over more issue that be not in harmony with their basic principle in order to attract these voter german politics be still much more orderly than in some other european country like italy and greece
still germany 's level of voter unrest be puzzle give that the country have not suffer nearly as much from the euro crisis
unemployment here be near record low
the situation in germany be still very different from italy or greece which be really under strain say thomas harjes chief economist at barclays germany
he say some voter may feel a sense of powerlessness in the face of global force that breed disillusion with mainstream party
no party have feel the new fickleness of voter more acutely than the pro business free democrats long a fixture in the country 's postwar politics
just four year after win almost 15 percent in the national vote they be at risk of fall short of the 5 percent need to field a delegation to the national parliament
if they do fail ms. merkel may need to form a so call grand coalition with the social democrats
she could then have to balance their leave lean demand with the right wing of her own party which be already grumpy about her support for euro zone bailouts even as citizen of receive country have excoriate her insistence on austerity
some of her disgruntled party member have even defect to alternative for germany
one be karl georg glehn a lawyer from cologne who be one of several hundred people in frankfurt on saturday to attend an alternative rally in front of city hall
we 're liable for billion from the greek economy which be bankrupt cronyistic and corrupt he say
they would be better off with their own currency
merkel be silent on all these problem
alternative for germany be the wild card in sunday 's election
it field no candidate in bavaria but its voter be regard as highly commit and likely to vote and poll show the party could come close to win enough vote nationally to get seat in parliament
i have a feeling there be an undercurrent of sympathy that be be underestimate say christian meurer a political satirist and author of a recent book the wackos who be govern us die irren die uns regieren
seat in parliament would give the alternative party a soapbox in berlin and allow it to play a disruptive role in debate about european policy while make it hard for ms. merkel to muster a majority

the headline these debate will generate will be very harmful say mr. harjes the economist
ms. merkel will also have to contend with the christian democrats sister party the christian social union in bavaria which be feel its oat after a commanding victory last sunday
the party which normally do not field candidate outside bavaria win enough vote to form a state government by itself
predominantly roman catholic it be more conservative on many issue than the christian democrats and will probably demand a substantial number of cabinet post as payment for bavaria 's support in parliament
in a sense the free democrats unexpectedly strong showing nationally four year ago when they win 14.6 percent wind up contribute to their steep decline
despite hold several cabinet post they be unable to deliver promise tax overhaul ms. merkel prefer to focus on cut debt
and free democrat leader fight among themselves
it be our own fault say jã¶rg uwe hahn the minister of justice in the state of hessen who be also a member of the free democrats national govern body
on the core issue tax the party do not deliver quickly and decisively enough
mr. hahn say though that he be optimistic the free democrats would win the 5 percent of the national vote need to get into parliament
when the party have be in trouble in the past christian democrats often cross over to make sure it could be a coalition partner
karl heinz paque an economist who be formerly leader of the free democrat delegation in the saxony anhalt state parliament say it be inconceivable that the party would be exclude from national politics
the f.d.p. be part of german history he say
greenburgh n.y. rangers defenseman marc staal and center dominic moore be approach the season from drastically different perspective of redemption

the previous season staal sustain a concussion in a collision with eric during a game and miss 46 game
staal who pair with michael del zotto against the devils be not one to complain even with a right eye permanently dilate
be i nervous
not really staal say
maybe i be more conscious of what i be do out there and try to get better
i know i have a lot of work ahead
rangers coach alain vigneault say he be encourage by staal 's performance
he be a little anxious and rightfully so vigneault say
he do not give up on puck talk to his partner all night long
it ' only go to get better for mark
the path back for moore a gritty 33-year old center be wholly different
moore who score the rangers goal monday skip all of last season after his wife katie die last january from liver cancer
moore last play for san jose at the end of the 2011 12 season after he be trade from tampa bay late that season
you 're a little bit unsure because you have not play in so long moore say add i feel good i feel strong i feel fast
the timing will come
moore break into the n.h.l. with the rangers who pick him in the third round of the 2000 draft out of harvard
he be a key member of the 2005 6 tom renney coach squad that surprise the league with 100 point after the season cancel 2004 5 lockout
moore center a hard work line with colton orr on right wing and ryan hollweg on the left
the rangers trade him in july 2006 to nashville which immediately ship him to pittsburgh
after 59 game with the penguins moore be trade to minnesota and later skate for toronto buffalo florida montreal tampa bay and san jose
he be a valuable playoff performer for the canadiens in 2010 and the lightning in 2011 as both team reach the eastern conference final
moore recall his first training camp with the rangers 13 year ago when he cross path with adam graves who be play his final season
i remember how adam come around and talk to all the young guy tap on our shin pad and tell us we be do a great job moore say
that kind of support be tremendous and i hope i can help the young player here now as a veteran
a vital member of the rangers 1994 stanley cup win team graves say it be meaningful to have a player of moore 's caliber on the current squad
you can not say enough about his dedication work ethic and the quality person he be say graves who be in charge of hockey and business operation for the rangers
he ' the type of player everyone can learn from
moore say he be particularly look forward to reunite with the all star goaltender henrik lundqvist a fellow rangers rookie in 2005 6
obviously those be special time when you be first break in say moore who center a line with the youngster brandon mashinter on left wing and shawn o'donnell on the right against the devils
that year we show what ' possible when a team be on the same page
i feel we can have the same potential this season
florham park n.j. dee milliner make a few mental miscue and his coach infuriate yank him from the game
this occur thursday night against the patriots
it also happen three year ago in milliner 's freshman season at alabama
they be simple mistake then he say just as they be in the first half of the jets 13 10 loss to new england
milliner rebound to earn a cornerback spot on the southeastern conference 's all freshman team
he have 14 game to make a similar recovery with the jets but his immediate future be uncertain
milliner seem to understand his current predicament why coach rex ryan remain noncommittal on whether milliner will regain his start role for sunday 's game against buffalo
you know you 're go to go through struggle no matter if you 're young or whatever you be milliner say
so you have just get to get through it
as a freshman at alabama milliner do in large part because injury and graduation gutted the crimson tide 's secondary require him to learn on the job
the jets after draft him ninth over all believe in his potential but as ryan say monday we 've get to do what ' best for us
if milliner do not start on sunday he be still likely to play
but any reduction in playing time could be view as an acknowledgment that he be not ready to assume the responsibility that the jets heap on him
despite miss their off season program because of shoulder surgery three day of full squad workout after stag a weeklong holdout from training camp and the final two preseason game because of injury milliner be list atop their first depth chart ahead of kyle wilson who draw raf from ryan throughout the off season
we be comfortable with him physically there be no question we be ryan say of milliner
now do he miss a lot of time
he absolutely do
we think he could handle it
but again it ' not that i be totally
oh hey he ' fail
that ' not the case
we have to correct a few thing
milliner struggle in the season opener against tampa bay show a lack of awareness on a 17-yard touchdown catch by mike williams
precisely what cause his benching against new england remain unclear but he appear to be at fault during the broken coverage that yield aaron dobson 's 39-yard touchdown reception and he benefit from video replay overrule a touchdown by kenbrell thompkins
milliner hint that he be aware of the in game adjustment he should have make but be just slow to react
the jets draft milliner because of his physical attribute and cover skill
milliner say the most challenging aspect of his transition to the n.f.l. have be the mental adjustment analyze receiver tendency learn the nuance of coverage scheme
he say film review have be valuable help him form a picture of what he do wrong so that he will not make the same mistake twice
it work for him at alabama he say and so he hop it will again
i 've just get to move fast and be alert
milliner say
smith 's option to run
it be not that the jets necessarily want geno smith to run more but they do want him to recognize run opportunity when they arise
bemoan his fourth quarter interception at the patriots 11 which cost the jets a chance to at least tie the score smith say monday that on the play a third and-4 he should have rush for the first down instead of try to squeeze the ball to santonio holmes in a tight space
in those time if need be i have get to tuck the ball down and run smith say
after lead the jets with 47 rush yard against tampa bay smith run three time for 17 yard against new england include a 16-yard third quarter scamper on second and-13
run be not smith 's default setting he consider himself a pocket passer with mobility look to throw downfield and then react if his option be cover
rex ryan say if it ' take away from you then it ' not a bad deal to take off with it
injured be return for a team that play twice in five day the jet be remarkably healthy
and they be optimistic that defensive lineman muhammad wilkerson right ankle sprain a linchpin of their defensive front and receiver jeremy kerley concussion will be available sunday against buffalo
both return to practice monday as do outside linebacker quinton coples who have ankle surgery a month ago
wilkerson who hurt his ankle in the fourth quarter against new england walk around the locker room without any wrap or bandage on his ankle

just a little soreness he say
the jets miss kerley against new england as their receiver drop four pass
he must complete the league 's concussion protocol before be clear to play but he say he do not foresee that as an obstacle
i 'll take care of myself kerley say
i do not want to pay for it later down the road
new punter
the jets frustrate with robert malone 's inconsistency switch punter
they sign ryan quigley who compete with malone during training camp and be release when the jets cut the roster to 75
it be a new frontier of the anti abortion movement law ban abortion at 20 week after conception contend that fetus can feel pain then
since 2010 a dozen state have enact them most recently texas
nationally a bill pass the republican dominate house of representatives in june
the science of fetal pain be highly complex
most scientist who have express view on the issue have say they believe that if fetus can feel pain the neurological wiring be not in place until later after the time when nearly all abortion occur
several scientist have do research that abortion opponent say show that fetus can feel pain at 20 week after conception
one of those scientist say he believe fetus could likely feel pain then but he add that he believe the few abortion perform then could be do in way to avoid pain
he and two other scientist say they do not think their work or current evidence provide scientific support for fetal pain law
some scientist view have evolve as more research have be do
dr. nicholas fisk a senior maternal fetal medicine specialist at royal brisbane and women 's hospital in australia say he once consider early fetal pain a major possibility after find that fetus receive blood transfusion produce increase stress hormone and blood flow to the brain and that painkiller lower those level
but dr. fisk a former president of the international fetal medicine and surgery society say neurological research have convince him that pain be not possible at all before 24 week
supporter of fetal pain law also say that surgeon use of anesthesia and painkiller when operate on fetus in the womb prove fetus feel pain
if the child who be wait for surgery can feel pain the child who be wait for abortion can also feel pain say mary spaulding balch the national right to life committee 's state policy director who pioneer fetal pain law
she do not advocate perform abortion with anesthesia or painkiller to have a painless death but rather want those abortion prevent because a member of the human family have reach a point where they be capable of feel pain
but fetal surgeon say that the drug be give for reason other than fetal pain
anesthesia be give to the mother reach the fetus say dr. scott adzick a fetal surgeon at children 's hospital of philadelphia
fetus receive muscle relaxant and narcotic
the drug be give to prevent maternal pain immobilize the fetus relax the uterus and block harmful effect of a fetus 's hormonal stress response he say
ask if fetus would feel pain without these drug dr. adzick say he do not know
dr. mark rosen who pioneer anesthesia in fetal surgery say if fetus could experience surgery relate pain it would be postoperatively because during surgery anesthesia from the mother be so strong
painkiller give to fetus would prevent postsurgical pain if it exist but the know scientific reason for them be it promote healing he say
the fetus be go to go on and develop and live
fetal pain law usually prohibit abortion at 20 week after conception about 22 week gestational age as measure by scientist from the last menstrual period since conception can not be pinpoint
by far most abortion occur before 24 week because the supreme court have saidâ they may be perform until fetus can be viable outside the womb which doctor say be around 24 week
so the law ban abortion about two week before the 24-week threshold affect very few 98.5 percent of abortion occur before 21 week accord to the guttmacher institute a research group that support abortion right
later case often involve just discover birth defect
still both side consider the law which have be challenge and block in arizona georgia and idaho broad effort to narrow abortion option and build opposition
scientist with vary view of pain development say they do not consider their work applicable to fetal pain law or the highly charge abortion debate
for example one of the main scientist whose work be cite as support for the law be dr. kanwaljeet anand a professor of pediatrics anesthesiology and neurobiology at the university of tennessee 's health science center
dr. anand say he consider fetal pain likely at 18 to 24 week
but he add that the issue of fetal pain do not have much relevance for abortion since most abortion be perform before the fetus be capable of experience pain and that for the very few abortion that occur after that time technique could be use that he believe would prevent pain
because so much about pain be undetermined most scientific discussion eventually run into theoretical territory
much research involve child or adult make implication for fetus unclear
scientist say characterize response as pain be difficult some fetal reaction be simply reflex or stress hormone
some researcher say pain sense ability depend on consciousness which may itself emerge gradually 1 2 next page

nearby be a second lab and that be where fleisig the research director at the american sports medicine institute keep the body part dead shoulder elbow and knee
these appendage sever from cadaver can be stretch until the ligament and tendon be stress enough to snap
fleisig a biomedical engineer know what an arm can handle and year of research give him the confidence to answer one of baseball 's more intriguing question be there a limit to how fast a human being can throw
his answer yes there be
and he add that limit already have be reach
oh there may be an outlier one exception here or there he say
but for major league baseball pitcher as a group of elite the top be not go to go up anymore
with better conditioning and nutrition and mechanic more pitcher will be toward that top throw at 95 or 100
but the top have top out
so 110 will not become the new 100
fleisig attribute this conclusion to the frailty of ligament and tendon already stretch to the limit by the pitching motion the final whip of which he call the fastest know human movement
when you ask about performance and velocity i end up talk about medicine and injury he say
you can not strengthen tendon and ligament per se certainly not as much as muscle
the muscle overwhelm them
and then come that snap
velocity itself be a risk factor for injury he say
mets pitcher matt harvey be the late unfortunate example to confirm fleisig 's research
harvey a 24-year old who be among the hardest throw starter in baseball learn aug. 26 that he have a partial ligament tear in his right elbow
on monday harvey meet with dr. james andrews the orthopedic surgeon who be the medical director of the institute
whether harvey opt to have surgery that would sideline him for a year a decision most likely to be make in come day will depend to a considerable degree on what andrews recommend
and whatever decision be make it seem clear that harvey have already come up against his body 's own speed limit
those inherent human limit may be bad news for those who believe record be make to be break that the fast inevitably cedes to the fast
on the other hand no one really know the record for the fast pitch ever throw
baseball may have a grand history support by well keep statistic but pitch velocity have not be a mark easy to assess perhaps until now
in 2007 major league baseball begin widespread use of the pitch f/x system from the company sportvision in conjunction with mlb advanced media by 2008
the system have be instal in all 30 major league ballpark
track software now follow the trajectory of each pitch calculate its position and velocity along the way
the speed reading be not entirely reliable until 2008 accord to graham goldbeck sportvision 's manager of data analytics and operation
but since then he say it be a very accurate speedometer
the fast pitch record by the system be 105.1 mile per hour
it be throw by cincinnati reds reliever aroldis chapman on sept. 24 2010 during an at bat by tony gwynn jr. of the san diego padres
the pitch be call a ball level the count at 2 2
i do not see it until the ball be behind me gwynn say
in fact chapman have throw 17 of the 20 fast pitch record by pitch f/x since 2008 accord to goldbeck
four of those heater come during gwynn 's seven pitch at bat which end in a strikeout
two others be throw by chapman that same night against other padres
of course the question of who ' the fast pitcher ever will draw different response from great grandpa grandpa dad and junior
likely name surface in the conversation would include walter johnson bob feller satchel paige nolan ryan randy johnson billy wagner and for real aficionado steve dalkowski 1

moscow secretary of state john kerry have just make an offhand remark about how president bashar al assad of syria could avoid a military strike and now sergey v. lavrov russia 's hard charge foreign minister be on the phone
mr. lavrov be not about to let the moment pas
what aide to mr. kerry be already try to roll back mr. lavrov seize on tell mr. kerry he would immediately go public with a russian lead proposal to dismantle the syrian chemical weapon arsenal
that prompt a sharp response from mr. kerry who warn in the 14-minute call we be not go to play game
by the time mr. kerry 's plane land back in washington the ground have shift and on saturday not a week later mr. kerry and mr. lavrov complete the plan sit by the pool at a geneva hotel
it be a pact that american arm control expert have scramble to shape and that the white house believe may be the best way to the uphold prohibition against the use of poison ga without resort to military force
but it be also one that the kremlin clearly think serve the interest of russia and the syrian government
in many way mr. lavrov 's work over the next six day represent the apex of a career largely spend try to body block what the kremlin have long view as dangerous american unilateralism
it be a job he have do so effectively that it have earn him the nickname minister nyet and senior american official include hillary rodham clinton and condoleezza rice have say they often find it infuriate to deal with him
as the diplomatic technician for his bos president vladimir v. putin mr. lavrov maneuver to hem in the united states avert a unilateral military strike and reassert russia 's role all while russia be continue to provide weapon to mr. assad and diplomatic cover for his effort to suppress an uprising
more broadly though mr. lavrov have seek to force the united states into a conversation that the kremlin hope will set a precedent establish russia 's role in world affair base not on the date cold war paradigm but rather on its own outlook which favor state sovereignty and status quo stability over the spread of western style democracy
in do so mr. lavrov rely on his long experience not just on nearly 10 year as foreign minister
he serve more than a decade as russia 's ambassador to the united nations where he develop an intricate knowledge of the working of the security council as well as deep experience in international disarmament effort include in iraq

for now he ' one of the most skilled diplomat in the world say fyodor lukyanov editor in chief of the policy journal russia in global affairs
the time of real diplomacy have come back
for mr. lavrov it be a series of event he have long prepare for
he graduate from the moscow state institute of international relations in 1972 and move to new york in 1981 to work at the united nations after brief stint in sri lanka and in moscow
at the united nations he be know for his elaborate seemingly absent minded doodling during lengthy meeting but also for a command of the issue
he be a great doodler but his mind be always spin away say charles a. duelfer who be deputy head of the united nations weapon inspector program in iraq in the 1990 and frequently meet with mr. lavrov at the united nations headquarters in new york
mr. duelfer say that mr. lavrov 's long experience with united nations inspector work to remove unconventional arm from iraq help him to quickly assess the situation in syria and to work out a detail plan with mr. kerry
he know this stuff because he live through it in iraq mr. duelfer say
he ' know what ' possible when you have independent inspector
a more cynical view analyst and western diplomat say be that mr. lavrov be after a political objective not one of disarmament use diplomatic jujitsu to buy time for the assad regime 1 2 next page

giglio italy salvage worker right the scar and discolor hull of the cruise ship costa concordia early tuesday after coax it from two granite reef it run aground on just off this tiny tourist island 20 month ago kill 32 people
as the vast hull slowly emerge during the complex 19-hour salvage operation the full extent of damage to the vessel become apparent
it look as if a giant fist have drive into the ship 's flank
ship horn blare over giglio 's tiny port to celebrate the moment and some of the island 's 1,500 resident hug salvage worker as they come ashore from what be likely to be see as a bold step toward redress some of italy 's anguish after the costa concordia the length of three football field careen into the reef on a wintry night in january 2012
this be an important visible step franco gabrielli head of italy 's civil protection agency tell reporter at 4 a.m. accompany by applause from a few resident who have stay up all night to follow the operation
he be echo by franco porcellacchia project manager for costa cruises the ship 's operator
there be no evidence so far of any impact to the environment he say
if there be debris to be remove we will do it tomorrow
on tuesday morning at a crowded news conference on giglio port italian official seem almost surprised by how precisely their calculation have work but express caution about future step to secure the vessel before it can be tow away and scrap probably in the spring
the phase to come will be just as complicated mr. porcellacchia say
nick sloane the salvage master say the operation exceed his expectation
it be nice to see that at 4 a.m. he tell reporter tuesday afternoon
mr. sloane explain that a full survey of the damage which he call substantial would be possible only after italian authorities carry out their inspection and search for the body of two people aboard the ship who be still miss
the operation leave the 951-foot ship rest on an artificial platform 90 foot below the surface with only about a third of its once sleek white line visible above water
engineer say the badly damaged starboard side would need to be weld and reinforce so that other steel chamber know as caisson and crucial to the operation to right the ship can be attach
the vessel will also need to be further secure to withstand winter weather engineer say
we will consider the operation conclude once the ship leave giglio island mr. gabrielli tell reporter acknowledge that risk remain while the wreck be at sea
we 'll carry out all the need intervention to mitigate it and allow the ship to face the next winter in secure condition he say
mr. sloane say he could hear worker jump around with relief and delight as the ship be gently lay on the platform
it be like a roller coaster he say
the righting of the vessel do not draw universal applause
i do not necessarily think that this be a great victory for italy maybe for the italian and american company involve say suzanne kmetyko 50 a tourist from austria who have visit the island for the past seven year
and the real success for the island will come only once people around the world will stop remember it for the shipwreck rather than for its natural beauty she say
a long way to go
italian news medium by contrast portray the salvage broadcast live on television and the internet as a chance for the country to revamp its image after the wreck in which the captain flee the damage ship and the evacuation be chaotic
the lead national daily corriere della sera call the shipwreck a monument to human stupidity and a humiliation for italy
it say it hop that the salvage effort would provide a new and different story for the country
it be not always clear what that story would be
as part of the concordia emerge in the late afternoon on monday stained and rusting from the water where the vessel have languish engineer have say the operation would most likely take long than initially plan
the sheer size of the concordia have create what salvage specialist call unparalleled challenge not only to right the ship but also to protect giglio island a marine sanctuary from environmental hazard
salvage worker use huge jack cable pulley and specialized equipment first to ease the vessel off its rocky perch and then to right it
the first few hour be the most uncertain as we could not establish how much the hull be wedge sergio girotto project manager with micoperi the project 's underwater construction and offshore contractor say on monday
the ship 's captain francesco schettino be schedule to go on trial this fall on charge of multiple manslaughter cause a shipwreck and abandon the vessel before everyone be safe
he have deny wrongdoing
a company official and four crew member have already plead guilty to reduced charge
salvage master and the italian authorities have prepare for complication
most of the fuel be siphon off within month of the wreck
but the vessel that once transport and entertain 4,229 people still contain chemical and diesel fuel that could leak into the pristine mediterranean water for which giglio a popular tourist spot be know

kabul afghanistan the top united nations human right official emerge from a meeting here with president hamid karzai on tuesday without hop for assurance that he would reverse his decision to pack the country 's human right commission with political appointee
the united nations high commissioner for human right navi pillay be also generally critical about progress on human right in the country say it be endanger in part because official be more focused on political concern ahead of presidential election next april
there have be some human right achievement during the past 12 year but they be fragile ms. pillay say during a news conference on tuesday at the end of a two day visit here

and many afghans be express fear that the overall human right situation be deteriorate on several front
human right activist have be particularly alarm by mr. karzai 's five new appointee to the nine member afghan independent human rights commission
none of the five be on a list propose by civic and human right group and they include a former taliban official a polarizing politician from the country 's lead fundamentalist party jamiat i islami and a police general
ms. pillay have already warn publicly that the appointment may lead to the commission be downgrade in its status internationally which could in turn lead to its international financing be cut off
this would be a very serious and regrettable setback for one of the current afghan government 's most notable achievement in the area of human right she say
ms. pillay say that in her meeting with mr. karzai she again ask him to rescind those appointment
i make convincing argument for him she say
i leave in the hope that he will revisit the matter
he do not specifically say that he would
the afghan human right commission have often anger member of the country 's political elite particularly the many former warlord with dubious human right record who hold powerful position in afghanistan 's govern institution
ms. pillay also praise mr. karzai for what she call his strong public stand against the use of torture in numerous afghan detention facility

but she also note that such torture continue to be common and that there have not be a single successful prosecution of a state employee for torture
in january 2012 the chicago bears be look for a new general manager
that search end with the hiring of phil emery a relative unknown who be the kansas city chiefs director of college scouting
emery do not make any immediate splash but one year later he make two bold decision that could have easily turn the chicago faithful against him
the bears go 10 6 in 2012 but emery choose to fire coach lovie smith
the move be not without controversy marty schottenheimer and steve mariucci have be the only coach in the last 20 year to be fire after win 10 game
bears player like smith and replace him be go to be challenge no matter whom emery hire
but emery go a step further he do not hire an aspire young offensive coordinator or the next great college coach
instead he go to the canadian football league to find marc trestman the coach of the montreal alouettes
the next decision may have be even more courageous
emery and trestman get into a public contract dispute with brian urlacher the on field face of the bears for the last decade
chicago could have re sign urlacher whose contract be expire but new management offer in urlacher 's word a lowball contract to retain him
as it turn out emery and trestman read the market correctly urlacher retire after find that no team be willing to spend big money on an age linebacker
the new leader risk alienate fan and lose the good will that new hire typically receive
but few fan seem to be spend much time these day think about whether emery should have retain smith or urlacher
that ' because the bears one of the more exciting team in the n.f.l. be 2 0
the decision by emery and trestman to fix the offense which be always smith 's blind spot have be pay off
for year the offensive line have be the team 's weak unit and emery make that a key focus of his off season
chicago 's first round pick in this year 's draft be oregon 's kyle long who be now entrenched at right guard
at left guard the bears sign matt slauson who have be a cog in one of the league 's best offensive line for year with the jets
chicago address the left tackle spot by land jermon bushrod who have be protect drew brees 's blind side for four year in new orleans
at right tackle the fifth round pick jordan mills win the job give chicago four new starter on the line
center roberto garza be the only holdover of a line that be no longer hold the team back
in 2011 and 2012 bears quarterback be sack a combine 93 time second most in the league
but jay cutler have be sack only once this season particularly impressive give that the two team the bears beat minnesota and cincinnati have defense that finish in the top seven in sack and in sack rate in 2012
the run blocking appear improve too
accord to nathan jahnke of pro football focus chicago 's average rush gain before contact in 2012 be just 2.0 yard
despite face two strong front seven the bears have average 2.3 yard before contact this year
trestman 's system seem to be do wonder for cutler too
pro football focus track how long it take after the snap for a quarterback to throw a pas be sack or scramble
accord to jahnke cutler average 2.81 second in 2011 and 2.79 in 2012
through two week in 2013 cutler have be make quick decision or find his receiver open more quickly and that average have drop to 2.57
it be not just trestman 's system and the line that be make life easy for cutler
the team finally give him a playmaking tight end
in 2011 chicago tight end caught just 25 pass for 256 yard in 2012 they catch 33 pass for just 318 yard
in both year the bears rank last in both category
one of emery 's big off season move be the acquisition of the talented but enigmatic martellus bennett
he have 10 catch for 125 yard and 3 touchdown in the team 's first two game include the winner on sunday against the vikings
that have help open thing up for the team 's all pro wide receiver brandon marshall who with 15 catch 217 yard and 2 touchdown continue to play at an elite level
how the bears season will unfold be still in question of course but it do look as if hire emery last year and trestman this year will give the team a strong foundation
cutler have complete 68.1 percent of his pass the first two week and have a 95.4 passer rating both would easily be career high if he be to maintain that pace
this year may turn into a special season for cutler in more way than one he be also just 1,863 pass yard from overtake sid luckman and become the franchise 's career leader
cutler 's comebacks jay cutler lead a fourth quarter comeback for the second week in a row the sixth time since 2002 that a quarterback have do that in both of his team 's first two game
it ' the second time for cutler who first pull off the feat with denver in 2007
the others matt schaub 2013 houston michael vick 2012 philadelphia jake delhomme 2008 carolina and alex smith 2007 san francisco
slow
go with rush nearly every team have an unsuccessful running game in week 1 there be 824 rush attempt for 2,984 yard and 18 touchdown which come out to an ugly 3.62 yard a carry across
the n.f.l. thing be only slightly better in week 2 with a 3.99 average on 833 carry for 3,322 yard and 18 touchdown
some of the main culprit be pittsburgh the giants jacksonville cleveland and miami
for the season all five team have rush for less than 125 yard and have average less than 3.5 yard a carry
touchdown bonanza eddie royal catch just 10 touchdown pass in his first five season and have only one touchdown with san diego last season
but royal already have five touchdown reception in the chargers first two game this season tie an n.f.l. record
five other player catch five touchdown pass in their team first two game marvin harrison 1999 colts daryl turner 1985 seahawks ben hawkins 1969 eagles elroy hirsch 1951 rams and bobby shaw 1950 cardinals
peyton manning have nine touchdown pass tie the record hold by charley johnson 1965 cardinals and drew brees 2009 saints
i like to think of my roomba as cute and industrious
he make noise while he clean that make me feel as if he ' communicate with me which contribute to the fact that i have assign him a sex
he exist in a liminal space between animate and inanimate but once he ' do clean my floor i do not mind put him in the closet until i need his service again he ' a rolling disc after all
robosimian a headless quadrupedal disaster response robot design by engineer at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory be a bit more useful than my roomba slightly more human look and a lot less cute the c-3po to my r2-d2
robosimian can maneuver over rubble and through narrow corridor in order to one day rescue human from peril
but its more difficult task will be form some sort of bond with the e.m.t. 's and first responder who may use it
robosimian will be more than just a tool but not quite a colleague
in the future more robot will occupy that strange gray zone do not only job that human can do but also job that require social grace
in the last decade an interdisciplinary field of research call human robot interaction have arise to study the factor that make robot work well with human and how human view their robotic counterpart
h.r.i. researcher have discover some rather surprising thing a robot 's behavior can have a big impact on its relationship with human than its design many of the rule that govern human relationship apply equally well to human robot relation and people will read emotion and motivation into a robot 's behavior that far exceed the robot 's capability
as we employ those lesson to build robot that can be better caretaker maid and emergency responder we risk further blur the once unnecessary line between tool and being
provide with the right behavioral cue human will form relationship with just about anything regardless of what it look like
even a stick can trigger our social promiscuity
in 2011 ehud sharlin a computer scientist at the university of calgary run an observational experiment to test this impulse to connect
his subject sit alone in a room with a very simple robot a long balsa wood rectangle attach to some gear control by a joystick wield human who hide from view run it through a series of predetermined movement
sharlin want to find out how much agency human would attribute to a stick
some subject try to fight the stick or talk it out of want to fight them
one woman panic complain that the stick would not stop point at her
some try to dance with it
the study find that a vast majority assume the stick have its own goal and internal thought procâ­ess
they describe the stick as bow in greeting search for hide item even purr like a contented cat
when a robot move on its own it exploit a fundamental social instinct that all human have the ability to separate thing into object like rock and tree and agent like a bug or another person
its evolutionary importance seem self evident typically kid can do this by the time they 're a year old
the distinction run deep than know something be capable of movement
nobody question the motivation of a rock roll down a hill say brian scassellati director of yale 's social robotics lab
agent on the other hand have internal state that we speculate about
the ability to distinguish between agent and object be the basis for another important human skill that scientist call cognitive empathy or theory of mind depend on whom you ask the ability to predict what other being be think and what they want by watch how they move
we make these assumption very quickly and naturally scassellati say
and it ' not new or even limit to the world of robotics
look at animation
they know the rule too
a sack of flour can look sad or angry
it ' all about how it move

harald hendrikse an analyst at nomura international in london say that take together the two month appear to have be roughly flat from a year earlier
the good news be that there be probably no more deterioration he say
clearly from a low low base we be stabilize
the bad news be that it ' not get any better either

unemployment be high in europe 12.1 percent in the 17-country euro zone generally and more than 25 percent in spain and greece
and car be see as a luxury rather than a necessity by those consumer who have access to good public transportation

jack ewing contribute report from frankfurt
it ' not worth try to persuade anyone to become vegan for a couple of very good reason one it ' a losing battle and two it ' far from certain that a diet with no animal product be best for everyone
it ' increasingly evident however that a part time vegan diet one that emphasize minimally processed plant food at the expense of everything else be the direction that will do the most to benefit human health increase animal welfare and reduce environmental impact
the remain challenge an undeniably big one be to figure out how to make such a diet which you may also call flexitarian the standard
my own diet which i call vegan
before 6 and write a book about be one way of tackle part time veganism but it be not the only way
an intelligent adaptation of the mediterranean diet one of the popular fast today feast tomorrow diet or even a so call paleo diet one that stress vegetable rather than animal product our great ancestor after all be gatherer hunter who saw meat not as routine but as an occasion to feast can put you on the right track
as can this a day of your choosing when you just go vegan
there be of course true vegan who will say that part time veganism be a little bit pregnant kind of thing that is impossible
but since the word mean a diet without animal product it can be use to describe something as part time as a meal a salad be after all a vegan meal
i be aware have have this argument dozen of time in the last few year that many full time vegan primary concern be animal welfare and that ' a different discussion
be a vegan be not my point and anyway it ' as easy to create an unhealthy full time vegan diet as it be to eat brilliantly as a part time vegan
it just take a little thought and a little will though perhaps less will than you may think at first
many cook dish that contain animal product can be and traditionally have be make without them usually out of want
the problem for most people in developed country be not a lack of opportunity to eat animal product but a superabundance
it be not as if vegetable be in short supply
yes local or organic produce be expensive and so inconveniently seasonal but if you be go to eat it now be your chance
it be not a coincidence that this column be appear in september to me the period between labor day and thanksgiving be the best time of year to cook warm enough to grill and cool enough to braise with the farmer market still an absolute paradigm of abundance
take advantage in a few month there may be little more than root vegetable apple cider and hand dye yarn
when fruit and vegetable be at their best they give you insight into how the vegan thing can work for you if only for a day
and give a moderate degree of freshness most conventional vegetable from ordinary supermarket can be make to taste good when garden go dormant
plant base meal contain more than vegetable of course stock the pantry with good grain legume nut seed oil vinegar and other classic condiment and you 're set to make an infinite number of dish that do not ruffle a single animal 's feather hide or fin
here then be some recipe for what you may call a vegan day
i do not pretend that you 're likely to eat all five in the same day or even that they have much relationship to one another but they 're each a representation of the kind of thing you may be eat at a give moment
some be simple traditional peasant food hoecake make from little but corn and water may seem ascetic until you recognize that this be polenta in a fast crunchy form fill with flavor and perfect to bury under a pile of fruit
you can jazz them up if you like a little sugar a little baking powder a little nondairy milk maybe some maple syrup and they start to resemble something far rich and more common
i happen to like the ultraminimalist version
some be elaborate and design to satisfy an open minded if devote meat eater at the big meal of the day
this ratatouille with chickpea and fennel be among the best i have ever make and bow tie with bulgur and what amount to a salad be as good at room temperature as any pasta i know
the others be creatively simple carrot candy be as much fun to eat as it be to look at broil melon be a lovely and unusual dessert
the option be infinite i love jook for breakfast as well as more conventional porridge or mush or something more modern like quinoa cook in almond milk
chop salad may have become a cliche but there may not be a better vegan lunch you may try one with a thai- or japanese flavored dressing for variety
a snack can of course be as simple as popcorn jazz up with nut and raisin
dinner
i could live on pasta with vegetable for week
you may try it if only for a day

when you grow up like that you be wary all the time you rarely get close to anyone and you do not go around have feeling where people can see them
my method of cop be my manner low visibility in and go distance

i have never consider that i could be love by anyone
when i meet denise i be to my great benefit open enough to understand that she be a person with whom i could share myself
i commit to her and to a life together

and they do it
i go to pick them up at the airport when they return and i saw denise approach from a distance this little woman in a head scarf carefully negotiate her step with her cane
when she look up saw me and smile i have that moment again that i know what i know

washington a month before a murderous rampage at the washington navy yard aaron alexis call the police in rhode island to complain that he have change hotel three time because he be be pursue by people keep him awake by send vibration through the wall
when officer come to his hotel room early on aug. 7 mr. alexis tell them that a person he have argue with at an airport in virginia have send three people to follow him and that they be harass him with a microwave machine accord to a newport r.i. police report
mr. alexis say he have hear voice speak to him through the wall flooring and ceiling the report say

i do not know why he do what he do and i will never be able to ask him why cathleen alexis say
aaron be now in a place where he can no longer do harm to anyone and for that i be glad
to the family of the victim i be so so very sorry that this happen
my heart be break
the episode in rhode island add to a grow list of question about how mr. alexis who have a history of infraction as a navy reservist mental health problem and run in with the police over gun violence gain and keep a security clearance from the defense department that give him access to military base include the navy yard where he be shoot to death by the police
time and again mr. alexis 's behavior fall below a level that would have bring a serious response like a less than honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution expert and official say
but the sheer number of episode raise question about the government 's system for vet people for security clearance include the thousand of contractor who help run the nation 's military and security system work
though the case be different the access grant mr. alexis a former navy reservist who as an independent contractor service navy computer raise question similar to those raise about another outside government contractor edward j. snowden who leak national intelligence secret
these two incident combine suggest to me a very flawed system for grant security clearance say senator susan collins republican of maine who call for a congressional investigation into the granting of security clearance to government contractor

regard an anchorless world globalist sept. 13 by roger cohen
as one who along with a great majority of the american people say enough be enough i would like to make three point
one our experience of go into a country to topple a hat dictator have not be meet with gratitude all side in the arab/muslim world hate us so we need to learn to give up that ghost
two if it ' so important for turkey or saudi arabia to get rid of president bashar al assad of syria then let them do the fighting
three we have fail to put forth any sort of meaningful or realistic geopolitical strategy
i commend my fellow americans for be far ahead of the president and the pundit on these issue
melvin vigman summit new jersey cohen be clearly on the side of the hawk
his column leave no doubt about that
to make his point he even get back to his german source to world war ii and postwar berlin but apparently not to the debacle of vietnam iraq and afghanistan
these be all failure
an intervention in syria could join the list
renaat horemans mol belgium
credibility be a prized word in international politics
country that keep their promise and enforce their red line can be count on to deter their enemy and assure their allies
nation as with human being develop reputation and those that break their pledge be impossible to trust
as such the failure of the united states to bomb syria be bind to empower iran and reinforce its quest for nuclear arm
the only problem with such assertion be that the historical record suggest that the so call credibility argument rest on a very thin intellectual rail
america 's enemy put premium on its capability rather than indication of its resolve
it be washington 's allies however that be likely to prove sensitive to its intention as oppose to its actual power
the event of the past few week have probably impact israel more so than iran
the most tragic application of the credibility argument for the united states be the vietnam war
during washington 's quarter of century involvement in southeast asia successive administration never claim that vietnam by itself be relevant for u.s. security but that the failure to stop the advance of communism there be bind to embolden the soviet union
america fight in vietnamese jungle to prove to the kremlin that once the united states draw its red line it would use all of its power to achieve its objective
in one of the irony of history the collapse of u.s. effort in vietnam be follow a decade and a half later by the demise of the soviet union
the guardian of the theocratic state be clever man accustomed to sense the subtlety of power
although cavalier in their public pronouncement and bold in term of their adventure in the middle east iran 's military man do respect america 's armada assemble on their periphery
they know well that washington be anxious to avoid a cascade of proliferation in the critical gulf region
and they know that the united states have the military power to destroy their nuclear infrastructure
it be this calculus more so than america 's reticence in syria that weigh on the mind of the mullah
give the fact that iran appreciate u.s. power how can one account for its nuclear truculence
just because tehran recognize the reality of american strength that do not mean that iran will readily acquiesce to its mandate
the clerical leader have their own version of two track policy to forestall an american attack
on the one hand they point to their deterrent capability terrorist allies such as hezbollah be emphasize and the notion of inflict damage on america 's military and diplomatic personnel be subtly stressed
at the same time iran have entangle the united states in a prolonged diplomatic process that have successfully defer a military response
iran 's diplomatic track have be complement by a charm offensive emphasize its readiness to arrive at a mutually satisfactory settlement
it be very hard for washington to justify a strike on iran give the probability of retaliation and tehran 's seem willingness to resolve the issue at the negotiating table
while not bomb syria may not have have a measurable impact on iran 's calculation it be likely to condition israel 's response to the islamic republic 's nuclear imbroglio
for israelis as with all small power measure the reliability of their superpower patron intention matter more than capability
it be not america 's actual military power but its willingness to use that power that impress its allies
what israelis have see of late be a washington that face with a violation of its red line on the use of weapon of mass destruction embrace a russian effort at the united nations security council
there be no two entity with less credibility in jerusalem on the issue of unconventional weapon than russia and the united nations
prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his hawkish adviser may yet conclude that any forceful resolution of the iran crisis require israel act alone
whatever the probability of israeli bombing iran 's facility may have be prior to the syrian crisis those number have only go up
the recent syrian melodrama indicate how little historical assessment penetrate governmental deliberation
the notion that we have to bomb damascus to impress tehran be short sighted and without much analytical underpinning
there may be ample justification for the use of force against a regime that have use chemical weapon against unarmed citizen
indeed the tragedy of the syrian civil war have long call out for a more determined international effort
however in assess the effect of the recent crisis one have to conclude that its impact will be feel more in israel than in iran

the silver maserati arrive at the diagonal the wide avenue in barcelona

watch now say the driver i 'll beat all the light except the last
there be eight set of traffic light in an 800-meter or 2,600-foot stretch
the first seven be pass while they be still green
the year be 1974
the man at the wheel be johan cruyff
and the car symbolize the way he be and be lean quicksilver fast and forever challenge the limitation around him
this wednesday evening barcelona play ajax amsterdam in the champions league
it will be the first competitive meeting of the two club that cruyff help to make great helped indeed to exhibit some of the most mellifluous style in the global game
he be bear in amsterdam and have live in barcelona for more than half his 66 year yet cruyff have vow not to be in the camp nou stadium on wednesday
i will support ajax he say on rtl television in the netherlands
i have have some difference with barã§a 's president and i will not set foot in the camp nou as long as he be there
this too be symptomatic of johan cruyff
there be his way of do thing and any other way have to be wrong
the vast majority of the 710 game he play and the 401 goal he score be for ajax or barcelona or the netherlands national team
he even choose catalonia 's team as his second club because it represent the opposition to francisco franco 's dictatorship in spain
but to cruyff life be what he could control on the field
he be bear close to the ajax stadium in the east of amsterdam his mother be a clean at the club and he be draw into the youth system there
even before rinus michels the stern trainer at ajax and later at barcelona become know as the father of total football cruyff be know for express all the skill of every position
he express them through movement and very much through his outspoken opinion
when he speak too much the coach would threaten to fine him or bad send him home
but they even michels be inspire by the beauty of cruyff 's belief that soccer need not be a sport of fix positional play or stereotypical pattern
when we watch lionel messi thrive in the barã§a team coach by pep guardiola a couple of season ago this be cruyff 's soccer
he be the coach who give guardiola his debut as a player and whose 1992 barcelona dream team set the seed for the barã§a of today
cruyff be its coach the head coach of the entire club from the academy up
guardiola be the captain of a side that feature jose maria bakero txiki begiristain gheorghe hagi michael laudrup romã¡rio hristo stoichkov and the inevitable dutch connection ronald koeman
and where ajax with cruyff the player triumph in the old european cup he later coach barcelona to the same title
even today the catalan dutch connection be maintain
frank de boer the current ajax coach play for barcelona from 1999 to 2003
economics have determine that the modern ajax be no longer as flamboyant or as competitive as the one that cruyff lead to european glory
it still have its youth system but barã§a 's be big better and able to augment its graduate with world class import
neymar cost barcelona the better part of â¬100 million about $ 134 million once the transfer payment to his brazilian club santos and his salary over the length of his contract be take into account
cruyff 's transfer fee when he leave ajax for barcelona be also in the ten of million but in peseta the former spanish currency and worth about $ 2 million
it be another time another valuation and even the maserati be then around $ 10,000 worth of extravagance
what have not change in cruyff 's eye be that soccer be just a game
drive by commerce but it be still a game that in his case come from the street and from his vision
neymar and messi may be aspire cruyff like figure license to thrill
but one of cruyff 's difference with barcelona 's president sandro rosell be that the dutchman do not believe the team need neymar
cruyff 's opinion state on tv and in newspaper column be that neymar and messi duplicate rather than complement each other
the sign of the past few week have suggest otherwise although neymar have go to great length to forego his own scoring opportunity while he try to set up messi
that may be the brazilian 's way of show he know his place in the pecking order in catalonia and that he be bid time before seek a leading role
ajax alas come without any comparable star
it have a promising young playmaker the dane christian eriksen but it sell him this month to tottenham hotspur for about $ 18 million
that money be lifeblood to ajax but since eriksen leave the team have lose its rhythm
if messi have see image of the way we play at the weekend say coach de boer i doubt he ' too concerned
cruyff who have fall out with the board member run both his former club have become the great outsider
he think rosell the president of barã§a be too mercenary
and he be blame the coach for the way that ajax struggle
just because someone have a drive license cruyff say of de boer do n't mean he be capable of drive a formula one car
straight to the point like his straight line drive 39 year ago in barcelona

cardiff wales donizetti never think of his three opera about tudor queen as a trilogy and scarcely anyone else do either until the soprano beverly sills sing them at the new york city opera in the 1970
each with a libretto by a different author they be premier over a seven year period 1830 1837 in different italian theater with different singer as the royal protagonist giuditta pasta anna bolena maria malibran maria stuarda and giuseppina ronzi de begnis elizabeth i in roberto devereux
the story familiar from both history and literary fabrication be far apart chronologically
yet each culminate in an execution anne boleyn 's in 1536 at the behest of her husband henry viii for among other thing alleged infidelity mary stuart ' in 1587 because of the threat she pose to elizabeth i ' rule and robert devereux 's in 1601 for treason
at the heart of each plot be one or more love triangle whether root in reality or invent
authentic or not the tudor trilogy be happily with us for these be fine opera
choose a favorite be not easy mine tend to be the one i have encounter most recently in a convincing performance
as with wagner 's ring opera company often mount the individual opera gradually but the intrepid welsh national opera now in its third season under the note stage director david pountney 's leadership be currently introduce them in new production at the wales millennium center within the space of just a month
anna bolena and maria stuarda be now in repertory with roberto devereux to follow on oct. 7
the ambitious schedule impose challenge on the company 's production and musical capability from which it do not emerge unscathed but the burden be lessen by have the same set serve for all three opera a functional black box design by madeleine boyd
she also design the prevailingly black costume which have detail suggestive both of tudor and of more recent time
in addition responsibility be share by two director and two conductor alessandro talevi and daniele rustioni for anna bolena and roberto devereux rudolf frey and graeme jenkins for maria stuarda
only two character elizabeth i and her stern adviser william cecil appear in more than one opera
but mr. talevi 's powerful staging ingeniously allow elizabeth to appear in all three opera by show her mother anne boleyn in the aftermath of give birth to the future monarch at the start of anna bolena
not only do this introduce us to the woman whose dictate dominate the succeed opera but the issue of elizabeth 's illegitimate birth be bring to the fore
prior to her marriage anne be betroth to henry percy news of which enrage the operatic henry by cast doubt on the legitimacy of his marriage to anne and as he allude to in word that be easily overlook also reflect adversely on his infant daughter
it all constitute telling preparation for the famous if fictionalized confrontation between the two queen in maria stuarda when mary hold as elizabeth 's prisoner and torment beyond endurance by her insult denounce her publicly as the sully daughter of boleyn and a vile bastard
sadly mr. frey 's staging fall short of do that opera justice
within the black box set another box serve as mary 's prison cell elizabeth appear in it dejectedly at the end thereby draw a parallel between the two queen
but the device do not help the action which be mar elsewhere by such distraction as mary smoke a cigarette in her entrance aria and an embarrassing foot washing episode during the moving scene in which mary 's supporter george talbot receive her confession accord to catholic tenet
musically too anna bolena come off better
the soprano serena farnocchia may not be the most charismatic of annas but her singing be consistently attractive and in face rejection death and temporary madness she deal with anna 's overwhelming final scene grippingly sometimes couch in elizabeth 's crib 1 2 next page
london
the london theater be in a fearsome mood these day whether on large stage or small
indeed during a recent week of playgoing i learn that goodness be nothing more than another word for cowardice that same sex affection be likely to end in something far bloody than tear and that even a pet guinea pig be not immune from the brutishness course through the capital 's stage of late
the best know of these scenario have arrive courtesy of christopher marlowe a contemporary of shakespeare they be bear the same year who may not quite possess his colleague 's unequivocal lyricism but who also know a thing or two about the price pay for kingship go awry
edward ii remain one of marlowe 's best know text and it be often pair in conversation and sometimes in performance with richard ii shakespeare 's eternally rhapsodic yet mournful history play
but while the royal shakespeare company prime richard ii for a new production later this fall the national have get in first with an edward ii that be sure to divide spectator on every front but one the superb performance of the fast ascend actor john heffernan in the title role
in fact the modish approach take by the director joe hill gibbins mark his national debut wo not surprise those familiar with his esteemed track record at the young vic where mr. hill gibbins direct two separate account of the changeling the jacobean tragedy that occupy much the same take no prisoner landscape as edward ii.
but whereas that staging place the audience behind net and allow the actor as require to cover one another with vary kind of glop chocolate jam
his edward blur the distinction between theater and film by present sizable swath of the action on screen that flank the olivier auditorium
sometimes the conceit make perfect sense
in a narrative rife with backstairs intrigue why not grant us access to the going on backstage
at other time it feel like a distraction too far
it ' difficult to argue too much however with a tactic that keep playgoer apprise at every turn of mr. heffernan 's keenly sensitize portrayal edward 's downward spiral make doubly plain by scene title inform us of the grim trajectory of the piece as it be happen
even act behind a beard in what must be the most hirsute production in memory the actor awaken us to edward 's grievous surrender to the sleep deprived torment that soon after lead to his gruesome demise
a benchmark work in the canon of gay themed drama edward ii spend much of its first half obsess about the banishment of edward 's lowly beloved gaveston who be no sooner expel from view than the king be demand his return
play what amount to a human yo yo the london base american actor kyle soller get to act in his own accent a clever way of separate gaveston out from the array of noble and the like who have no time for him
mr. soller be an olivier nominee this past spring for his west end performance in eugene o'neill 's long day 's journey into night
mr. soller 's various entrance also help lend an intimacy to the large of the national 's three venue while presumably function as their own aerobics class
this be the elizabethan theater at once juiced up and in your face
traditionalist will be dismay but the rapt matinee crowd among whom i sit one recent afternoon take it in their stride
across town at the royal court the primary theater for new writing have get its new season off to a scarcely less contentious start
the ritual slaughter of gorge mastromas gorge in this instance be pronounce as if it be george spring from the febrile imagination of dennis kelly the british playwright who win a tony in june for his book for the musical matilda

mr. coronato say they look into any financial incentive people may have have to set a fire but he decline to provide any detail on what they learn
instead he focus on the absence of any evidence that the source of the fire could have be anything other than a wiring problem
he say the wiring may have be in place for decade and could have fail on its own
but he say it have be submerge during the hurricane and because it be inaccessible obviously have not be inspect since the storm
fail to check the wire may not have be wise he say but it ' certainly not criminal in nature

the census report find that median household income adjust for inflation be $ 51,017 in 2012 down about 9 percent from an inflation adjust peak of $ 56,080 in 1999 mostly as a result of the long and most damaging recession since the depression

the government 's authoritative annual report on income poverty and health insurance release tuesday underscore that the economic recovery have largely fail to reach the poor and the middle class even as the unemployment rate continue to sink and growth have return
government program remain a lifeline for million
unemployment insurance whose eligibility the federal government expand in response to the downturn keep 1.7 million people out of poverty last year
food stamp if count as income would have keep out four million
since the recession end in 2009 income gain have accrue almost entirely to the top earner the census bureau find
the top 5 percent of earner household make more than about $ 191,000 a year have recover their loss and earn about as much in 2012 as they do before the recession
but those in the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution be generally make considerably less than they have be hit by high rate of unemployment and nonexistent wage growth
moreover economist believe that the report understate the degree of income inequality in the united states by not include among other thing earnings from capital gain make on rise stock price
in one glimmer of improvement the number of man work full time year round with earnings increase by one million from 2011 to 2012 to a total of 59 million
still the labor market continue to look weak in particular for less educate and low income man
the labor force participation rate of man have fall steadily for the past 60 year
in no small part that be because the median earnings of man work full time have not increase in real term since the early 1970s
for woman the earnings stall start about a decade ago when the gender pay gap stop close

for non hispanic white it be about $ 57,000 while the typical hispanic household have an income of $ 39,000 and black be at $ 33,300 1 2 next page

we know all the work we have do to get to this point and this be the final project up here
we have get a lot of guy that have put together some good season and we 're head in the right direction
the royals may run out of time in their playoff push the field be crowd and just 11 game remain
but if they make it the royals could be tough to knock out
they would have momentum and they do a few thing very well
the royals be a team of extreme

their pitching staff have the best earn run average in the league at 3.50 and a sturdy rebuilt rotation have keep the bullpen rest and dominant

then people wo not have to choose between have a nice house in the suburb with a long commute and living in an overpriced condo near or in a city
they will live better spend more time with their child and be more productive when they do not have a costly stressful commute every day
and they can work just as closely with their colleague as they can when they 're in the same office

it be hard to dream up a more auspicious series of event for pat quinn illinois 's governor whose re election hope have appear shaky enough that a line of fellow democrats have be salivate over his job for age
in july lisa madigan the illinois attorney general and daughter of the powerful longtime state house speaker say that she have decide against running for governor cite her father 's role as a reason
in august kwame raoul who replace barack obama in this state 's senate say he have decide against it too
and on tuesday william m. daley a member of one of chicago 's most influential democratic family who say just month ago that he be run for governor announce that he have change his mind
i 've lose sleep to be frank with you and be struggle over the last couple of week as to whether or not what ' need i can provide over a long period mr. daley who have be deeply critical of mr. quinn and the state 's miserable financial circumstance say in a sometimes emotional news conference here
it ' not about a campaign of six month or 14 month
it really be about a minimum of five to nine year to begin to straighten out this state
the voter of illinois deserve someone who ' go to commit not just to a tough campaign but to the more difficult job of govern this state a state which deserve better say mr. daley allude in part to illinois 's vastly underfinanced pension system
as i have survey both the rigor of this campaign and the enormity of the challenge of fix these problem i have conclude that i can not commit to what the voter may need
the abrupt choice from a veteran of the state 's political world be a remarkable turn of fortune for mr. quinn sweep out at least for now well know opponent from a democratic primary next march
some political expert here point to the late development as only mr. quinn 's most recent stroke of luck note that mr. quinn who be once see more as a well mean gadfly than a political heavyweight have ascend to governor in the first place because rod r. blagojevich who be in his second term as governor be arrest on corruption charge in 2008
mr. quinn be the lieutenant governor at the time
still mr. quinn 's fortune will be test in 2014
four well know republican candidate have line up to run for governor include bill brady a state senator whom mr. quinn defeat in a close election in 2010
democrats control the governor 's office and both chamber of the state legislature but republicans have win statewide office here in year past largely with some combination of conservative fiscal view and moderate social one
others in the republican field who want mr. quinn 's job dan rutherford the state treasurer bruce rauner a wealthy business executive and kirk dillard a state senator who run for governor in 2010
but in that there ' another lucky break for quinn say dick simpson a political scientist and former chicago city council member
the republicans will have a primary to go through and whoever come out be likely to be tarnish
perhaps mr. quinn 's big challenge be in springfield the state capital where lawmaker have argue over how best to repair the state 's pension system and its grow shortfall now estimate at about $ 100 billion
tension over the impasse bubble over when mr. quinn say he be withhold lawmaker paycheck until they fix the pension system and lawmaker sue him in a case expect to be hear in court on wednesday
as mr. daley the son of one former chicago mayor and the brother of another as well as a former white house chief of staff to president obama and commerce secretary under president bill clinton depart the race he say he plan to return to the private sector
he say he would return campaign contribution
and he pointedly do not endorse mr. quinn
he say he still believe he could have beat mr. quinn
but the state 's challenge after the election appear more daunting
it ' go to take a governor quite a while to help this state dig out of the mess which it be in mr. daley say
beijing if you want to lean in in chinese you take one step forward
that ' how the title of sheryl sandberg 's contemporary feminist manifesto lean in woman work and the will to lead have be translate here
and you do it with gusto judge from the reaction of about a thousand student and businesspeople at two event in beijing last week where ms. sandberg the chief operating officer of facebook promote the new chinese version of her book
people be hungry for it allison ye co founder of a lean in circle in beijing a small group of peer who meet to talk about the book 's message say of the response to ms. sandberg 's main point overcome your internal barrier to success and get to the deal table
the enthusiasm suggest an intriguing possibility as the chinese government strike anew against freedom of speech detain even mild mannered democracy activist civil society advocate and popular public opinion leader may there be a feminist revolution in china before there be a democratic one
in recent week lean in circle have set up in half a dozen university in the capital include tsinghua university peking university and the communication university of china member say in interview
i feel like this be a new stage for us say ms. ye 27 who work for a chinese company
i can not speak for everyone but i feel that despite the cultural difference between america and china the method be universal
i feel it ' true that you can take responsibility for yourself it ' a good thing and then you can change your situation
of course feminism in china predate ms. sandberg 's book
but it have gain new focus with the arrival of the movement here
ms. ye 's conversion begin in march when she chance online upon a ted talk give by ms. sandberg in 2010 call why we have too few woman leader
she be hook
i be shake she say
i say to myself who be she
everything she say be wow
so true
i watch it three time in one day
then i buy an english copy of her book with a friend we say why do not we open a lean in circle
we want to support chinese woman and help them set up their own circle word spread include to 21-year old carrie huang
two week ago ms. huang set up a circle at the prestigious renmin university of china where she study finance
my friend and i we all feel that we do that we underestimate ourselves she say in an interview
it have to do with our education and background
our parent tell us you be girl get yourself a stable life and do not have too much ambition
many young chinese woman especially in city be highly educated and begin to overtake man in some college subject ms. huang say there be 16 woman and 7 man in her finance class but deep cultural message hold them back
we fear we be not good enough
we lack confidence ms. huang say add that many woman in china prioritize their boyfriend or husband goal
what we need be the courage to try different thing she say
it ' about discover what you want to do
parent have wish for us and it ' hard to change
at their weekly meeting ms. huang say she and her half dozen circlers some of whom be male plan to raise specific question
we want to talk about strong woman and how man see them as aggressive or bossy
not everyone like the chinese translation of the book 's impactful english title
some snicker that it be similar to the message find in man 's public urinal to please take a step forward
ms. huang say it do not quite catch the psychological nature of ms. sandberg 's message
it make it sound like it ' about overcome external obstacle take a step forward she say

but actually this book be about overcome your inner obstacle
either way experience chinese feminist have welcome it
i think her message be definitely an empower one call for more woman to get to the deal table say feng yuan an activist for gender right and equality
still it be only one response to the daunting cultural and institutional hurdle face woman in china ms. feng say
i do not think the personal approach can change the fundamentally unequal gender structure she say
but in term of a woman 's individual situation it ' useful because a lot of woman fear feminism that kind of collective call
a personal message be workable
it may not work for uneducated poor or rural woman ms. feng say an echo of criticism that the book have receive in the west
her target audience be educated and ambitious woman and these woman be able to mobilize resource to achieve their goal she say
but we should not be too critical she say
you can not expect her to have a formula for all woman 's right
even the very well educated need this and they should have it
ms. huang and ms. ye say china be ready for lean in regardless of the tight political atmosphere
i think everything we do in the lean in circle be positive ms. huang say
we 're not in violation of anything so we should be o.k.
ms. ye say i 've think about it because i be very careful
i think if the government allow sheryl sandberg to promote her book then the government support the content of her book
add some irony to the situation facebook be bar from china 's censor internet
a lot of what she say fit with the chinese government 's message ms. ye say
i think as long as we stay within a circle it ' not threaten at all
the obama administration announce on tuesday that it be extend minimum wage and overtime protection to the nation 's nearly two million home care worker
advocate for low wage worker have push for this change assert that home care worker who care for elderly and disabled americans be wrongly classify into the same companionship service category as baby sitter a group that be exempt from minimum wage and overtime coverage
under the new rule home care aide unlike baby sitter would be cover under the fair labor standards act the nation 's main wage and hour law
in an unusual move the administration say the new regulation would not take effect until jan. 1 2015 even though regulation often take effect 60 day after be issue
the delay until 2015 be to give family that use these attendant as well as state medicaid program time to prepare
industry expert say most of these worker be already pay at least the minimum wage but many do not receive a time and a half overtime premium when they work more than 40 hour a week
about 20 state exclude home care worker from their wage and hour law
we think the worker provide this critical work should be receive the same basic protection and coverage as the vast majority of american worker say laura fortman deputy administrator of the labor department 's wage and hour division
we 've see a lot of turnover in this industry and we believe that this new rule will stabilize the work force
the nation 's home care worker usually earn $ 8.50 to $ 12 an hour accord to industry official
the federal minimum wage be $ 7.25 an hour
accord to the obama administration almost 40 percent of aide receive government benefit like food stamp and medicaid
ninety two percent of these worker be female almost 30 percent be black and 12 percent be hispanic
labor secretary thomas e. perez say in a statement today we be take an important step toward guarantee that these professional receive the wage protection they deserve while protect the right of individual to live at home
but industry official say the change would cause increase in medicaid and medicare spending raise cost for family that use such service and result in few job for home care worker
andrea l. devoti chairman of the national association for home care and hospice say the new rule will mean that people will receive less care
she say the high cost result from the new rule would lead many people to hire home care aide part time rather than full time
caregiver will in the end receive less pay she say
the newly issue rule be also criticize by representative john kline a minnesota republican who be chairman of the house education and the work force committee and representative tim walberg a michigan republican who head the panel 's subcommittee on work force protection
they say it not only would raise cost but would limit access to in home care for vulnerable americans
they add face with high cost some individual will have no choice but to leave their home and enter institutional living
long term nursing home care much of which be pay by medicaid be generally more expensive than home care
ms. fortman of the administration 's wage and hour division say 15 state now provide overtime and minimum wage protection to home care aide
we have not see any evidence that it have result in job loss or any serious negative impact for the worker or for the people use the service she say
the administration announce the change 21 month after first propose the rule and after have receive 26,000 public comment many of them from for profit home care agency that oppose it
many labor advocate criticize the administration for take so long to issue its final rule but labor department official say review the comment and hold related public meeting take time
the federal government say six million of the 40 million americans old than 65 need some form of daily assistance to live outside a nursing home
federal official estimate that the number will double to 12 million by 2030
under the new rule any home care aide hire through home care company or other third party agency can not be exempt from minimum wage and overtime coverage
the exemption for aide who mainly provide companionship service define as fellowship and protection for an elderly person or person with an illness injury or disability who require assistance be limit to the individual family or household use the service
if an aide or companion provide care that exceed 20 percent of the total hour she work each week then the worker be to receive minimum wage and overtime protection
the new rule define care as assist with the activity of daily living like dress groom feed or bathing and assist with instrumental activity of daily living like meal preparation drive light housework manage finance and assist with the physical taking of medication
the companionship exemption will not apply if the aide or companion provide medically relate service that be typically perform by train personnel like nurse or certify nursing assistant
live in domestic service worker who reside in the employer 's home and be employ by an individual family or household be exempt from overtime pay although they must be pay at least the federal minimum wage for all hour work
washington as the white house and congress careen toward another fiscal showdown the nonpartisan congressional budget office warn on tuesday that president obama and lawmaker have be cut the wrong kind of federal spending as they try to avoid the unsustainable buildup of debt that be project in the come decade
annual federal deficit will continue to fall in the short term the budget office report in its yearly long term outlook because of the recent spending cut in military and domestic program and rise tax collection in a recover economy
the report project the deficit in 2015 to be equal to 2.1 percent of the economy 's output or just one fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in 2009
but start in 2016 deficit be project to rise again as more baby boomer begin draw from medicare medicaid and social security the fast grow entitlement program which democrats and republicans can not agree on how to rein in
the accumulate federal debt which average 38 percent of the gross domestic product for the 40 year before the 2008 financial crisis would rise from 73 percent of the g.d.p. now above what most economist consider an optimum level to at least 100 percent in 2038
budget expert have be warn since at least the reagan era that in the early 21st century age baby boomer will drive entitlement spending chiefly for medicare and medicaid and to a less degree for social security to level that will crowd out all other military and domestic spending
interest on the debt will also be a major and grow expense
what be different now be that the republican control house and the white house have be on a two year run of deficit reduction that have result because of their inability to agree on entitlement reduction and high tax revenue in deepen cut in the budget area that be not responsible for the projection of mount debt
those discretionary spending program which include thing as vary as pentagon weapon purchase air traffic control science and research education and national park be be squeeze even as entitlement spending grow automatically
the budget office say that by 2023 the annual deficit would rise to an estimate 3.5 percent of the g.d.p. which be just beyond the level that many economist consider sustainable in a grow economy
by 2038 it would be 6.5 percent
under a nine year plan start in the 2011 fiscal year discretionary spending be already be reduce annually
but the across the board sequester that take effect in march when republicans and mr. obama could not agree on alternative deficit reduction have par domestic and military program further result in increase layoff furlough and service cutback

london sophie hulme 's new muse be the frog
for spring/summ 2014 the british handbag designer be inspire by the plastic jumping frog find in christmas cracker and the dazzling color and pattern of deadly frog native to the rain forest
that may not sound like the beginning of a collection from a serious fashion business but ms. hulme 's handbag with their quirky charm and staunchly anti logo stance have quickly gain an international following
her label introduce in january 2009 include ready to wear accessory and jewelry but it be her handbag that she be best know for and that be see increase demand
in the last year her full time staff have grow from one person to 11 give the london bear designer the capacity to make the leap from sell to niche boutique to stock international heavyweight like selfridges harvey nichols barneys saks lane crawford tsum and net a porter
the bag themselves be minimalist but instantly recognizable by their distinctive gold color hardware and tongue in cheek brass charm
design have include a referee 's whistle a bubble blow wand and a fish and chip fork
ms. hulme 's success lie in her ability to combine a
slick international aesthetic with an exaggerated british style say sasha sarokin net a porter 's international accessory manager
the online retailer first stock ms. hulme 's tote and shoulder bag in early 2012 and they have show a sharp and unfaltering upward swing in sale across all territory she say
she be one of the first new handbag brand that i have see to take a supremely sophisticated aesthetic and sell it at a price point that be jaw droppingly low ms. sarokin continue
when the average designer handbag cost $ 1,500 or more ms. hulme 's design be $ 450 to $ 950 a range that reflect a consider business strategy
i give price a lot of thought she say
i think there be a big gap where brand like miu miu and mulberry use to sit
she source material and hardware from italy but produce the handbag in hungary to keep price down
there be definitely a void for premium contemporary designer handbag that be high in design element at a competitive price point say irene yu divisional merchandise manager of footwear and handbag at pedder group whose company stock ms. hulme 's handbag at its stand alone
on pedder accessory store across asia as well as in the accessory department that the company operate at lane crawford and joyce
british designer have a special talent in design handbag that stand out but also feel like instant update classic say maria dueã±as jacobs accessory director of elle magazine in the united states

designer such as anya hindmarch emma hill and charlotte olympia have a special way of balance luxury and charm without compromise on quality and sophie fit with this approach
in 2012 mulberry 's chief executive bruno guillon a former managing director at hermã¨s oversee a price increase of the brand 's exist handbag style and the introduction of more bag price at more than $ 1,500
while the mulberry brand 's bag style like the bayswater and alexa continue to be popular the decision to shift away from affordable luxury clearly have make mulberry 's product less accessible to the average consumer
ms. sarokin say that ms. hulme 's brand do not simply fill the gap leave by mulberry 's shift in strategy
i think sophie 's brand sit next to mulberry rather than replace it she ' more edgy
the mum and daughter would both wear a bayswater but with sophie it ' more likely the daughter who will buy into the brand she say
unlike mulberry ms. hulme have take an understated approach to marketing partly because of financial necessity and partly because taste have change
she have not stag runway show because she say i want people to buy my design because the product be beautiful and timeless object in their own right and not because they buy into a vision that only exist on the catwalk
the it bag a term coin in the 1990 when logo dictate desirability have be overtake in recent year
ms. yu say that her customer prioritize an emphasis on the quality of leather design and functionality over the logo
even when it come to brand with champion logo like gucci and fendi it ' the logo free version that sell better ms. sarokin say add this be a trend that be happen internationally include place like russia and the far east
a new generation of british handbag label have a similar approach include fleet ilya danielle foster and golden lane as do international label like kara and mansur gavriel
ms. hulme say that she be aware of the danger that the middle price market could become saturated and she have respond by sell through premium retailer and by sharpen focus on her ready to wear collection which have increase to 110 piece for spring 2014 from 30 piece for spring 2013
she also have be contemplate new category and will be introduce sunglass next year
the handbag be important but they can not be everything ms. hulme say
the brand i admire have a clear vision that work across category
i just need to take it slowly so that i get it right
in 1987 shortly after i turn 8 i begin to lobby my parent for a chance to play tackle football
my father be the coach of a high school freshman team so in a way i have be raise around the game
because of my age my parent have reservation but they agree to attend an open house with the man who would be coach the pop warner team
afterward my parent still be not convince
what persuade them
accord to my father i walk to the car in tear head down mumble about how i would never get to play football
two month later i be experience drill like bull in the ring in which a player be surround by teammate who repeatedly rush at him
crack skull as they use to say
it be tackle football
and i love it
for much of my playing career most parent with young child who play football be most interested in my workout regimen and what supplement i be take
those conversation have shift significantly in the last few year
now the most common question by far be would you let your son play football
my response be usually a resounding no
right around the time those question start i develop a deep love hate relationship with the game
i love play on sundays
i love the paycheck
i love the guy in the locker room
but i hat what football be do to so many people around me and i hat what it be probably do to me
there seem to be red flag everywhere and even if i could not state with certainty that the game cause each and every ailment that so many of my friend be experience the evidence be mount quickly
i find myself receive e mail after e mail from people presumably motivate by keyword search for football concussion trauma disease
every new study draw a correlation between head injury and postcareer brain disease would find its way to my in box almost daily
combine that with phone call from former teammate who be struggle and the headline of yet another fall former player and i begin to hate the game
but be this merely an emotional reaction and not necessarily an accurate reflection of an otherwise incredible football journey that span decade
perhaps
first of all i do not even have a son so it be probably a bit ridiculous for me to speculate
i realize there be girl who play football but my daughter do not have any interest and i have no idea how i would respond to an 8-year old boy beg me to play this game
second football give me so much
how can i bash a game that produce so many friendship pay for part of my education and help me become comfortable financially
and third football be safe than it have ever be right
right
i honestly have no idea how to answer that question
sure training camp be easy than it use to be and everyone be smart about limit in practice contact
but once the game start football be football
and nothing be ever go to change that unless you drastically change the game
i be no expert in physic but there ' no doubt n.f.l. player be big faster and strong than they have ever be
as a result there be more velocity at the point of contact than there have ever be
i hate to say it but no head up campaign or the threat of a penalty or a fine will reduce football 's inherent violence
the late dark reminder come monday when a 16-year old high school player from brocton n.y. die after a helmet to helmet hit in a game friday night
certainly there be lesson to be learn from play football about toughness battle through adversity and teamwork
but i do not think football be the only way to teach those
i have numerous friend who never play football but who have battle through fail bar exam medical residency and struggle business and who be just as successful as i be
in truth they be probably a lot more well adjust well balanced and better position to navigate life 's speed bump than i will ever be
maybe they never have to push through pain and mask injury the way i have but be that really a virtue
still now that i be retire from football i know now more than ever that i absolutely love play the game
and now i actually get pay to talk about football on television
imagine the hypocrisy
here i be question whether child should be play the game at all and i be basically sell the game to child watch at home
there ' certainly some internal conflict with that
and just because football work out well for me that do not mean it will work out well for everyone
the odds be just too daunting
so maybe the more appropriate question be if i could do it all over again would i
the answer absolutely
without hesitation
i recently ask my parent the same question separately know what you know now
would you have say yes after that meeting over 25 year ago
my mother without hesitation no it ' just not worth the risk
we have love be on this journey with you and it ' bring us so much joy but i would rather see you live a long and healthy life

my father the former football coach after a long hesitation yes but i would not let you start so soon
he add football be not for everyone scott
he ' right
it ' not for everyone
but it be definitely for me
and it be definitely for a lot of other people too
so just because i be tear about the game it ' not my responsibility to make other parent decision for them
but i do feel an obligation to inform them
i be a former player now and concerned parent continue to ask me scott would you let your son play football
and how do i respond
i 'm just glad i have three daughter and will never have that conversation

the agency say it be study the applicable law with the justice department
but it be urge same sex couple to apply for benefit anyway even if they live in a state that do not recognize their marriage
what ' more the agency also be invite application not just from those in same sex marriage but also those in other legal same sex relationship like civil union or register domestic partnership
apply as soon as possible be important because if you be ultimately find eligible you can get benefit retroactive to your filing date
in the come week and month we will develop and implement additional policy and processing instruction the message say
if you be in a same sex marriage or other legal same sex relationship even if you live in a state that prohibit same sex marriage we encourage you to apply right away
that ' huge say mary bonauto civil right project director with the gay lesbian advocates defenders glad in boston
social security offer a range of financial benefit for spouse and family
you can file for retirement benefit base on your spouse 's work record for instance which entitle you to more money if your spouse earn more than you or to delay tap your own benefit
you can also receive survive spouse benefit after your spouse die
for example you can receive a one time payment of $ 255
and you can get your deceased spouse 's high retirement payout instead of your own
the social security administration 's web site say it be now process some spousal retirement claim and pay them when due
if you and your spouse live in a state where same sex marriage be sanction and you meet other criterion see below the application should be straightforward
an unresolved question however be whether couple who be legally marry in one state but move to another state that do not recognize gay marriage can get the same benefit
that ' because the social security administration currently use a place of residence standard in decide spousal benefit
susan sommer senior counsel with the gay right group lambda legal say social security have instruct its staff to accept and hold such application pending further legal clarification
we 're await guidance and we 're really hopeful she say
the agency also be hold other type of application for now like those for survivor benefit when one spouse die
however ms. bonauto say she be encourage by the case of 83-year old herb burtis a musician and voice teacher in western massachusetts
mr. burtis have apply for survivor benefit after his husband die in 2008
they marry in 2004 when massachusetts legalize same sex marriage
his late husband 's monthly retirement benefit be $ 700 high because he have earn more than mr. burtis and mr. burtis file a claim for the extra payment
his application be initially deny
but he become a plaintiff in a lawsuit that successfully challenge the defense of marriage act or doma which be strike down in june by the united states supreme court
he be now get the extra money and also receive a lump sum payment for the last five year
ms. bonauto say there be every reason to expect that the agency would eventually process and pay survivor benefit to other eligible same sex applicant
here be some question to consider
â how do i know if i be eligible for benefit
you must meet certain criterion
for instance to receive spousal retirement benefit you generally must be at least 62 and have be marry for at least 12 month for the survivor 's benefit you must be at least 60 and have be marry for nine month
if you meet age and duration requirement ms. bonauto say you should apply for benefit even in the face of other uncertainty
â

rio de janeiro brazil 's president dilma rousseff say tuesday that she be postpone a state visit to the united states deliver a sharp rebuke to the obama administration over revelation that the national security agency have spy on her her inner circle of top aide and brazil 's large company the oil giant petrobras
the move by ms. rousseff show how the disclosure of united states surveillance practice by edward j. snowden the former n.s.a. contractor be aggravate washington 's tie with an array of nation include european allies like germany
in the case of brazil latin america 's large nation the move to effectively suspend a state visit to the united states a remarkably rare decision in the annals of diplomacy threaten to unravel year of washington 's effort to recognize brazil 's rise profile in the develop world and blunt the grow influence of china which have surpass the united states as brazil 's top trading partner
president obama speak with ms. rousseff by telephone for 20 minute on monday night but fail to persuade her to go through with the visit which have be schedule for late october
a series of news report about n.s.a. spy in brazil have clearly irk ms. rousseff in recent week and her government demand a full explanation from washington
vice president joseph r. biden jr. have call ms. rousseff to try to ease tension over the spying revelation and secretary of state john kerry travel to brazil to discuss the matter with official in brasã­lia publicly criticize his explanation as unsatisfactory
susan e. rice mr. obama 's national security adviser say last week that report about the n.s.a. 's activity in brazil have raise legitimate question a statement fall short of brazil 's expectation
washington do not do contrition very well say julia e. sweig director for latin american study at the council on foreign relations emphasize how the relationship between united states and brazil be still not strong enough to withstand the turmoil over the n.s.a. revelation
the white house insist in a statement on tuesday that the broad relationship between brazil and the united states should not be overshadow by a single bilateral issue no matter how important or challenge the issue may be

for that reason the statement say mr. obama and ms. rousseff agree to postpone the visit to an undetermined time
in addition to their telephone conversation on monday night ms. rousseff and mr. obama have discuss the n.s.a. revelation during the meeting of group of 20 leader in st. petersburg russia this month the white house point out
the president have say that he understand and regret the concern that disclosure of alleged u.s. intelligence activity have generate in brazil and make clear that he be commit to work together with president rousseff and her government in diplomatic channel to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship the statement say
the white house also say that a broad review of the american intelligence posture would take several month to complete and that the leader have agree that the visit should be delay until the spying issue be resolve
meanwhile while commerce be still thrive between brazil and the united states business leader and trade expert in both country be try to gauge how put the visit off would affect effort to bolster tie
it ' simply disappointing to see this turn in policy say christian lohbauer a political scientist at the university of sã£o paulo who have represent brazilian exporter of orange juice

the diplomatic agenda should be focus on what ' practical for both nation which in brazil 's case be develop its economy through strong relation with a country like the united states
but even before ms. rousseff 's announcement expectation be low for the concrete result of the state visit
no major trade agreement be anticipate and washington have refrain from explicitly support brazil 's bid for a permanent seat on the united nations security council as mr. obama do for india in 2010
ahead of 2014 election ms. rousseff stand to gain among some element within the govern workers party by meet their demand for a strong response on the spying issue but political analyst here point out that brazil 's move be still relatively mild and avoid the expulsion of united states diplomat or limit on investment by american company
it ' a friction point in relation but not a breakup say geraldo zahran a specialist on brazil 's tie with the united states at pontifical catholic university in sã£o paulo
still others assail washington 's response to brazil in the face of grow ire over the espionage revelation report of which have be televise nationally for week
as resentment fester in brasã­lia the obama administration seem to put the tension with brazil on the back burner focus on other issue like syria
the inaction in the face of such an overreach have prove costly say michael shifter president of the inter american dialogue a washington policy group about the administration 's effort to offset the damage cause by the spying
washington would be wise to reflect on what this mean for its most crucial diplomatic effort in this hemisphere
michael d. shear contribute report from washington
if you follow my summer road trip from baton rouge la. to fargo n.d. you may have wonder how i get from new york to my start point in the first place
i drive 20 hour
alone
it be far cheap than fly into louisiana then have to rend a car pay a huge drop off fee in north dakota and fly home
i have hop for company to split both the driving and $ 175 or so in ga and toll
so about a week before my trip i post my route on three ride share site zimride.com erideshare.com and ridester.com
and get not a peep
with economic pressure push traveler to share resource whenever possible and various online service make that ever easier i wonder how this be possible
do i do something wrong
be the site inadequate
or be there simply not enough people out there look for such a ride
the answer turn out to be a bit of each
ride sharing 's move from campus bulletin board to internet have be less successful than expect
and though it ' still a potential moneysaver for traveler that ' mostly for distance easily cover in a day
so what could i have do better
my first mistake not post everywhere i should have
i do the right thing by list my ride at no charge on the site mention above
but i miss the big player in the game crusty old craigslist
sure it lack map or calendar or user profile or review or a way to pay in advance by credit card and not incidentally there ' little recourse if thing go wrong
but it have the ride more and more widespread at least base on my unscientific survey than the other site
luckily the second big number of listing seem to be on the most user friendly site zimride
the process for list and book ride be roughly similar to that for room on airbnb.com although zimride do not take a cut so you can choose between book online or contact the driver directly to make arrangement
other great feature its profile be facebook connect mean you can do a little online research into your potential travel partner and its algorithm often match people with different but potentially overlapping route
for example it may have find me someone who be go from baltimore to atlanta a nice chunk of my journey
in july zimride be buy by enterprise holdings know mostly for its car rental company
but accord to a spokeswoman laura bryant they have no plan to change anything
that seem like a smart move to me even more so now that i have speak to several zimride user i contact at random through the site
they be all enthusiastic user who have save money though the site do not stand on its own even for them they have all find it necessary to find rider on craigslist
they be a diverse bunch
fabio vargas 29 travel most weekend between his home in tallahassee and orlando fla. to visit his family and girlfriend and take along fellow rider when he can he charge $ 25 per passenger and calculate his annual saving at $ 1,300
paul orsett a 50-year old public school teacher from outside raleigh n.c. have use ride share to save on trip across the country
julia lipianskaya 23 a recent college graduate from palo alto calif. use to scramble to find friend to share the driving and ga cost to visit her family in the bay area until she find zimride in her senior year and start occasionally even turn a profit on her trip
all three take measure to reduce their risk vet potential rider online through facebook and google and have occasionally reject some
mr. orsett say passenger often vet him as well like me he ' in the prime potential creep age range
he point them to the web site of a local news station that feature him as teacher of the week
ms. lipianskaya originally take only woman passenger but gradually loosen her policy especially if she click over from zimride to the potential passenger 's facebook profile and find mutual friend
as a young woman travel alone it ' a little nerve racking sometimes she say
but i have not have any bad experience
i just always bring pepper spray
i hope i never have to use it
if you think this all sound like too much work and risk consider try a canadian and european service when go abroad
it turn out that the united states be way behind other country in long distance ride sharing
we 're do better with intracity ride sharing and taxilike service like lyft uber and sidecar
just across the border in canada kangaride.com appear to be boom
it have a slick interface and have about 5,000 ride post per week both zimride and craigslist decline to provide number include some between montreal and new york or boston
the trade off be that kangaride charge a yearly membership fee of 7.50 canadian dollar about the same in american dollar and charge passenger a 5 dollar fee per ride
but that money go toward a staff of 25 which check driver record under an agreement with several provincial government and monitor new member by follow up with their passenger after trip
the site function for trip within the united states as well but it be not yet widely use
as of now we 're focus our marketing effort on canada say robin grantner kangaride 's communication coordinator
but we would love to expand
let 's hope
traveler to europe may also consider look for ride online before they book expensive train ticket or plan to suffer the indignity of low cost airline
the german site carpooling.com have around 30 driver offer ride between berlin and munich each weekend average 30 euro about $ 38 at $ 1.28 to the euro a fraction of the train fare and also work across europe
in britain the big success story be liftshare.com which currently claim around 37,000 long distance ride list
people join up because they 're go to save half their travel cost or more say ali clabburn the site 's founder
but they come back again because they love the social side of it
mr. clabburn add that one in 100 briton have sign up and that despite 100,000 people share car every day they have never have a reported safety incident
as for my return trip from fargo
i persuade two old friend to fly out to meet me for the drive home which relieve me of the drive responsibility but not the ga cost
next road trip i will post smart and wide
or just go to canada
nobody be really expect to be the next oprah winfrey because that ' not go to happen not even for ms. winfrey
but this fall new aspirant be jostle for a perch on daytime television and they seek a talk show less to cap a career than to expand their marketing horizon
like a cookbook a perfume or a clothing label the daily talk show have become the late form of brand extension product placement of the persona
the queen latifah show make its debut on monday
bethenny frankel an alumna of the real housewife of new york city make her debut on sept 9
kris jenner mother of the kardashian brood end a trial run last month

now it ' add currency in the 24-hour a day business of be famous
the field be crowd
some of the most seasoned and popular television personality anderson cooper jeff probst and ricki lake recently try to host their own talk show and flop
katie couric 's show have hold on but the rating be weak than expect
at the moment ellen and dr. phil still lead the pack but new face include wendy williams and steve harvey be hold their own
like buy a lottery ticket produce a talk show do not cost much and somewhere sometime someone be go to win big
what ' strike about the newcomer be that their celebrity rest as much on commercial savvy as on conventional artistic talent
even queen latifah an accomplished movie actress and singer have her own one woman enterprise with a line of covergirl cosmetic and two perfume queen and queen of hearts
she be the star of an ad for zyrtec the allergy medication
she have also despite the apparent contradiction be a spokeswoman for both pizza hut and jenny craig
for her debut queen latifah choose to go old school
she ask one of ms. winfrey 's favorite guest john travolta to help kick off her talk show and bring in will smith an executive producer of her show on tuesday
like ms. winfrey she mingle celebrity and inspirational segment about deserving unknown she make over a classroom for a high school music teacher and his student and help war widow experience adventure travel
tuesday 's show be more animated than the premiere but still surprisingly sluggish
the more dynamic moment be glossy covergirl ad that star the host and punctuate the show
ms. frankel do not sing dance or act but she have parlay her popularity on reality show into an emporium of skinnygirl product from best sell diet and advice book to her own skinnygirl label of low calorie wine spirit and cocktail which be buy by beam the company better know for bourbon
alternately brash tearful empathetic zany bossy and boastful ms. frankel be a multipolar television personality
bethenny be a dizzying carnival of girl power news you can use and too much information include where and how much ms. frankel wax she make ellen look like the pbs newshour
and ms. frankel seem to view her late venture as a commitment she make time for not the pinnacle of her career
she say last week that she take a moment before each show to regroup because i really want to be here for you i want it to be kind of an hour that we just spend together and i be focused and i be not think about anything else 1 2 next page

instead he will undertake a structured rehabilitation program outline by andrews that will last about six to eight week
however if the forearm trouble return if he have numbness tingle or shoot pain harvey concede that something need to get do
surgery would be necessary and keep him out for about a year
harvey say he would rather bet on himself rehabilitate the elbow than have the surgery to be safe
he note how andrews have test the elbow and find nothing be move in place it should n't
harvey add he believe that it be very stable
when harvey 's injury be discover after he allow 13 hit in a loss to the detroit tigers in late august general manager sandy alderson indicate that harvey should have surgery and not attempt to pitch be hurt later and potentially miss time in 2015

he have nearly reach 180 inning when he be sideline
now if harvey go through the throwing program with no problem the mets will surely do their best to protect harvey and his elbow and treat it with utmost importance

but that program be end in december and she must select a new plan in the state marketplace
at the top of her mind be how much she will have to pay for tecfidera which cost more than $ 4,000 a month
i think that ' the hard thing right now be that it ' the unknown decide what the financial cost will be she say
the picture will not get immediately clear once enrollment begin

amc be have a hard time separate from its hit series
on tuesday the network announce that instead of a final season of mad men as be plan for next spring the much acclaimed series will divide in two push off the finale for another year
a day earlier the network announce it would spin off a new series from its hit zombie show
the walking dead and last week it make a deal to spin off a show from break bad
in the case of mad men amc be follow the strategy it take with break bad in divide up a plan final season into two installment and it will be wait a full year between seven episode arc
that mean the final season be really two entirely separate one at least in term of scheduling
the first seven show will be show next spring under the title the beginning
the second group will be show in 2015 and will be call the end of an era variety report that the write staff for the final season will include the oscar win screenwriter robert towne who will be designate a consulting producer
the show 's creator matthew weiner will shoot all the episode in one production cycle so in effect amc will simply be store away the last seven episode for a year

that would have leave amc with only the walking dead as a breakout hit
its other current drama hell on wheels and this year 's low winter sun have not remotely approach the level of success that break bad or mad man do
amc cancel the killing for a second time earlier this month

but in do so it will ask more patience from the show 's fan
the one benefit be the addition of one episode beyond what have be originally plan
in a statement mr. weiner say we plan to take advantage of this chance to have a more elaborate story tell in two part which can resonate a little bit longer in the mind of our audience

when consider backup power for mobile device consumer typically have two choice a portable battery that can charge multiple device or a charge case which be more convenient but usually work with only a single device
innovative technology a maker of gadget accessory think consumer should have both
the company 's justin power case which be design for the ipad have a build in battery that can charge the ipad and other gadget include io android and blackberry device at the same time
the company say the rechargeable battery in the justin case can charge an ipad twice or an iphone seven time on a single charge
that high capacity battery make the case ideal for traveler and others who use their device for long period
charge be a little slow however
it take me a few hour to fully charge my ipad a bit longer than the process take with a wall charger
four tiny led inside the cover let you know how much charge the case have leave
the synthetic leather exterior of the justin case be not particularly handsome but it ' durable and offer good protection and a nice grip
the ipad slide easily into the case through an interior opening near the hinge and a magnetic flap keep it securely in place
an integrated kickstand can be use to prop up the ipad in portrait mode
the trade off however be that the case be bulky double the thickness of the ipad even with the ultra slim model
and the case do not activate ipad 's automatic shut off when the cover be close
the justin case come with a micro usb cord and a wall adapter for charge but not a cord with a 30-pin connector to attach to the ipad which would have help immensely

thrust back into a central role in resolve the syrian conflict the five permanent member of the united nations security council meet on tuesday to negotiate a draft resolution that would hold syria to its pledge of identify all chemical weapon under government control for destruction but diplomat say major difference over a draft quickly emerge

the syrian government have say insurgent carry out the attack in which hundred of civilian be kill by exposure to sarin a chemical nerve agent
russia have support the syrian government 's assertion argue that it be illogical that syrian force could have be responsible
secretary general ban ki moon who call the report a chilling document that describe a war crime decline at a united nations news conference on tuesday to ascribe responsibility for that attack a position he have consistently hold
but mr. ban express hope that the russia united states agreement reach saturday negotiate by foreign minister sergey v. lavrov of russia and secretary of state john kerry have set in motion a diplomatic process that would overcome the division that have deadlocked the security council over syria since the conflict there begin 30 month ago
what be encourage be that the two foreign minister agree on a framework agreement how to deal with all these chemical weapon mr. ban say
i hope that spirit of very friendly negotiation on the basis of good rapport will help forge a unity among the security council

the russia united states agreement specify that if syria fail to comply with its obligation under the chemical weapon treaty the security council should impose measure under chapter 7 of the united nations charter which allow for coercive step include the use of military force
but differ interpretation of that passage have emerge among the permanent member of the security council over the past few day
diplomat say russia want chapter 7 mention as one of the option available to the council at a future date open the possibility that a further resolution would be need if syrian noncompliance become an issue
britain france and the united states on the other hand want the resolution language to convey the threat of chapter 7 action immediately in keep with their publicly state position that syria can not delay or dodge its obligation
france and the united states have also say they reserve the right to punish syria militarily a position criticize by russia as illegal under the united nations charter
the united states ambassador samantha power on tuesday invoke the detail provide in the chemical weapon report to press the argument that accountability and enforceability must be part of any security council resolution on syria grow out of the aug. 21 attack the deadly use of chemical weapon since saddam hussein 's force gas the kurdish village of halabja in 1988
for a crime of this magnitude it be not enough to say chemical weapon be use any more than it would have be enough to say that machete be use in rwanda in 1994 she say in remark to a general assembly session on the chemical weapon report
we must condemn the user and here we must acknowledge what the technical detail of the u.n. report make clear only the regime could have carry out this large scale chemical weapon attack the large attack in 25 year
the differing view be reflect earlier tuesday in a moscow meeting between mr. lavrov and france 's foreign minister laurent fabius
mr. lavrov be quote as say the agreement with the united states have make clear that if syria be noncompliant then the security council will examine the situation
mr. lavrov also dispute the conclusion draw by his western colleague from the chemical weapon report

at the same time abc 's reality war horse dance with the stars show some new life thanks to an intriguing lineup of celebrity dancer and cbs 's summer drama hit
under the dome finish its first season in strong fashion
but the big rating story monday be sleepy hollow a show that be announce without much fanfare last spring
the series garner many good review and strong word of mouth for its far out premise which involve the reincarnation of ichabod crane and the horseman some revolutionary war mythology and even biblical reference like the four horseman of the apocalypse
in its initial outing hollow pull 10.1 million viewer with an excellent 3.5 rating among the viewer fox sell to advertiser those between the age of 18 and 49
that be the best number of the night aside from monday night football on cable
it be a spectacular improvement for fox over the disastrous result it score last fall on monday night at 9 with a show call the mob doctor
some of the competition be weak than what hollow will ultimately face especially the voice on nbc and cbs 's comedy lineup which both start next monday
but abc do have the late edition of dancing feature some celebrity of high interest include the actress valerie harper defy her cancer prognosis and nicole polizzi snooki of jersey shore fame back down to her playing weight

what a cad i use to be constantly ditch the bistro that have open only four month ago for the week old trattoria with an even dewy complexion callously trade in the yellowtail sashimi that have be so good to me for a hot tamale of unproven charm
then a few year back the restaurant barbuto and i settle down
it ' bliss
she know my heart know my drill a gin martini to begin a seasonal salad for my appetizer the roasted chicken after
and i know her
if the weather 's nice a breeze will blow in from the west village street that her retractable wall open onto
the kale that she serve me will be sparingly dress
and the breast meat
as plump and tender as it be the last time around and the dozen time before that
we do not have firework not this late in the game
but we have a rhythm
sometimes that ' better
what i be say be that i be a regular there as i be at the breslin whose lamb burger be as true to me as i be to it at empellã³n taqueria where i never stray from the fish tempura taco which never let me down at szechuan gourmet where i do not glance at a menu
i do not have to
i be no monogamist that ' clear
more of a polygamist
but i dote on my sister wife
i have come to see that the broccolini be not always green on the other side of houston street and i be here to sing what ' too seldom sung the joy of familiarity
the pleasure of intimacy
the virtue of stay put
what you have with a restaurant that you visit once or twice be a transaction
what you have with a restaurant that you visit over and over be a relationship
the fashionable script for today 's food maven do not encourage that sort of bonding especially not in a city with new york 's ambition and inexhaustible variety
here you 're suppose to dash to the new andrew carmellini brasserie before anybody else get there be the first to taste abc cocina 's guacamole advertise an opinion about the massaman curry at uncle boons while others be still puzzle over the fugitive apostrophe
snap a photo
tweet it
then move on
there ' always something else
always virgin ground
for year i be dedicate to explore it by dint of my duty as the times 's restaurant critic
i be a pay philanderer
it be exhilarating
it be exhaust
and it be not necessarily the best course
i would think back to my pre critic day in rome and to the handful of restaurant i keep circle around to
the server and owner there would exult when i walk through the door because they understand how to make me happy and they could have a conversation with me different from the one they have with newcomer a conversation build on share history and reciprocal trust a dialogue between honest to goodness friend
i be not special
but i be special to them
i would think too of my food love father 's approach to din out
when he find a place with a few dish and a few server he adore and when those server reciprocate his affection he stop look around
call off the search
he understand what i have relearn these last few year with barbuto and the others the smile you get from host hostess and bartender who know you be entirely unlike the smile from one who be just meet you
they 're less theatrical less stilted warm by countless degree
regular matter to a restaurant
though the newcomer draw there by review or yelp chatter can keep it pack for a while the familiar face help it go the distance
that ' why some of those fusty pricey italian haunt on the upper east side outlast the trend conscious effort of this top chef alumnus or that darling of the culinary scribe
they have put extra energy into cultivate a steady clientele turn themselves into club into tribe
it ' the only way to do it say robert bohr one of the owner of the new restaurant charlie bird in soho which be design as be barbuto and so many other restaurant in that general area of downtown manhattan to be a repeat refuge for neighborhood folk who like to drop in impulsively
a few table be informally tag for such walk in as they 're call in the business and the menu accommodate snack as well as feasting
mr. bohr say that he have work at what he call destination restaurant and that while first- and second timer may keep them hum at peak hour during peak stretch it ' regular who support you on off day in bad weather during time of the night that be not prime time
in return regular at most restaurant get extra consideration a glass of sparkle wine that be not ask for a dessert that just appear a promotion to the head of the waiting list when the place be full
there ' a practical unemotional reason to join the frequent flier club
perk accrue
mr. bohr note that you can make request of a restaurant where you 're a regular that you would never make and that may not be indulge elsewhere
because he have lunch as often as once a week at abc kitchen he can place his order the second he sit down and say i want to be out in 25 minute
they 're welcome to that he say because he ' be loyal and he will be back 1 2 next page

i 'm tired of be funny say eva the los angeles massage therapist whose midlife travail be the subject of enough said a small miracle of a movie write and direct by nicole holofcener
it be possible to sympathize with eva and also to marvel at her curious sense of timing
happily or at least not miserably divorce with nice friend and a gratifyingly nondysfunctional teenage daughter eva play by the reliably hilarious julia louis dreyfus use her sense of humor as a social tool and an emotional defense
she ' a good sport a designate joker which be fine except that it mean that she never have to be take seriously even by herself
but as she roll over in the bed she have just share for the first time with albert james gandolfini also the divorce parent of a girl soon to leave for college eva sense another possibility
this guy whom she meet at a party and recently start date may actually get her not just her joke
he agreeably and gallantly say that he ' also tired of be funny
but you 're not funny she say as they snuggle against each other laugh at her own quick wit and also pay him a sincere if somewhat backhanded compliment
now be the time to state that enough said be very funny indeed
line for line scene for scene it be one of the best write american film comedy in recent memory and an implicit rebuke to the raunchy sloppy spectacle of immaturity that have dominate the genre in recent year
this be not to say that ms. holofcener an acute observer of the manner and moral of the self satisfied metropolitan middle class west coast division be decorous or genteel
she be rather almost ruthless in her attention to the petty vanity and hypocrisy of her character and the way their relatively privileged circumstance lead them to weave web of guilt complacency and stifle aggression
and yet it be also clear that ms. holofcener like them even or especially when they be ridiculous myopic or mean
this have be apparent in all of her feature so far from walk and talk 1996 through lovely and amazing 2002
friend with money 2006 and please give 2010
their only real flaw be scarcity
ideally ms. holofcener would be able to work at a woody allen pace issue annual bulletin from the life of people who after 15 or 20 minute already seem like your friend
in other word they be exasperating and difficult as well as lovable
ms. louis dreyfus be memorably describe in her seinfeld persona as a pretty woman with a face like a frying pan
that face have mature into a remarkably expressive instrument
eva be like no other movie character i have ever see and uncannily like a lot of real woman i know
motherhood on the big screen be typically view with pity sentimentality or resentment and romantic love tend to be treat in a similarly reductive manner as an impossible dream or a state of earthly bliss
ms. louis dreyfus and ms. holofcener know better and they approach eva 's emotional adventure as mother lover and friend as a series of practical and ethical challenge
her relationship with albert and with her daughter ellen the wonderfully sensitive tracey fairaway be each complicate by a third person whose presence at first seem benign or irrelevant
eva 's closeness to ellen 's needy best friend chloe tavi gevinson provoke some jealousy as ellen prepare to leave home
meanwhile she have acquire a new client and friend marianne catherine keener a poet with exquisite taste and an aura of high bohemian glamour who happen to be albert 's former wife
the real genius of enough said be that it take this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlock both its farcical potential and its latent profundity
what happen when the thing that you once find charming start drive you crazy
many love story address that question but ms. holofcener tilt it a few degree
do it matter that the thing about albert that eva find charming drive marianne crazy
should it
if you want to take the measure of ignacio mattos 's cooking at estela which open on east houston street in june you may look at the burrata on the menu and think no too easy
anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start
but order it anyway so you can see what happen when mr. mattos put this louche voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse
the burrata sit like whip cream on charred bread
soak into the bread and pool around it be a brooding green liquid press from lovage sorrel celery and other foliage
it look like something you would force yourself to drink after do very bad thing to your body ingest it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine the after midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser
that ' not what it feel like though
when this fatty sprawl of dairy be bring to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice it become something you taste not something that wash over you in a big creamy wave
it ' strange
but it ' right
strange food be often bear from a need to kill boredom ours or the cook 's
it can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad
mr. mattos 's cooking at estela have a mild case of weirdness
it be just unfamiliar enough that i have eat about a meal and a half there before it dawn on me that nearly everything be mediterranean more or less
i should have see that one come give that mr. mattos who grow up in uruguay cook at chez panisse for a year and il buco for five
the cooking be almost familiar but not quite and it ' the little difference that get under your skin
the flatbread serve with an excellent potato thicken mash of salt cod be a rye matzo
and a whole squid and a spring onion both griddle on a plancha and serve with a reasonably traditional romesco of red pepper and hazelnut look like a leathery podlike alien creature alongside a blacken stem that snake down the plate
the mild strangeness draw my attention to how deep and elemental the flavor of both dish be
mild strangeness have not always be mr. mattos 's preferred line of attack
when he be the chef at isa in williamsburg brooklyn he revel in deep surrealist weirdness
his best know dish there be fry sardine skeleton which look as if it belong behind glass at a museum of natural oddity
i remember rattle my jaw on nearly raw grain and get my first taste of sweet potato leaf which until then i have think be poisonous
estela which mr. mattos open with two partner mark connell and a wine guy slash general manager name thomas carter be far less confrontational in way that go beyond the kitchen
within two second of climb the step to this spare and intimate little dining room you know that there will be a speech on how the menu work that most of the dish will be small that sharing will be encourage that the noise level will climb steeply that the meal will cost more than the menu price lead you to believe
this be a particular danger if you be not careful with wine because mr. carter lead us into three digit temptation much more often than you would expect from a list that ' relatively compact
the dish be not compose of pixel size bit of food that have to be divide by laser surgery they generally share well
this be a good start but then estela like many small plate restaurant neglect the so call share plate that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serve platter
the share plate at estela be no big than tea saucer and be rarely swap out
one night assorted juice and sauce from eight recipe swirl together before a fresh plate come along
it be like see eight movie project on the same screen at once
new or big plate would help you to focus on the energetic crackle mr. mattos give beef tartare by fold fry sunchoke chip into the raw meat or the low growl of spice he lend to a fried egg and gigante bean by pair them with bread cube dunk in harissa
ingredient that do not appear to have be tamper with often have a depth of flavor that take you by surprise
there ' the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding
inside wheel of uncooked summer squash arrange like scale over intensely sweet raw scallop and pureed avocado
there ' the lemon that perk up white round of kohlrabi dress simply and wonderfully with shard of fossa cheese mint and crush toast hazelnut 1 2 next page

after month of contentious behind the scene battle the public may finally get its chance to own a piece of a new york city landmark the empire state building
the real estate family that control the 102-story art deco tower could move ahead as soon as this week with plan to sell share to the public through a real estate investment trust or reit.
it could be one of the large initial public offering ever of such a trust in a deal value at more than $ 5 billion
but even as malkin holdings race forward with the plan offering which include the iconic tower and 18 other office property it operate in new york city and in stamford conn. prospective buyer for the empire state building continue to come out of the woodwork
last week joseph sitt a new york city landlord increase his earlier bid
his company thor equities be now propose to buy empire state building associates which own the land the building and the lease for $ 1.4 billion in cash
that top mr. sitt 's offer from earlier this summer and be high than the $ 1.18 billion that the entity be value at as part of the reit. see as this new offer come in above both the appraise and exchange value in the propose reit that lead me to believe they be take it very seriously say jason meister an investment broker with avison young who represent thor equities
the offer by mr. sitt be the late in a string of unsolicited bid that have be rebuff by peter l. malkin and his son anthony e. malkin who contend that their plan which have already be approve by stakeholder be more valuable
furthermore most if not all of the bidder have have communication with richard edelman a stakeholder in the empire state building who have lead a group of dissident oppose to the plan reit.
that have lead to question about whether the offer for the building be real or just attempt to derail the initial public offering
one of the bid be make on a single sheet of paper and provide no information about where the buyer would find the money to finance the building 's purchase
additionally mr. meister who represent mr. sitt at thor be the son of stephen meister a lawyer represent some of the dissident shareholder
this should be a chill the champagne moment for the malkins
family member who be minority owner of the building have already win several crucial round in a long run battle with dissident stakeholder
with the public offering the malkins would be catapult into the upper echelon of manhattan real estate their stake could be value at an estimate $ 730 million and provide other legal and tax benefit
anthony malkin would become chairman of a new company empire state realty trust
in 1961 3,300 unit in the building be sell to stakeholder at $ 10,000 a unit with some individual buy multiple unit
after about a year of back and forth the malkins early this summer persuade the require 80 percent of the building 's roughly 3,000 stakeholder to vote in favor of go public
while the malkins still face a few remain hurdle in their fight with the dissident include a court ruling expect this fall on whether a judge 's ruling on new york 's limited liability corporation law be legal they be press ahead with their plan for a public offering
a spokesman for the malkins do not respond to an e mail seek comment
there be also question swirl around demand for a reit feature the empire state building as one of its cornerstone
while some investor will probably be draw to the romantic notion of own a piece of the fabled skyscraper some analyst note that the building and several of the other property include in the reit be not view as modern first class office building
in recent year the malkins have embark on a major renovation of the empire state building that be draw a better more corporate class of tenant and yield high rent
but the once hot market for real estate investment trust have cool considerably since this spring
a bloomberg index of office reits be down 10.5 percent since hit a four and a half year high in late may. reit do extremely well early in the year but share price have pull back since may say michael knott a manage director with real estate research firm green street advisors
he say however that new york office reit have hold up better than those in other part of the country in the belief that manhattan real estate have stabilize
while some of the bidder hope that the wobbly reit market have open the door for them to sweep in with a compete offer analyst say the bid so far appear to be fall short
the offer do not appear high enough to persuade the malkins to change direction mr. knott say

he be an investment broker with avison young who represent thor equities not a lawyer
washington the suspect in the killing of 12 people at the washington navy yard on monday test fire an ar-15 assault rifle at a virginia gun store last week but be stop from buy one because state law there limit the sale of such weapon to out of state buyer accord to two senior law enforcement official
instead the suspect aaron alexis of texas buy a law enforcement style shotgun an 870 remington pump action and use it on monday as he rampage through the navy yard say the official who request anonymity because the investigation be continue

when he discharge the piece of lead would spread the farther they go the one official say
it be similar to weapon use in bird shooting but on a more serious scale
these be not bullet but many small piece of lead fly through the air
after fire down on people the gunman begin to search for more people to shoot and as he search he be confront by a security guard near an exit accord to the official
the gunman shoot the guard and take his semiautomatic handgun then head back to the atrium
he run back upstairs and crank off more round with the handgun and then head to another stairwell where he confront a worker there and shoot him the official say
the gunman be believe to have shoot the navy employee who work in maintenance with the pistol near another exit
on saturday mr. alexis buy the remington shotgun and ammunition at the gun store and range in lorton va. sharpshooters small arms range where he also rent a rifle and practice with it accord to a lawyer for the store
the lawyer j. michael slocum say in an e mail that mr. alexis buy a remington 870 express 12-gauge shotgun and about two box of ammunition or about 24 shell
the purchase be approve after the store owner conduct the require federal background check mr. slocum say

the authorities say they do not believe the gunman use one
federal official say that there be some initial confusion at the scene about which firearm have be use and that it be hour before investigator be able to analyze video from the scene
it be unclear whether mr. alexis 's psychiatric issue ever progress to the point that he be involuntarily commit to a mental health institution or legally determine to be mentally ill or incompetent either of which would have bar him from buy a gun
if neither apply and most people who be treat for mental illness never get to that point then his situation would be similar to other gunman like jared l. loughner who kill 6 people and wound 13 include former representative gabrielle giffords in tucson in 2011 and james e. holmes who kill 12 people and wound dozen in a colorado movie theater last year
mental health expert point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness be never violent

in one mr. key play a terror suspect who ' the victim of a terrible misunderstanding his wiretapped conversation be about terrier
we write terrierist fiction
we spend a good deal of time discuss possible future terrierist plot
mr. key and mr. peele 's comedy be often call postracial but it may be more accurate to call it postsatirical at least compare with the work of someone like dave chappelle whose 2003 6 comedy central show have influence the format and theme of key peele
their best know and most directly political sketch the obama anger translator series be among their weak they be labor and not particularly insightful
what really set key peele apart be the star performance
mr. key especially be a gifted comic actor able to sell a range of character and attitude from ritualized black male anger to you lookin at me
italian mobster bravado
the gangster role come next week in a short slight sketch redeem by mr. key and mr. peele 's spot on portrayal of off duty goodfellas
as in das negros they insert themselves in conventional white role the flee jew the crooked italian and the white people around them do not notice
the joke be equally about race and pop culture stereotype but when the bullet start fly it ' just purely grossly funny
decade ago each fall dance season begin in central park
from 1962 to 1980 except for gap cause by finance in 1968 and 1973 an annual festival draw crowd to the delacorte theater
first it be call the rebekah harkness foundation dance festival and then from 1969 on the new york dance festival a name befit its place in the civic fabric
always it be free and eclectic its program mix establish and little know artist its audience mingle connoisseur and first timer
new yorkers love it and after the financing collapse and it be go
it be speak of as much miss
that festival be still defunct but since 2004 its place have be take by city center 's fall for dance
though the new festival be not quite free ticket originally $ 10 be now $ 15 it be eclectic both in the dance company that have participate 177 of them and in those who have watch 220,000 ticket sell
fall for dance 's 10th installment do not begin at city center until next wednesday but as a celebratory prelude and a claim to a legacy the festival bring dance back to the delacorte for free show host by the public theater on monday and tuesday
new york dance festival lore be fill with story of dancer slip and slide in the rain adventure in outdoor theater
but the weather on monday night be clear and chill with a nearly full harvest moon put on a show of its own alone above the stage or frame by tattered cloud
the proscenium arch of the firmament and a backdrop of tree make the delacorte a site for dance like no other in the city
at first the tree be occlude by scaffolding a multilevel structure some 30 foot high hang with work light to resemble a makeup mirror
this be the set for human fountain by streb extreme action company
the 20 performer sleek in red unitard march on like astronaut before a launch and launch be what they do repeatedly climb the scaffolding and diving off it to crash flat onto a thick mat below
there ' a vicarious thrill in the drop and some variation in the form tilted dive backward dive corkscrew jackknife
there ' grace in a domino line of diver each open an arm to rotate into reverse fall
but the shape in the air be halfhearted and the choreography quickly grow dull
the piece keep land with a thud bear little relation to its mozart accompaniment
it be supposedly inspire by the bellagio fountain in las vegas but those waterworks be much more musical
at this festival it feel like an overextended pun
still human foundation be suit to the outdoors
ronald k. brown 's upside down a much better deep work lose some of its power in the open space
instead of scaffold the dance be back by roll stage fog light green or red and by musician two drummer a d.j. and the statuesque singer wunmi olaiya work up a fela kuti groove
the rich suppleness of mr. brown 's west african base movement register as do the profundity in the work 's confrontation of life force and mortality yet its group patterning seem stretch thin
the dance burn but also gutter like a flame in the wind
red angels by ulysses dove do not belong anywhere
certainly not in the repertory of new york city ballet which send four of its dancer to represent the company in this inane double duet
that it ' set to a solo for electric violin play live by mary rowell be its practical justification
yet as an attempt at trashy it be not even flashy and from the troupe with the world 's great stock of ballet it ' a terrible waste
what new dancegoer could fall for it
blessedly the evening finish with the paul taylor dance company in esplanade
as its title tell you this classic dance from 1975 be at home in the open air
on a program with the climbing and fall of human fountain it make similar point about simple verb
mr. taylor 's dancer walk run jump and crawl
but they do these basic activity to bach and the relationship between their action and the music be meaningful
the meaning keep change a hand extend in yearn then in rejection run be playful then distraught
the work be less dangerous than human fountain but more daring
in the end joy in motion triumph with the dancer dive across the stage
this be how to make audience fall for dance fall hard and fall for good
the fall for dance festival run from next wednesday through oct. 5 at city center 131 west 55th street manhattan 212 581 1212 nycitycenter.org
the saxophone be the most ambiguous of instrument
though ubiquitous in jazz and pop it have long remain on the fringe of classical music bring in for the occasional bolero but rarely afford the spotlight
when it find its way into the orchestra it often function as a jazzy outsider an ambassador of pop
few contemporary composer be better poise to trade on the saxophone 's ambivalent status than john adams who long ago master the art of move nimbly between the classical and pop world
mr. adams have toy with the instrument ever since he introduce a saxophone quartet into his opera nixon in china a quarter century ago
and in recent year mr. adams have rediscover the saxophone and its midcentury jazz legacy even as he have distance himself from young composer who draw on the commercial music of their own era
when the soloist timothy mcallister and the baltimore symphony orchestra give the united states premiere of mr. adams 's saxophone concerto on friday at meyerhoff symphony hall in baltimore it will be an auspicious event for the large but often overlook world of classical saxophonist
those who miss the baltimore performance can hear the concerto perform by mr. mcallister and the st. louis symphony orchestra in a live online broadcast on oct. 5 nonesuch will release a recording next spring
this new work grow out of mr. adams 's lifelong love for the slippery sound of the sax and also take inspiration from the virtuoso technique of mr. mcallister who be a professor at the bienen school of music at northwestern and at 40 one of the foremost saxophonist of his generation
in 2009 mr. adams hear mr. mcallister play city noir mr. adams 's jazz inflect symphonic work with a major saxophone part and decide he have to write more for him
in a recent phone interview mr. adams eagerly extol mr. mcallister 's strength
you find that with great artist that the detail the actual technical detail of the instrument the reed the mouthpiece the pad and all of those little tiny minuscule physical detail be so important mr. adams say
on the one hand that impress me and the other be just his absolute indefatigable willingness to just do anything
mr. mcallister seize the opportunity
for me personally adams have be no
1
he ' be for me the no 1 goal of someone we need to get a piece from he say recently
it ' still adams at the core deep polyrhythmic structure these huge giant kind of glacial form
that ' really exciting to hear these trademark about his music and then reference the saxophone in these multiple setting
the saxophone have autobiographical implication for mr. adams who say that it have always be a part of my musical genealogy
his father play alto in swing band in the 1930 and mr. adams dabble with the sax in his youth
his main instrument be clarinet
though the saxophone have its own classical repertory mr. adams seek out model from jazz
stan getz 's 1961 album focus and the compilation charlie parker with strings be particular inspiration
the sound of the saxophone with the orchestra particularly with the string orchestra be just magical mr. adams say
it always puzzle me that there be so few saxophone concerto and certainly no really great saxophone concerto in the way that there ' the mozart clarinet concerto there be in fact more than a few saxophone concerto just none that be regularly perform by symphony orchestra
the best know be by relatively obscure composer like glazunov and ibert
invent by adolphe sax in 1846 for military band the saxophone have a few early classical advocate like berlioz
but snobbery and intonation issue mostly keep the instrument out of the orchestra
instead saxophone find their way into american dance band in the 1910 and become core member of swing band as well as the instrument of choice for jazz soloist 1 2 next page
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 19 2013because of an editing error an article on wednesday about the new saxophone concerto by the composer john adams misstate the length of the work
it be a half hour long not an hour

maybe we never outgrow the imaginary animal kingdom of childhood
maybe it ' the one we be try to save
these be jon mooallem 's intriguing word write in the introduction to his book wild ones
its subtitle be a sometimes dismaying weirdly reassuring story
about look at people look at animals in america but i think of it on sunday afternoon at la mama while watch sacred elephant a south african production base on the poem by the englishman heathcote williams americans have not corner the market on mr. mooallem 's sentiment
direct by geoffrey hyland and perform by jeremy crutchley sacred elephant offer a torrent of word in praise of the creature 's nature and in despair over its fate
yet even as mr. williams 's word indict human for their treatment of these animal they draw comparison between the two specie
and from a share aquatic past the elephant inherit the one quality that homo sapiens have always arrogantly assume distinguishes him from the brute beast an elephant in distress
will weep salt tear
as mr. crutchley speak he move between man and beast and something more indeterminate his character be call the other and he be a compelling figure in his long coat and ankle shackle
his face be etch with sweaty rivulet of gray makeup his hair mat into a dreadlocked ponytail his eye redly rim
costume design be by illka louw
at time during the play a roughly hourlong monologue mr. crutchley rid a wild sharply edge energy that seem only partly moor to the word at hand
these word be by turn funny caustic and when least effective self consciously poetic
this would not seem the time for gild the lily with ode to the noble elephant it be difficult to be unmoved when consider the rapidity with which elephant be be exterminate
at the same time if activism be the aim here it seem rather a misguided use of resource it be also difficult to imagine a typical la mama audience contain people who be pleased at the idea of elephant extinction
and as a dramatic endeavor
sacred elephant could do with a bit more texture
mr. crutchley work overtime to supply it
but then again lamentation be not necessarily vehicle for variety and there be not much here to reassure weirdly or otherwise

and the united states will not do any of this by trust
this be not a matter of trust
it ' a matter of verify and verify and enforce
i think everybody in the united states need to understand please this would not have happen we would not have get this agreement if there have not be a legitimate threat of force that be pass by the foreign relations committee and that the congress be consider

elvis costello and the root begin their encore at brooklyn bowl late monday night with a wry lamentation as churn and ominous as a gathering storm on the plain
the song be wise up ghost which provide both a title and a centerpiece for their trenchant new album on blue note
its delivery be impassioned unruly a bit grandiose -â grip but in a crucially different way from the rest of the show
because otherwise mr. costello the eminent post punk eclectic and the root hip hop 's protean house band give an extended lesson in collaborative thrift beef up some of his old song and cleanly tackle most of their new one
both party have make a recent sport out of play well with others and here they chase a lean intensity leave few scrap on the bone
the show be sell out and its high celebrity quotient underscore the sense of a rare occasion which be more than the song be prepared to do
wise up ghost the album be a taut sandpapery production full of caustic pronouncement deliver with medium cool affect
mr. costello sing evenly if obliquely about various form of ruination and betrayal against an assortment of vintage distressed funk and soul groove
at the foreground of every track be a drum part execute with slippery precision by ahmir thompson a k a questlove the brain behind the root and a musical savant whose obsessiveness rival mr. costello 's
perhaps take a cue from certain marvin gaye record the result of this synthesis can feel festive even in the grip of despair as on walk us uptown the album 's lead single
will you walk us uptown while our tear run in torrent to suffer in silence or pray for some solace wake me up which open the show at a prowl gait be just as point there must be something better than this mr. costello grouse in the chorus reuse a line from his recent partnership with the new orleans soul magistrate allen toussaint
my thought return to vengeance but i put up no resistance go another rueful line
there ' a lot of strategic repurposing throughout wise up ghost and there be even more in the show
some of this be as straightforward as an old tune give a fresh makeover the root work with a strong horn section bring a sinister funk vibe to shabby doll and turn up the heat on spooky girlfriend which also feature a spirited vocal turn by la marisoul of the los angeles band la santa cecilia
and in the accumulative deep swirl crescendo on i want you there be a know echo of i want you
she ' so heavy by john lennon
it ' not hard to picture questlove and mr. costello arrive together at that idea in any case another lennon tune
i find out serve as a rawboned final encore plunge toward afro punk
other bit of repurposing be sneakier
tripwire a waltz that feature guest vocal harmony by diane birch bear more than a casual resemblance to satellite
and on stick out your tongue mr. costello interpolate whole lyric swatch from not one but two tune from the vault hurry down doomsday
the bugs be take over and pill and soap one line rip well out of context now suggest a hint of self appraisal in time you can turn these obsession into career
mr. costello be in excellent plangent voice throughout the show which be archive online by wfuv.org
and he be in textbook form chewing gum stand at a slouch exude his indifferent charisma
even by the high standard of his collaborative history he be notably invigorate by his company
the root meanwhile now occupy a fascinating and maybe unprecedented position
since prove wickedly adept with a variety format -â questlove and company will soon follow jimmy fallon from late night to the tonight show the group have have a diminishing role for black thought tariq trotter its incisive workhorse of a rapper and frontman
he gamely do his part on late night and he put in a token appearance on wake up
g.o.o.d/columbia/homeschool the band 's 2010 album with john legend
that he ' nowhere to be find on wise up ghost a product of analogous style and political conscience feel like a slight and maybe a further sign of shift ground
but if there ' anything the root have prove in recent year it ' the danger of jump to conclusion about their intent
count that among the way mr. costello fit right in
follow be the text of remark to reporter by secretary of state john kerry before a closed senate briefing on tuesday as transcribe by federal news service mr. kerry hey folk

the sound a d major chord produce by an orchestra and a chorus begin abruptly full force and fill the air for 20 minute like a sonorous foghorn with a stuck switch
it end as suddenly as it begin but there be no applause because the orchestra be only half finish its member sit without play or even move perform silence for just as long
this highly eccentric symphony receive its first new york performance on wednesday be create by the artist yves klein who be best know for his monochrome painting
he harbor no small ambition when he begin think in the late 1940 about a kind of musical complement to his visual idea a symphony of monotony and silence a much hard thing to do well than he or anyone imagine
you can not really do a full rehearsal of something like this say roland dahinden a swiss composer and performer who have conduct the piece four time in europe and will take the baton and stopwatch in new york
it ' too hard
everyone would just die
klein be one of the lead heir of marcel duchamp 's modernist wit but he be not joke around
the monotone silence symphony he write express no less than what i wish my life to be
but klein who die of a heart attack at the age of 34 in 1962 never have the chance to hear his symphony realize as he imagine it
for the only document performance during his lifetime in 1960 at an art gallery in paris with klein himself in white tie as conductor only 10 musician participate
on wednesday evening the fulsome orchestra he dream of 70 musician and singer will gather to perform the work at madison avenue presbyterian church at east 73rd street
the hope among those involve be that the sell out performance the product of month of intense planning will hew close to klein 's ethereal intention than many other version attempt since his death
with that goal in mind the performer and mr. dahinden have be prepare themselves mentally over the last few week for an unusual test of stamen patience and repose to play one note in an intense and continuous way as klein instruct for an unreasonable amount of time and then to remain quiet and motionless for longer than most people ever do
mr. dahinden who be be fly in for the one night event by the dominique levy gallery which be produce it add when it ' right you have this huge block of sound
there be such a beauty within the piece
you sit in the audience and you start to hear some melody and some fragment of melody and yet nobody be play them
klein say he saw the work as have neither a beginning nor an end a creation free from the phenomenology of time to pull off the first half of the symphony the singer and musician 10 cellist 10 violinist 3 bassist 3 flutist 3 oboist and 3 french horn player need to produce the chord with no vibrato or variation breathing and bow in such a way as to create a sound with no audible break
early on klein compare the sound to a human scream and play recording of scream one quite harrowing example be the voice of the french playwright antonin artaud to demonstrate
sahra motalebi a new york singer and performance artist who have help to assemble the musician and the choir which will be make up of both professional singer and experimental musician say the reality be that it ' like a kind of bizarre primordial universe chorus
it ' not like a note you have ever hear
klein conceive of the idea for the symphony around 1947 48 the same year that john cage in new york be formulate 4'33 a landmark work that involve a pianist not play the piano but instead attune an audience to the complexity of silence
though there seem to be no evidence that cage and klein be aware of each other at the time or influence each other later klein also come to view silence as the most important part of the musical work
this be really my symphony he write and not the sound during its performance

daniel moquay who oversee the klein archive and estate in paris say the silence be sometimes more difficult than the sound for audience to take in
you get into the deepness of a silence and you realize that silence be not a nothing he say
silence be something that be very very powerful
the work anticipate some of the interest that fluxus artist would soon begin explore in new york and europe in the 1960 and it feel very much in tune with work by young contemporary artist like ragnar kjartansson who in 2011 stag a critically acclaim 12-hour performance of the denouement of mozart 's the marriage of figaro by opera singer
klein 's symphony have be perform both with the permission of the estate and without over the last four decade once by a chorus of as many as a hundred singer and at least once by a single musician with a laptop
during the original 1960 performance klein include a companion piece in which three naked woman he call them live brush cover themselves in his signature deep blue paint and press their body on paper during the sound half of the symphony freeze during the silence that part will not be recreate in new york
dominique levy who be open her new gallery at 909 madison avenue next door to the church become determined to produce the symphony to accompany her inaugural exhibition audible presence lucio fontana yves klein cy twombly an examination of idea about time and music in work by those three artist
ticket for the free performance be all claim almost immediately after it be announce
ms. levy first hear the symphony in 2007 and say that after the abrupt cut between the sound and the silence i have all these conflicting feeling of want to laugh and then confusion and then finally deep emotion
early this year she secure permission from the klein archive to produce the work and dispatch jennifer g. buonocore the gallery 's associate director to paris to delve into the archive to try to ensure that the work would be realize with the best understanding of what klein want
but even with the best effort and intention mr. moquay say the symphony do not always work
of four performance hold in a paris church during a klein exhibition at the pompidou center in 2007 he say he feel that only one be wholly successful
but it work so well he add that a lovely kind of st. francis moment occur
the door of the church be open and a pigeon come in and sit where everyone could see him he say
during the 20-minute silence he do not move at all
it be kind of incredible
and then when the silence be over he leave
as the director of the rockettes linda haberman know it be time to leave santa behind
as she put it christmas be kind of a safe place to live
comfort zone have never interested ms. haberman
begin on march 27 she will unveil heart lights the rockettes first spring production at radio city music hall since 1997
play for 59 performance it will have nothing to do with the music hall 's previous easter spectacle
in the new show ms. haberman bring new york city to life while continue to modernize the precision dance company with more athletic technically demand choreography
this be not a book musical and it ' not a revue she say
it ' like its own animal
and this animal at present have no traditional kick line
you 're go to see a lot of stuff you have never see the rockettes do before ms. haberman say
i 'm definitely expand their vocabulary
in this show i feel like there be no limit
on wednesday a section from electricity a number inspire by times square will be unveil on nbc 's america 's got talent
the dance be a showcase for ms. haberman 's radical new version of a kick line it feature a developpe in which the leg slowly unfold and be hold for a count and include only four kick
i 've be experiment with way to create the same feeling without do the literal kick line she say
produce by the madison square garden company heart lights feature a story by doug wright the pulitzer prize and tony award winner for i be my own wife

the tale follow two teenage girl through new york as they unearth clue about their grandmother 's past
during the journey the rockettes perform dance that draw on the essence of new york landmark like the metropolitan museum of art a modern dance with an egyptian flair central park a moody tap number set to the eurythmics
here come the rain again and the stock exchange a fast athletic dance that incorporate knee turn and hip hop
for us it ' about make sure that we maintain the precision part of it ms. haberman say
as long as we have a specific point of view about what we 're do i do not think we 're break our tradition
still this be a new era for the rockettes found in 1925 by russell markert as the missouri rockets
his remarkable parade of the wooden soldiers choreograph in 1933 remain a highlight of the christmas spectacular

in heart lights ms. haberman create her own response to it
the simplicity of that have always just kill me because it ' so brilliant she say
i 'm like what can i do
when visitor come to new york they 're like
oh my god you walk so much
i can not believe how much you walk
so it start out with one rockette walking and then another and then pattern happen and it build and build until it get crazy
it look like two solid line be bisect each other
unlike the radio city christmas spectacular which feature two cast and open on nov. 8 heart lights have only one cast
recently the unthinkable happen an audition for the show be hold among the rockettes
the dancer traci reszetylo who have work on the production since its beginning do not know if she ' in or out
i just try to keep myself calm she say
it mean so much to me just to even have be a part of it for this long
but as much as the rockettes be at the core of heart lights ms. haberman be also hop to create a deep emotional connection with the show
it ' great to see dance that move you and all of that but i think that with the city and the rockettes there ' just a story that ' universal to all of us she say
it ' about where you come from and where you want to go
it ' about why people come to new york to chase their dream
i be one of those people
the busy violinist johnny gandelsman be suppose to have make his new york recital debut on aug. 13 at le poisson rouge
but fate intervene announce the concert 's cancellation on twitter he compress into a hashtag the saying if you want to make god laugh tell him your plan
in remark from the stage at the reschedule recital on monday mr. gandelsman say without elaboration that it have not be bad news that force him to cancel
the only apparent down side for him be that le poisson rouge its fall season already crowd could only fit him into a slot at 10:30 p.m.
that may not have be a down side at all
even over 90 intermissionless minute of dense solo violin music there be few yawn from the attentive and enthusiastic audience and just as in lincoln center 's series a little night music the late hour add more coziness to what be already an intimate program and space
a fixture on the new york music scene mr. gandelsman play in the string quartet brooklyn rider and the chamber orchestra the knights and have long be a member of the stylistically omnivorous silk road ensemble
in 2008 he found a label
in a circle records
juxtaposition of old and new energize all these group
brooklyn rider have perform and record seven steps a partly improvised group composition alongside the work that inspire it beethoven 's opus 131 string quartet
so it be no surprise that mr. gandelsman 's recital range from the baroque to philip glass
but the program be plan and perform to emphasize coherence rather than diversity a treatment that be particularly revelatory when it come to the choice of mr. glass 's strung out 1967
while many have remark on indian music and rock 's influence on his early work mr. glass 's early music connection have be less note
but play between â heinrich ignaz franz von biber 's grand passacaglia and bach 's sonata no 3 strung out sound quintessentially baroque with the same tension between stillness and motion the same working and reworkings of small piece of musical material
mr. gandelsman his ornamentation immaculate and nimble like spark in a dark church be as attentive to the music 's broad narrative as to tiny shift of texture and mood his tone translucently smooth at one point and with a dusky burr at another
wear jean a vest and short sleeve mr. gandelsman look folksy and his playing be accordingly unpretentious mod and clear with irresistible lightness a bright trill and a preternatural perhaps premature wistfulness
his vibrato be restrain in stravinsky 's somber ãlegie write in 1944 for viola and there be a core of melancholy calm even in the jovial moment of his rendition of bach 's partita no 2 which end almost exactly at midnight
the patriarch tikhon choir a mix voice professional ensemble of 35 american canadian and russian singer be form recently to focus on orthodox christian sacred music a tradition it hop to nurture in the united states

the 25-member panel be establish in july by gov. andrew m. cuomo to address what have be widely decry as a corruption crisis in albany and other political sphere in new york state
mr. bharara say that as part of the initiative prosecutor in his office file court paper on monday in two separate corruption case give notice that they be add the pension of two state senator a city councilman and two other official to the list of property subject to forfeiture if the official be convict
any forfeiture action against a convict official 's pension would require judicial approval
mr. bharara call it a galling injustice that corrupt official can draw a publicly fund pension until their die day
he say that the statute under which official for decade have be able to collect their pension despite corruption conviction be an error of state law and he note that while it have be partially fix several year ago it must succumb to common sense
convict politician should not grow old comfortably cushion by a pension pay for by the very people they betray in office he say

the official whose pension could become subject to forfeiture as a result of the new filing be state senator malcolm a. smith state senator eric stevenson city councilman daniel j. halloran and noramie jasmin and joseph desmaret the mayor and deputy mayor of the rockland county town of spring valley

mr. smith 's lawyer gerald l. shargel say the action by prosecutor be premature
they can not have forfeiture without a conviction and what i be focus on be defend the allegation in the indictment and i be eager to do that he say
vinoo p. varghese a lawyer for councilman halloran contend that it be inappropriate for mr. bharara to speak about his client before the public commission because he say the councilman have not commit a crime
lawyer for mr. stevenson and ms. jasmin decline to comment and mr. desmaret 's lawyer do not respond to e mail and voice mail message
mr. bharara say that under his office 's new policy prosecutor would also seek what he call appropriate fine with an eye toward the money that convict corrupt official may receive from publicly finance pension so the punishment fit the crime and so we can take the profit out of that crime
he also say that his office would consider civil forfeiture action against the pension of corrupt official who be previously convict and who fail to pay fine forfeiture or restitution impose at sentencing in order to satisfy those criminal judgment
and in future case as well as pending one like those in which action be take on monday prosecutor will use federal forfeiture law to strip politician convict of corruption charge
the panel convene at pace university also hear testimony from loretta e. lynch the united states attorney in brooklyn and cyrus r. vance jr. the manhattan district attorney
ms. lynch outline some of the current allegation face legislator include filing false travel voucher and more serious crime like obstruction of justice while mr. vance call for toughen state corruption law which he say be weak that those that prohibit thing like fix a fight
those that bribe public official in new york be less likely to be prosecute than those that bribe boxer mr. vance say
outside protester gather to rally for strong corruption law chant follow the money amid a heavy police and security presence

you may think that if you run a business where 35 of your employee in a five year period be indict convict or investigate and lead out in handcuff that this may inspire a period of reflection mr. fitzgerald say
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 20 2013an article on wednesday about a new york prosecutor 's plan to curtail the pension of official convict of corruption misidentified in some edition the county in which spring valley n.y. be locate

northwestern be 3 0 heading into saturday 's game against maine with an offense average more than 43 point a game and a roster that be get the right amount of sleep
since pat fitzgerald become the coach in 2006 he have place an unusual emphasis on his player sleep behavior as a way to improve their performance
in the past he have change the time of practice and institute team nap but since the beginning of august in collaboration with the university 's school of engineering fitzgerald have have his team undergo a sleep assessment
the idea be to assess the player sleep pattern and then suggest way they can have more and sound sleep
the player begin wear movement sensor armband during training camp except when they be practice or in the weight room
the sensor have mainly be use to track the quantity and quality of sleep each player get
fitzgerald plan to have his player wear them throughout the rest of the season
although player be not require to wear the sensor most do
at first we do not really know much about sleep and we be just curious say defensive end tyler scott a team captain
but we really embrace it and after a while we get really competitive about sleep efficiency
we start check our data every day
the study have already have an effect
before northwestern 's season opener at california on aug. 31 fitzgerald shift the team 's practice start time nap time and meal time to a west coast schedule in an attempt to minimize the effect of jet lag
the kickoff be schedule for 7:30 p.m. in california which be 9:30 in evanston ill.
so the wildcats begin practice at 9:30 p.m. make bed time for most player sometime from 1 to 2 a.m. fitzgerald do not hold any football activity in the early morning allow the player to sleep until 10 a.m. emma adam a northwestern professor and an expert on sleep in adolescent and young adult say she have see individual log and study their own sleep pattern but she have never see an assessment do on this big a group of athlete
what they 're do be take exist sleep research and translate it into a program design for their athlete that they hope will improve not only athletic performance but also a whole bunch of other thing adam say
sleep have effect on cognition your attention your memory your mood your metabolism your appetite it affect so many different thing
this be not the first time that fitzgerald and his coach staff have experiment with sleep schedule
midway through last season fitzgerald notice that his player appear sluggish during an afternoon game
after confer with a few player he learn that many have be take afternoon nap during the week because of their class schedule
fitzgerald then implement a mandatory nap time on game day
it be a source of joke at first but the player tell fitzgerald that the extra rest be beneficial
the result also be positive the team finish 10 3 only the third time northwestern have win at least 10 game
in 2007 fitzgerald 's second year he experiment with move practice time from the afternoon to early in the morning
we be one of the first and certainly probably one of the most high profile to make that full commitment to morning practice say tory lindley an associate athletic director and the director of athletic training service

since then i have hear from a number of head athletic trainer around the country who have call us about our schedule and who have since move and change their schedule
the result lindley say be that the player be receive better nutrition before and after practice and that their performance be steady and more predictable
fitzgerald 's emphasis on sleep may still draw raise eyebrow from some
but he have more victory than any other football coach in northwestern 's history and the wildcats figure to be a force in the big ten this season
that may be enough to prompt other team to consider the possibility of monitor their player sleep pattern
through all the thing that you have to do as a coach to try to help your guy perform at a high level and peak at the right time we 're always try to find way to improve what we 're do and what we 're teach he say and this be kind of the new frontier

we can draw three lesson from the arrival of apple 's two new iphone model the 5c and 5s. lesson
1 apple may have set its own bar for innovation too high
year after year steve jobs use to blow our mind with product we do not know we want
now two year after his death we still expect every new iphone to clean our gutter cook our popcorn and levitate
so when the hardware revision be minor each year we 're disappointed
and sure enough after apple show off its two new iphone model last week its stock drop
analyst shrug that they contain nothing transformative
the blogger hater have a field day
the budget model the new iphone 5c come in five color $ 100 for the 16-gigabyte model with a two year contract $ 550 without
it ' essentially identical to last year 's iphone 5 except that its back and side be a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass
actually plastic be not quite fair
the 5c 's case be polycarbonate lacquer like a glossy piano
better yet its back edge be curve for the first time since the iphones of 2008
you can tell by touch which way it ' face in your pocket
it ' a terrific phone
the price be right
it will sell like hot cake the new iphones go on sale friday
but just sheathe last year 's phone in shiny plastic be not a stunning advance
lesson 2
the smartphone be mature
the app store fill a huge hole
siri voice command answer a desperate need
and high resolution retina display help compensate for the tiny screen
but today every phone have that stuff the big hole have be plug
maybe the age of annual mega leap be over
the new 5 $ 200 with contract $ 650 without look exactly like last year 's thin and gorgeous iphone 5
you can now get it with its brushed aluminum body in dark gray with black glass accent silver white accent or a surprisingly classy look gold white accent
apple say the 5 's chip be twice as fast as before
nobody be exactly complain about the iphone 's speed before but sure it ' plenty quick
since it ' a 64-bit chip apple say the graphic in 3-d video game look especially smooth and detailed
there ' also a second chip devote to track motion data from the phone 's compass gyroscope and tilt sensor
apple say this coprocessor should save battery life when you use fitness track apps because it can monitor your data all day long the main chip which require six time as much power can remain asleep
those be both fairly invisible change though
the new camera will mean more to you
its sensor be 15 percent big and the individual light detect pixel be big
take photo side by side with the iphone 5s 's predecessor and the difference be immediately obvious lowlight picture be far better on the new phone
clearer bright better color
the 5 also have two led flash one pure white one amber that fire simultaneously
when mix in the right balance their light can match the color tone of your subject moonlight streetlight fluorescent whatever
apple say this idea be a first in both phone and camera
it really work
flash photo look much much better
no longer will your loved one skin look either nuclear white or avatar blue
the 5s 's camera also offer a burst mode 10 frame a second 3x zooming during video capture instagram style photo filter and truly wow slow motion video
weirdly filter photo and slo mo video do not survive the transfer to your computer although you can send them by e mail or text message
sample photo and video accompany this column online
the most heavily promote feature be the 5s 's fingerprint sensor which ingeniously be build into the home button
you push the home button to wake the phone leave your finger there another half second and boom you have unlock a phone that nobody else can unlock without the hassle of inputting the password
and yes a password be a hassle half of smartphone user never bother set one up

during this year 's world baseball classic cuba 's jose dariel abreu hit a grand slam against china that be positively jaw dropping
abreu a powerfully build right handed hitter load up on his back leg wait on a curveball and hit a tower drive halfway up the outfield stand
thirty major league front office be surely pay attention
last month abreu defect from cuba the late player to leave the nation to pursue a major league career
yasiel puig 's electric summer in los angeles for the dodgers and yoenis cespedes 's success with the oakland athletics the past two season have help to fuel the hype surround abreu 's imminent arrival in the major
it be possible that when abreu do sign his deal will be the rich of any cuban defector top puig 's $ 42 million
there be more and more interest in the cuban player all the time say the agent jaime torres who represent puig
look how well they be do
still abreu be a player who have spend his career hide from most major league scout and have essentially be compete against hard to evaluate opponent
he could be the next great cuban star or merely the beneficiary of a bull market for cuban player
there be little certainty either way
abreu 26 stand 6 foot 3 inch and weigh 250 pound
he be a first baseman with ample power but also a sharp batting eye and the ability to hit for a high average
the number he put up in cuba 's serie nacional be staggering
in the 2009 10 season abreu rise to stardom when he hit .399 with 30 home run 76 run bat in and a .555 on base percentage
the next year he have one of the best season in the history of the cuban league bat .453 with 33 home run and 93 r.b.i. in only 66 game he miss 23 with bursitis in his shoulder
his past two season have be similarly prodigious
at the world baseball classic this year he be 9 for 25 with 3 home run in 6 game
abreu be often call a four tool player miss only the speed of his countryman puig and cespedes
scout have compare him to ryan howard because of his size and easy power
peter bjarkman who cover the cuban league for baseballdecuba.com say abreu have the look of a young mark mcgwire
add to his value abreu will be part of a relatively thin free agent class in the major league
so far the san francisco giants have express interest as have the boston red sox the pittsburgh pirates and the baltimore orioles
the mets still look for an impact hitter at first base would also make an intriguing landing spot
ike davis once think to be the mets first baseman of the future spend time at class aaa las vegas this season and be recently shelve with an oblique injury
neither of his replacement lucas duda and josh satin inspire much confidence as a long term solution
abreu could be a quick albeit expensive fix should general manager sandy alderson decide he be up for a somewhat risky bid war
but abreu be hardly a guarantee at the major league level
an international scout for one major league team say that alfredo despaigne and frederich cepeda outfielder on the cuban national team be more dangerous hitter
an international scout for another team say that major league club could not afford to make a mistake when spend big on a first baseman since it be a traditional power position fill by player who bat in the middle of the lineup
in other word the scout say the same money that could be use to sign abreu may be better spend in the acquisition of one of the many establish first basemen you already know can hit big league pitching
neither scout want to be quote by name discuss a player his team may end up bidding on
bjarkman note that abreu 's prodigious number come in a league that be leak talent as more and more player leave the country
some pitcher in cuba he say throw between 80 and 85 mile per hour which be almost akin to bat practice in the major
his number in the cuban league be great but they come against some very mediocre pitching bjarkman say
for the national team he drop off a bit
if there be a question it ' whether he can adjust as quickly to the better pitching as the cuban player who have be so good in the major
sigfredo barros a baseball writer for the cuban newspaper granma say sometimes it can be very hard to tell with the cuban player
not everyone can be puig
right now abreu be work to establish residency in haiti so he can legally work in the united states
if he come directly he could work immediately but he would have be subject to the amateur draft and deprive of his lucrative free agency
in addition major league baseball 's new interpretation of regulation from the treasury department 's office of foreign assets control mean abreu will face a long wait before he be clear
in the past cuban defector need only to prove permanent residency in a country outside cuba
now baseball require player to petition the foreign assets office a process that can take several month
praver shapiro sports management which have handle other cubans like pitcher livan hernandez will represent abreu
last summer the agency negotiate a nine year $ 30 million contract for another cuban client jorge soler who sign with the chicago cubs
abreu be expect to have a showcase for scout in the dominican republic this month at which point the hype will probably grow
where it lead remain to be see
washington the foreign intelligence surveillance court on tuesday offer its most extensive public explanation for why it have allow the government to keep record of all americans phone call release a previously classify opinion in which it say the program be constitutional and do not violate americans privacy right
while the once secret call log program have be periodically reapproved by the court since 2006 it have come under criticism from member of congress of both party and civil libertarian since its existence come to public light in june after leak by the former national security agency contractor edward j. snowden
in a 29-page opinion that quote the n.s.a. director keith alexander as say the leak have cause significant and irreversible damage to national security judge claire v. eagan a federal judge in the northern district of oklahoma declare that the program be lawful
so she write any decision about whether to keep it be a political question not a legal one
this court be mindful that this matter come before it at a time when unprecedented disclosure have be make about this and other highly sensitive program design to obtain foreign intelligence information and carry out counterterrorism investigation she write add in the wake of these disclosure whether and to what extent the government seek to continue the program discuss in this memorandum opinion be a matter for the political branch to decide
the opinion by judge eagan a 2001 appointee of president george w. bush who be assign to the surveillance court by chief justice john g. roberts jr. this year also note that no telecommunication company have invoke its legal right to object to turn over its customer call record to the government
to date no holder of record who have receive an order to produce bulk telephony metadata have challenge the legality of such an order she write
the opinion date aug. 29 be the first write since the program come to light
while other judge have routinely reauthorized the program every 90 day with only brief reiteration of the court 's legal analysis accord to an official familiar with the still classified ruling judge eagan write the lengthy memorandum apparently for the purpose of public release
judge eagan note in her opinion that the court have previously reauthorized the program to continue for another three month on july 19 after have hold an extensive hearing to receive testimony and evidence on this matter

in a footnote she say that only the government and not opponent of the program participate in the hearing as be routine for such proceeding
james r. clapper the director of national intelligence laud the opinion as one that affirm that the bulk telephony metadata collection be both lawful and constitutional
in a statement he say its release be consistent with president obama 's call for more transparency on these valuable intelligence program
but jameel jaffer a senior attorney at the american civil liberties union call the opinion completely unpersuasive criticize it for fail to mention a landmark privacy case decide by the supreme court last year and portray its statutory analysis as equally weak
on the whole the opinion only confirm the folly of entrust privacy right to a court that hear argument only from the government he say
the legal analysis judge eagan endorse echo the basic argument that the obama administration have make in defend the program since it come to light include in an unsigned justice department white paper it release last month
among those argument be that phone call metadata phone number time and duration of call but not content be not protect by fourth amendment privacy right because it do not involve eavesdropping on the content of call
she also agree that the government have legal authority to collect all calling record from phone company under a provision of the patriot act that allow it to obtain business record deem relevant to an investigation and that member of congress have have an opportunity to learn how the patriot act be secretly be interpret before lawmaker reauthorized the law
the program trace its origin to one aspect of the bush administration 's expansion of surveillance outside statutory or judicial framework after the terrorist attack of sept. 11 2001
it be later bring under the authority of the surveillance court and link to the patriot act
the security agency use the database to perform link analysis see who may have be in contact directly or indirectly with terrorism suspect in hope of identify hidden cell
under rule impose by the court the agency may search for phone call only if there be reasonable articulable suspicion that the underlie phone number be link to terrorism
in explain why the court have reauthorized the program judge eagan say that accord to the government there be no compliance incident violation of the rule limit how the database may be access by analyst in the previous three month period
last week the government release document by another judge on the foreign intelligence surveillance court relate to a 2009 reprimand of the security agency for violate the rule and for mislead the court about how it be use the database
it have come to light that the agency be automatically compare each day 's fresh batch of phone data with an alert list of thousand of number its analyst have flag only about 10 percent of which meet the standard of the court impose rule
the court be aware that in prior year there have be incident of noncompliance with respect to n.s.a. 's handling of produce information judge eagan write
through oversight by this court over a period of month those issue be resolve
the census bureau report yesterday that the poverty rate in america hold stable between 2011 and 2012 at about 15 percent
accord to the official measure poverty today be high than it be in 1973 when it reach a historical low of 11.1 percent
to many this dismaying fact suggest that taxpayer waste billion of dollar a year fight a war on poverty that have be largely lose
as representative paul d. ryan republican of wisconsin say earlier this year we have spend $ 15 trillion from the federal government fight poverty and look at where we be the high poverty rate in a generation 15 percent of americans in poverty
but this position be wrong for two reason
the first be that the official measure be misleading it measure only cash income and it do not count benefit from many program that help the poor
if they be count the rate would be close to 11 percent
consider the supplemental nutrition assistance program commonly know as food stamp which be first put into nationwide use in the 1960
the immediate benefit be easy to calculate a dollar of snap subsidy spend on food free up a dollar for low income family to spend on rent utility or other need
when snap benefit be count as income they lift almost four million people above the poverty line
and snap benefit not only reduce food insecurity and poverty this year they also reduce poverty in the next generation
recent research that track child into adulthood find that family access to food stamp improve their infant health and birth weight
child who benefit from the program later post better health high educational attainment less heart disease and for woman great earnings and less reliance on welfare as adult
the earn income tax credit be also ignore in calculate the poverty rate
yet this program offer work low income family with child about $ 3,000 a year
when these tax refund be count they reduce the number of people in poverty by about 5.5 million people
social security benefit be count in the official measure but their large antipoverty effect receive little attention
without these benefit the elderly poverty rate would have be more than 44 percent instead of the actual rate of less than 9 percent
the next time critic of the safety net claim that we fight a war on poverty and poverty win remind them that without these and other program poverty would be much high
but say the critic if all these program have such broad effect why have the poverty rate stay so frustratingly stable
that ' the second flaw in the conventional wisdom
all thing be equal such program whether we count them or not should have reduce the official poverty rate across generation
but all thing have not be equal
although these program help the poor poverty remain high because inequality of economic outcome have increase sharply since the 1970
before income inequality take off the poverty rate fall more rapidly with g.d.p. growth
but while the economy grow by 2.8 percent in 2012 and corporate profit go up as a share of national income the earnings of full time worker median household income and the poverty rate barely change
antipoverty program do help but their recipient do not move forward because they no longer benefit much from that other great poverty ameliorating factor economic growth
that ' not to say that growth be no longer necessary for reduce poverty
but in our gilded age of inequality growth alone be insufficient
a few change would make a difference
first a poverty measure that incorporate all anti poverty policy would show that the safety net be more effective than critic say and would show how painful cut to those program could be
in fact the census bureau have already develop a supplemental measure that reveal the importance of these program to low income family
but when it be release next month it will receive far less attention than the official rate from policy maker and the press
second more benefit from growth must reach the poor and the best way to do that be through match robust antipoverty measure with policy that lower the unemployment rate and increase wage
during the full employment year of the late 1990 even low wage rise in step with productivity and poverty fall more sharply than it have in a generation
a minimum wage increase help then and an increase now would help again
lower poverty mean both recognize the success of safety net program we now have and devise new policy that can spread the gain generate by economic growth
if we do n't then we will continue to face poverty rate that be unacceptably high and wonder why we can not do anything about them

i be at a conference in bern switzerland last week and struggle with my column
news of russia 's proposal for syria to surrender its poison ga be just break and change every hour force me to rewrite my column every hour
to clear my head i go for a walk along the aare river on schifflaube street
along the way i find a small grocery shop and stop to buy some nectarine
as i go to pay i be look down fish for my swiss franc and when i look up at the cashier i be take aback he have pink hair
a huge shock of neon pink hair very euro punk from the 90
while he be ring me up a young woman walk by and he blow her a kiss through the window not a care in the world
observe all this joie de vivre i think to myself wow would not it be nice to be a swiss
maybe even to sport some pink hair
though i can not say for sure i get the feeling that the man with pink hair be not agonize over the proper use of force against bashar al assad
not his fault his be a tiny country
i guess worry about syria be the tax you pay for be an american or an american president and come from the world 's strong power that still believe blessedly in my view that it have to protect the global common
barack obama once have black hair
but his be gray now not pink
that ' also the tax you pay for think about the middle east too much it lead to either gray hair or no hair but not pink hair
well bring on the grecian formula because our leader will need it
my big take away from the whole syria imbroglio be that with europe ail china awol and the arab world convulse for an american president to continue to lead will require more help from vladimir putin because our president will get less help from everyone else include the american people
everyone be focus on obama 's unimpressive leadership in this crisis but for my money the two main player who shape the outcome in way that would not have be predict but will have huge long term implication be putin and the american people
obama get blindside by both
what do it tell us
the fact that americans overwhelmingly tell congress to vote against bomb syria for its use of poison ga tell how much the divide on this issue in america be not leave versus right but top versus bottom
intervene in syria be drive by elite and debate by elite
it be not a base issue
i think many americans could not understand why it be o.k. for us to let 100,000 syrians die in a civil war/uprising but we have to stop everything and bomb the country because 1,400 people be kill with poison ga
i and others make a case why indeed we need to redraw that red line but many americans seem to think that all we be do be draw a red line in a pool of blood
who would even notice
many americans also understand that when it come to our record in the arab/muslim world since 9/11 we be 0 for 3
afghanistan seem head for failure whatever happen in iraq it be overpay for and libya saw a tyrant replace by tribal war
i also think a lot of people look at the rebel in syria and hear too few people who sound like nelson mandela that be people fight for the right to be equal citizen not just for the triumph of their sect or shariah
it ' why john mccain 's soar interventionist rhetoric be greet with a no sale
i also think the public pick up on obama 's ambivalence his churchillian this must not stand rhetoric clash with his on second thought i be go to ask congress 's permission before i make a stand and i wo not call lawmaker back from vacation to do so
the bombing be go to be big than a pinprick but also unbelievably small
it just do not add up
finally there be an be you kid
question lurk beneath it all a sense that with middle class income stagnate income gap widen and unemployment still pervasive for both white- and blue collar worker a lot of americans be ask this be the emergency you be put before congress
syria
really
this be the red line you want to draw
i be out of work but this syria thing be what shall not stand
as for putin if he have not intervene with his proposal to get syria to surrender all its chemical weapon obama would have have to either bomb syria without congressional approval or slink away
so why do putin save obama
in part no doubt because he feel the only way he could save his client the syrian president be by also save the american president
but the big factor be that putin really want to be see as a big relevant global leader
it both feed his ego and play well with his base
the question now be with the american people sideline and putin headline can we leverage putin 's intervention to join us in also forge a cease fire in syria and maybe even move on to jointly try to end the iran nuclear crisis
i agree with obama on this no matter how we get here we 're in a potentially better place
so let 's press it
let 's really test how far putin will go with us
i be skeptical but it ' worth a try
otherwise obama 's hair will not just be turn gray by the middle east these next three year he will go bald
representative aaron schock be a conservative republican from illinois but not conservative enough for the hard right activist group club for growth which be seek someone to run against him in next year 's primary
his crime
in 2011 he vote to increase the debt ceiling and in 2012 he vote for a stopgap spending bill that prevent a government shutdown
in neither case do he demand the defunding of health care reform
club for growth and other extremist group consider a record like his an unforgivable failure and they be raise and spend million to make sure that no republicans will take similar position in the next few week when the fiscal year end and the debt limit expire
if you 're wonder why so many house republicans seem to believe they can force president obama to accept a defunding of the health care reform law by threaten a government shutdown or a default it ' because these group have promise to inflict political pain on any republican official who do not go along
heritage action and the senate conservatives fund have each release scorecard show which lawmaker have pledge to defund obamacare
when a senator like tom coburn of oklahoma refuse to pledge right wing activist be tell please contact senator coburn and tell him it ' dishonest to say you oppose obamacare but then vote to fund it
tell him he swear an oath to support and defend the constitution
mr. schock and 10 other lawmaker consider suspiciously squishy by the club for growth be designate as rino 's republicans in name only and the club have vow to find primary opponent and support them with cash a formidable threat consider that it spend $ 18 million backing conservative candidate in the 2012 cycle
americans for prosperity a koch brother group that have already spend million on ad fight health reform be begin a new campaign to delay the law 's effect
these group all finance with secret and unlimited money fee on chaos and would like nothing better than to claim credit for push washington into another crisis
win an ideological victory be far more important to them than the severe economic effect of a shutdown or bad a default which could shatter the credit market
they also have another reason for their attack fund raising
all their web site push the defunding scheme include a big donate button for the faithful to push
with your donation you will be send a strong message obamacare must be defunded now say the web site of the national liberty federation another social welfare group that see dollar sign in shut down the government
brian walsh a longtime republican operative recently note in u.s. news and world report that the right be now spend more money attack republicans than the democrats be
money beget tv ad which beget even more money for these group personal coffer he write
point finger and attack republicans be apparently a very profitable fund raise business
it may be good for their bank account but the combination of unlimited money and rigid ideology be prove toxic for the most basic functioning of government

it have be just over 100 day since the disturbing disclosure of the government 's vast and continue sweep of americans phone and internet record authorize by congress and approve by a secret court issue secret opinion on critical element of constitutional law
since then the debate over the balance between national security and individual privacy have evolve rapidly with each new disclosure from edward snowden
take the word of the director of national intelligence james clapper jr. who in march deny to the senate intelligence committee that the government be collect the very data
we now know it have be collect for year
after the surveillance be expose mr. clapper make the orwellian claim that his earlier denial be the least untruthful response he could give in light of the classified nature of the program
last week mr. clapper tell a roomful of intelligence contractor that the conversation trigger by mr. snowden 's leak actually need to happen and may represent a good side to what intelligence official consider a calamitous security breach
conversation be meaningless of course without information and there too some progress be be make include a remarkable ruling last week by the foreign intelligence surveillance court
the court order the government to review for possible release the court 's opinion about the phone record program
the leak along with court opinion and order the government have since declassify have engender considerable public interest and debate about the interpretation and application of specific provision of the patriot act judge f. dennis saylor iv write
further publication of court ruling would contribute to an informed debate the judge add particularly about whether the law should be change or we would add the program themselves
judge saylor be not alone
on tuesday afternoon the court declassify an august opinion by judge claire eagan authorize another sweep of telephone data
judge eagan have request that the ruling be release because of public interest
the release of judicial opinion would not normally be notable in a constitutional democracy premise on open court but the foreign intelligence surveillance court have be anything but normal
the government be justify in classify certain information regard national security operation but in most case there be no good rationale for the classification of judicial interpretation of law
the government 's argument that the legal analysis be inextricably intertwine with secret may be true in some case but its blanket invocation have weaken its strength
last week judge saylor write that further publication of the court 's order would also assure citizen of the integrity of this court 's proceeding
we will not know until we see behind the curtain

the coal industry and its allies be angry about president obama 's energy policy and they have decide to take it out on his nominee to lead the federal energy regulatory commission which regulate the interstate transmission of electricity natural ga and oil
the commission have no regulatory authority over coal
but that do not matter to the industry
it have come out against ronald binz the nominee because he support clean fuel when he be a state energy regulator
as the chairman of the colorado public utility commission he help colorado lawmaker tighten standard on coal fire power plant cause some old plan to shut down and be replace by natural ga plant
those new rule be help to reduce emission and improve the state 's air quality
one of the coal industry 's chief complaint against mr. binz be that he overstep his authority in his colorado post they refuse to acknowledge that a court rule against that claim
mr. binz 's critic which include the far right and some senate republicans want to block his appointment because they say he would encourage the construction of transmission line that will bring power generate by wind farm to urban area
they also argue that he would undermine conventional fossil fuel by stand in the way of new oil and ga pipeline
his record however show he be no ideologue
the coal lobby and the american energy alliance which be partly finance by the koch brother be hop that their misleading campaign against mr. binz will convince some democrats like joe manchin of west virginia and mary landrieu of louisiana to oppose his nomination
senator should ignore the attack from vest special interest many of whom deny the existence of climate change and confirm mr. binz

the overuse of antibiotic in medicine and agriculture have long be know to foster the emergence of germ that be resistant to drug
on monday the centers for disease control and prevention issue the first solid number on the extent of the problem
it say that at least two million americans fall ill from antibiotic resistant infection each year of whom at least 23,000 die from the infection a very conservative estimate
the agency warn of potentially catastrophic consequence unless prompt action be take
it say that up to half of the antibiotic prescribe for people be not need or appropriately use as when a broad spectrum antibiotic be use instead of a more target drug
overuse of antibiotic on farm where they be often use to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animal also contribute to development of resistant strain of germ
the new report for the first time put 17 drug resistant bacteria and a dangerous fungus into three category base on how big a threat they pose
three be deem urgent threat include a bacterium know as cre that be resistant to most drug and kill a high percentage of people who become infected with it
though it be rare cause 600 death a year it have be identify in health facility in 44 state
further spread of the germ or transfer of its resistance gene to other germ could lead to a nightmare scenario the agency say
twelve drug resistant strain include such common germ as salmonella tuberculosis and mrsa be classify as serious threat

san francisco officially there be no action in the america 's cup on tuesday
the combination of a strong ebb tide and wind in san francisco bay force official to cancel both scheduled race
that mean the challenger emirates team new zealand still have a 7 1 lead and still need just two victory to win the old major trophy in global sport from oracle team usa.
but unofficially there be always action at this sink or swim stage of the cup which even after 162 year have the high profile and high stake of any sailing event
win it and a team get everything that matter include the chance to stage the next cup where it choose and to a large degree how it choose
lose it and a team become just another prospective challenger at the mercy of the wind and whim of the defender
give the many million of dollar that the oracle owner larry ellison have lavish on this cup so far for so little reward or public appreciation challenge or even abstain may seem a better business plan at this stage
but there still do not appear to be another winner take all formula quite as extreme as the america 's cup in elite sport and although the interview on the dock be cordial and coherent tuesday the sailor and the big specialized team that support them all know that their job be likely to end if the cup end in defeat
oracle team employee continue to talk comeback cite australia ii 's rally from a 1 3 deficit against liberty in the 1983 cup which end the americans 132-year win streak
but the odds remain heavily in team new zealand 's favor and on tuesday in the america 's cup park at pier 27 the end feel near with 50 percent discount on all america 's cup apparel in the official store and with fan snap up hat and shirt before snap image of the two 72-foot catamaran as their crew prepare to dock out to no avail
with their huge wing sail surprisingly thin in profile mirror the vertical of coit tower and the transamerica pyramid in the distance it be an evocative scene
a peaceful scene too with the sunlight playing trick with the undulation in the water
but peaceful be far from the mood behind the scene
team new zealand with significant government money but no guarantee of more need the victory to guarantee its survival
oracle team usa with ellison surely hesitate about whether to keep lavish many more million on something he have already win be in the survival business too

he love to be a challenger and he love new zealand say bruno trouble the former america 's cup helmsman turn cup organizer
but maybe if he lose he will focus on his island now on his new personal country
that would be the hawaiian island of lanai which ellison purchase nearly in its entirety last year
but for this week at least ellison remain on what hawaiians call the mainland as his design team and sailor explore and re explore every possible tweak that may keep the momentum in their direction
ask for detail on their work be usually about as productive as ask an n.f.l. coach what he learn from watch game film
what be clear be that oracle have manage to narrow the gap in the last week win two of the last three race and get a true point on the board after start the cup with a two race penalty impose by an international jury
the jury find that the team have break rule in preliminary regatta in small boat
oracle 's leader remain privately furious about that judgment which also deprive them of their lead wing sail trimmer dirk de ridder who be suspend
a post regatta legal challenge from oracle can not be rule out if it lose particularly if the final score be close
meanwhile oracle have narrow the gap on the water in large part by improve its upwind speed significantly
there be probably four or five change to the boat all visible to the naked eye so i will challenge you to find them say dirk kramers a design executive for oracle
team new zealand apparently have not find them all yet
i 'm at least three or four behind joke perhaps
nick holroyd the technical director for team new zealand who sit next to kramers at a news conference tuesday
what come through in that exchange be the techie thrill they and so many others have feel at be part of the new and fast generation of cup yacht
i 'm like a kid in a candy store here kramers say
the rule govern the candy store shift significantly in may after andrew simpson a sailor with the challenger artemis racing die when the team 's ac72 capsize during training in san francisco bay
this cup which have bring the venerable event into the extreme sport era be also suppose to allow the team to compete in a wide range of wind condition and avoid the cancellation that have hurt its appeal and marketability
the original wind limit for the cup match be 33 knot
but after simpson 's death and extensive negotiation cup official lower the upper range to 23 knot and the ebb tide lower it further tuesday
as frustrating as it may seem i think the safety rule be in place for all the right reason say ken read a former cup helmsman who be now a television analyst
team new zealand be once the team push for high wind limit but with oracle appear to thrive in the upper range in the last few day the new zealanders be now all for extra caution
oracle official make a request on monday 's day off to raise the wind limit by one knot
they also propose that race no longer be stop once they have begin if the wind increase which happen on saturday
i think now the crew be so expert and the boat be hopefully very fit say tom ehman the vice commodore of the golden gate yacht club and a key member of oracle 's brain trust

so you can do some thing that maybe three or four month ago do not seem reasonable
reasonable or not oracle 's proposal which require mutual consent be reject by team new zealand which should come as no surprise at this all or nothing phase of another america 's cup when mutual consent be every bit as elusive as job security

donor many of them longtime backer of his enjoy hors d'oeuvre and view of the lower manhattan skyline while he speak of the important work to be do on issue like job and the economy
not a single check be write to mr. christie 's campaign
indeed some of those in attendance be legally prohibit from do so because they have sizable contract with state agency and be therefore bar by new jersey law from make large contribution to the governor
instead the donor write check for as much as $ 100,000 to the republican governors association an organization mr. christie help lead that have collect $ 1.65 million from new jersey donor during the first six month of the year
the association have in turn pour $ 1.7 million into mr. christie 's re election effort with television advertisement attack state senator barbara buono his democratic opponent in the election this year
mr. christie 's close relationship with the association provide a playbook for how carefully choreograph independent spending campaign can undermine the rule mean to curtail the political influence of government contractor new jersey 's pay to play law strictly limit the participation of state contractor in political giving
accord to an analysis by the new york times a third of the $ 1.65 million the association raise in new jersey come from people and business who have significant contract with the state or from utility which be prohibit from make any contribution to candidate for governor
that money have help set the stage for what christie allies hope will be an overwhelming re election victory this november in a democratic lean state boost his prospect go into the 2016 presidential race
i do not view it as a workaround say wayne j. positan a lawyer who attend the may fund raiser and whose firm have earn hundred of thousand of dollar in new state work since mr. christie take office
i view it as make a contribution to the r.g.a. he add and they provide a really good forum for governor to work together
mr. christie be to become chairman of the association next year a high profile position that will further strengthen his relationship with national republican donor and give him a prominent platform in national politics as he consider a presidential candidacy
governor christie have be very active in the r.g.a. say gail gitcho a spokeswoman for the association
he be help raise money for the mammoth cycle we have next year with 36 statewide race across the country

one group a nonprofit organization call one new jersey have already spend $ 2.8 million on television and radio ad attack mr. christie for oppose tax increase on the wealthy and for veto an increase in the minimum wage

a decade be a sprint less time than since 9/11 to use one benchmark
the scientist want to lift the hood and get a look at the human mind
the student in a seminar at fordham university school of law teach by prof
deborah w. denno wonder what that will mean for the law
over and over they put question to a guest speaker joshua r. sanes director of the center for brain science at harvard about the implication for society if and when brain science can identify with confidence a propensity for violence or for lie
he bat it right back at them
you tell me dr. sanes say
it ' a huge issue
i wish i have something smart to say
last year president obama announce that the federal government would create a brain initiative to speed up the development of tool that can track how the brain work and how it break
it be not hard to imagine the benefit begin with more carefully target treatment for people afflict with psychiatric ailment
there have not be a brand new type of drug for antidepression or autism or schizophrenia bipolar disorder or o.c.d. in something like 25 year dr. sanes say
this be where we have to make a long term investment and come up with some new type of help because what we be do be not work
work on animal have show in broad stroke how information get into the head and process but current imaging tool can not keep up with the brain 's processing speed or be not powerful enough to follow the molecular transaction involve in pass information and create thought
dr. sanes have make close study of the retina which he call a beautiful part of the brain
he rat the human eye as a 100-megapixel camera with 100 million light receptor cell
the eye also have layer of cell assign to detect color contrast edge and various motion especially of object rise up
from all these cell the brain get 30 different representation of an image which it somehow assemble into a coherent whole
you 've never see reality the way it be he say

by the time it get to the brain it have be decompose
the brain just throw away 90 percent of the information because the brain 's job be to keep you alive
that mean edit out information that do not pertain to predator or to prey
at some point we develop a cortex dr. sanes say
the cortex be kind of in charge of make us think we have actually see something
many discovery have be make during treatment of certain epileptic patient who can only be help if a doctor sever misfire part of the brain
because the brain have no pain receptor patient be awake and can describe what they be experience as their neuron be stimulate something a mouse can not do
and it turn out that there be a jennifer aniston neuron
the neuroscientist find a neuron that would fire when it saw a picture of jennifer aniston dr. sanes say
it would not fire for any of the other people from friend or a table or a car
what evolutionary edge a person get from such a neuron await more study
it be now believe that diseased circuit cause diseased brain which we experience as psychiatric disorder dr. sanes say
a student brittany taylor ask what such broken structure would mean if they cause somebody to commit a crime
be we go to look at that as a mitigate circumstance or be we go to have to change our culpability standard completely
she ask
what if other part of the brain be involve or if environmental factor be influence the neuron
could someone say with confidence that the neuron make him do it
science have a limit dr. sanes say
you 're go to have all this information and you 're not go to know
but he assure them that they need to be ready
knowledge from the human genome project of the genetic code will amplify or complicate brain mapping effort which be know as the human connectome
fifteen year from now somebody be go to say it ' the 489th neuron from the back of your ear that make you do it along with a mutant gene dr. sanes say
that ' go to be hard to dismiss

detail bury in the united nations report on the syrian chemical weapon attack point directly at elite military formation loyal to president bashar al assad some of the strong finding to date that suggest the government gas its own people
the inspector instruct to investigate the attack but not to assign blame nonetheless list the precise compass direction of flight for two rocket strike that appear to lead back toward the government 's elite redoubt in damascus mount qasioun which overlook and protect neighborhood and mr. assad 's presidential palace and where his republican guard and the army 's powerful fourth division be entrenched
it be the center of gravity of the regime say elias hanna a retired general in the lebanese army and a lecturer on strategy and geopolitics at the american university of beirut
it be the core of the regime
in present the data concern two rocket strike the significance of which be not comment upon by the united nations itself the report provide a strong indication than the public statement of intelligence service of the united states france or britain that the syrian military not only carry out the attack but apparently do so brazenly fire from the same neighborhood or ridge from which it have be fire high explosive conventional munition for much of the war
loom over a tense capital and outlying neighborhood bristle with anger and fear mount qasioun be damascus 's most prominent military position
it be also a complex inseparably link to the assad family 's rule a network of compound and position occupy by elite unit lead by member of the president 's inner circle and clan
the unit base on the mountain be as close to the assad regime as it ' go to get say emile hokayem an analyst at the international institute for strategic studies
mr. hokayem add that theory that the chemical have be launch by a rebel mole seek to discredit the government be unlikely because of the solidity and tight control of those unit
mr. assad 's government and its ally russia have continue to claim publicly that syrian rebel be responsible for the attack which kill hundred of people many of them child in the most lethal chemical warfare attack in decade
but the united nations data if accurate would undercut that claim and appear to erase some of the remain ambiguity
rebel force have never penetrate the major military installation of mount qasioun
in tactical and technical term they would almost certainly have be unable to organize and fire sustained and complex barrage of rocket from that location undetected
the united nations evidence be gather through standard measurement and investigative technique at the place where sarin fill rocket strike on aug. 21
at one impact site investigator find both the place where the rocket have pass through a vegetal screen above a wall just before it hit the ground and the small impact crater itself
they note that the line link the crater and the piercing of the vegetal screen can be conclusively establish and have a bearing of 35 degree
at another impact area in another section of damascus a 330-millimeter rocket land on what investigator describe as earthy relatively soft ground where the shaft/engine of the projectile remain dug in undisturbed until investigate
the rocket 's shaft the investigator note point precisely in a bearing of 285 degree
there the investigator public comment about their observation at impact site essentially stop except for a parting explanation that show how to reach a conclusion that the united nations itself in accordance with its mandate do not say
these azimuth or compass bearing they note can be reverse to show the direction from which the rocket have be fire
they point back toward the geographic source of the attack which investigator on the ground presumably would have be able with their own eye to see high above them in the city 1 2 next page

the police have express skepticism that either victim do what mr. torres describe as have provoke him to stab them

a law enforcement official say he have undergo a psychiatric evaluation but decline to give the result
police official say that mr. torres have not be formally charge with the earlier stabbing assault though such charge be likely

washington for four year president obama count on fellow democrats to rally to his side in a series of epic battle with republicans over the direction of the country
but now deep in his fifth year in office mr. obama find himself frustrated by member of his own party weary of his leadership and increasingly willing to defy him
in recent week disgruntle democrats particularly liberal have bolt from the white house on issue like national security agency surveillance policy a planned military strike on syria and the potential choice of lawrence h. summers to lead the federal reserve
in private they often sound exasperated describe mr. obama 's operation in public they be sometimes only a little more restrained
they complain the white house have not consult enough and fail to assert leadership
they say mr. obama have be too passive and cede momentum to republicans
their grievance be sometimes contradictory some grouse that he take on cause he can not win while others say he do not fight hard enough for principled position
the failure to enact tighten gun control law and the republican hold on immigration legislation have leave liberal little to celebrate this year
if you read the paper you almost think the republicans be in control say senator bernard sanders of vermont an independent who caucus with democrats and vigorously oppose mr. summers until he withdraw from consideration
they 're constantly on the offensive
democrats be on the defensive
the lack of strong leadership he add have create a vacuum
i think you 're go to see more independent say mr. president we look forward to work with you but we 're not simply go to accept your leadership and your ideas,'â he say
â we 're not go to follow you
you 're go to have to work with us.'â mr. obama 's trouble with democrats be not unusual for a second term and could be temporary or episodic
with re election behind him member of his party see no need to stick with him to secure another four year
they be also look ahead to the next election earlier than usual with the emergence of hillary rodham clinton as a front runner
by the end of his fifth year president bill clinton have alienate liberal with the north american free trade agreement a welfare overhaul and a balanced budget deal with republicans
president george w. bush in his fifth and sixth year be in bad shape with republicans who shelve his social security overhaul rebel against the deteriorate iraq war and help sink his supreme court nomination of harriet e. miers

it make it a lot harder when it ' your own party say peter h. wehner a top bush aide at the time
you can not fire back with the same intensity and vehemence as when it ' the other party
and it just change the dynamic people expect you to be criticize by the other party
when your own party do it it ' an indication of weakness
the internecine tension present a challenge to mr. obama as he head into renewed budget war with congress
it make a political life for him that ' already hard even harder say jared bernstein a former obama white house economist
the gridlock he face from republicans especially in the house be extremely obstructionist to his agenda so when he run into democrats who be block him it become insurmountable
the white house discount suggestion of trouble with congressional democrats and produce voting statistic show that with the exception of mr. bush mr. obama have more support from his own party in his first four year than any president through dwight d. eisenhower
democrats stand behind him on health care wall street regulation and budget battle
president obama have receive unprecedented support from his party in congress say dan pfeiffer his senior adviser
of course we wo not agree on everything all the time every family have its squabble but the periodic disagreement in the democratic party pale in comparison to the epic existential civil war for the soul of the republican party that be lead to so much dysfunction
the white house 's statistic show that senate democrats vote with mr. obama more than 90 percent of the time over his first four year compare with mr. clinton who have support in the 80 percent range over a similar period and president ronald reagan whose party vote with him in the 70 percent range 1 2 next page

to the editor bravo to joyce maynard for finally say what should have be say year ago
i only wish that j. d. salinger be alive to read it
his relationship with teenage girl amount to little more than child abuse
i fall for holden caulfield when i be 12 as do every girl who read mr. salinger 's iconic novel the catcher in the rye and i can understand how young woman would have be suck into his creator 's magnetic sacrosanct world
where be it write that woman be not allow to talk about what happen to them
the world buy into mr. salinger 's convenient for him self serve rule that his privacy be more important than anyone else 's well being
of course j. d. salinger be not alone in his treatment of woman
hemingway picasso and score of others could easily join the rank
it ' about time woman speak up
irene goodman kamaroff new york sept. 15 2013
to the editor we believe that sell the fantasy of fertility by miriam zoll and pamela tsigdinos op ed sept. 12 paint an incomplete picture of the likely success of infertility treatment
despite the dramatic advance in medicine of the last 30 year it be true that not every infertility patient will get pregnant but patient and the public deserve to have all the fact
among those fact be that assist reproductive technology treatment have result in the birth of more than five million baby around the world and while it sometimes take more than one attempt more than 60 percent of woman who undergo treatment eventually end up with a baby
we like the writer recognize the tremendous emotional distress that can result for patient whose treatment be not successful and hence the need to have transparency and full disclosure of available data for decision making in infertility therapy and cop with the emotional aspect that accompany it
linda c. giudice president american society for reproductive medicine washington sept. 12 2013
to the editor in my experience the obvious off ramp from fertility madness be adoption through my state 's foster care system
my ultimate goal be to be a parent not necessarily to pass along my gene procreate experience pregnancy or any of the myriad reason people have for pursue infertility treatment
my two daughter be gorgeous and healthy
do n't give up the fight
to the contrary it ' the best thing i ever do
lauren mufson clifton n.j. sept. 12 2013 to the editor another consequence of the magical thinking market by the fertility industry be the unrealistic expectation that any woman no matter how old can have a baby
as a nearly 41-year old first time bride i be shocked at how many people take it for grant that i could and would have a child
my effort to educate them on basic human biology fall on deaf ear
be not it enough i think that i have already beat one set of odds by marry in middle age
the fantasy that all woman can and should have child be perniciously pervasive as well as highly profitable for the field of reproductive medicine
the cold hard truth be that the majority of woman over 40 wo not conceive
i guess a lot of people just do not want to believe that
julie lloyd washington sept. 12 2013 to the editor be the 59,446 baby bear in the united states from assist reproductive technology during the last reporting year a fantasy
be the fertility business as the op ed writer bitterly call it offer just hype or be it really hope
would they deny cancer sufferer the hope of continue treatment once the initial treatment do not offer a complete cure
the american society for reproductive medicine have do an excellent job in minimize hype by impose strict advertising guideline in report success rate
success rate for each practice be publish online at sart.org for all to see
the success rate in a woman 's age group for the specialist she plan to use be far more important than some global failure rate
but the quest for a child can be so overwhelming that many do not want that dose of reality
in my experience usually it be the couple that continue the fight long after the fertility specialist have recommend move on to another method of family building
the writer be correct on one point as in the kenny rogers song the gambler you get to know when to hold 'em know when to fold em arthur l. wisot redondo beach calif. sept. 12 2013
the writer a fertility specialist with reproductive partners be the co author of conceptions misconceptions
to the editor as i read sell the fantasy of fertility i feel a profound relief that i confront my own infertility over 30 year ago before the medical industry 's focus on biological parenting have become so advanced and seductive
my adopt son look nothing like me but my son he be
to parent with or without replicate one 's own gene or experience birth be the core experience to embrace or decline

to the editor re pierce the mystery of potter 's field the city life editorial page sept. 11 while i be grateful to be credit with help to get new york city to open its book and provide personal identity information for recent burial on hart island there need to be great effort to provide access to graf and digital location information

last month lawyer for the hart island project a public charity host a database of over 60,000 adult and infant burial between 1980 and 2013 file an appeal to the department 's denial of a freedom of information request for gps information
one of the problem arise from allow the prison system to serve as city sexton be that the storytelling traditionally associate with visit graf become block
in addition to digital access to grave site we encourage the public to submit story and photo
they will soon be post in an interactive feature call the traveling cloud museum that i hope will mitigate the distress of those deny access to the graf while the city council further consider a bill introduce to transfer jurisdiction of the island to the department of parks and recreation

on the day when she announce only hour earlier that she have submit her resignation to take another job she continue there ' something wrong here when we have these multiple shooting these multiple injury

president obama also give a speech monday talk at the white house while the drama unfold at the supposedly secure navy yard nearby
he could have post his original remark on the white house web site and replace them with a cri de coeur on gun control or comfort for the shake city
the 12 who die be after all under his aegis as worker in a federal building
but jarringly the president go ahead with his political attack briefly address the slaughter before move on to jab republicans over the corporate tax rate and resistance to obamacare
just as with the address to the nation on syria last week the president go ahead with a speech overtake by event
it be out of joint give that the senate be put into lockdown and the washington nationals delay a night game against the atlanta braves note on its web site postpone tragedy
the man who connect so electrically and facilely in 2008 cause americans to overlook his thin resume can not seem to connect anymore
with a shrink circle of trust inside the white house obama be have trouble establish trust outside with once reliable faction grass root democrats and liberal in congress
as peter baker write in the times the president be find himself increasingly frustrated by the defiance of democrats who be despair of his passive reactive leadership
senator jon tester a democrat from montana on the banking committee tell jonathan martin for politico in february after he scrap through to a second term that the president be not engage with the hill that he have not meet with obama at the white house since 2010 and that he be sorely missing aide like rahm emanuel who tirelessly work and stroke democrats in congress
tester be one of three democrats who spurn the president on his favorite to run the federal reserve larry summers
the white house do not call tester until friday when it be too late summers be allow to twist in the wind like susan rice before him
top democrats who use to consider obama one cool cat now muse that he ' one weird cat as one big shot put it
obama still have a secret weapon congressional republicans who may yet shut down the government or cause a cataclysmic default and make the president look good
but for now puzzlement grow over the contrast between obama 's campaign leap and his govern lassitude
obama biographer richard wolffe note that the 2012 campaign have some of the same problem with leadership and direction but look good compare with the mid-20th century romney crowd who could not get an app to work
i do not know who they think they 're talk to or what they think they 're try to say say wolffe whose new book be the message the reselling of president obama
the president be a very muddled and entrenched figure who need to get out of a defensive crouch and get some fresh idea
unlike bill clinton who excel at boil down complex argument to simple one obama prefer to wallow in the weed remind people that he ' the smart man in the room and expect their support because he feel he be only do what ' complicated and right
but funnily enough as wolffe point out he ' more like the clintons than i ever think this white house would be with different faction and power base and personal rivalry
abc news 's george stephanopoulos ask the president about criticism of the administration 's serpentine syria policy cite a frustrated backer of the plan to strike syria senator bob corker a republican of tennessee
corker say that the career around leave obama diminished as president and he observe that the president seem cage in the role like he want to slip the noose
i think that folk here in washington like to grade on style obama say dismissively of his syria critic
but why be it so often the president 's style to be unable to sell the substance even on issue where most people agree with him
miami as many state prepare to introduce a linchpin of the 2010 health care law the insurance exchange design to make health care more affordable a handful of others be take the opposite tack they be complicate enrollment effort and limit information about the new program
chief among them be florida where gov. rick scott and the republican dominate legislature have make it more difficult for floridian to obtain the cheap insurance rate under the exchange and to get help from specially train outreach counselor
missouri and ohio two other state trouble by the affordable care act have also move to undercut the law and its insurance exchange set to open on oct. 1
in georgia the state insurance commissioner ralph t. hudgens have say he will do everything in our power to be an obstructionist
alarm by the resistance the secretary of health and human service kathleen sebelius and the obama administration be intensify their effort to win public support for the exchange in florida and elsewhere and be confront their critic head on
on tuesday ms. sebelius cap a three city visit to florida home to the country 's second large uninsured population with sharp word about the state 's unwillingness to embrace the law
she will do the same in missouri later this week
it ' unfortunate that keep information from people seem to be something of a pattern here in the state ms. sebelius say at a news conference in miami refer to restriction on outreach counselor
the online exchange be design to offer a variety of insurance plan at subsidized price and be mean to make health care more affordable to low income people who do not have insurance
outreach counselor know as navigator provide information about the plan and help enroll applicant
ms. sebelius also criticize florida 's rejection of $ 50 billion in federal money over 10 year to expand medicaid its concern about privacy issue which she say be unfounded and its sudden unwillingness to grapple with insurance rate
even among state hostile to the law florida become an outlier this year when it pass a bill remove for two year the state insurance commissioner 's ability to approve insurance rate for new health plan she say
this leave floridians vulnerable to high rate at a time when the new health plan will be introduce
in other state insurance commissioner use the law to obtain better deal for consumer to have the florida legislature pass a bill that for two year 2014 and 2015 remove rate review authority really put florida consumer at great risk ms. sebelius say add no one else have do that
ms. sebelius 's criticism be unlikely to inspire cooperation in florida or in the other state that vigorously oppose the law
mr. scott have be one of the law 's fierce opponent despite his decision to accept the $ 50 billion for medicaid expansion
but the florida house block that effort this year while mr. scott sit mostly on the sideline fail to lobby for the expansion lawmaker say
the state also choose not to run its own health care exchange leave it to the federal government
democrats say mr. scott and republican lawmaker continue to throw up roadblock
last week florida 's deputy health secretary order county health facility to bar navigator or outreach counselor
the health department say it be follow establish policy all outside group be prohibit from use county health property to conduct nonstate business
brochure though will be make available accord to a statement
no write request for space have be make by navigator a spokesman say
county health office be important in the campaign to reach potential applicant because they deal mostly with low income people who may not be insure
and on monday in a letter to the top republican and democrat in congress mr. scott raise concern about privacy say that navigator and others involve in the health care effort could use applicant information improperly
attorneys general from 13 state have express similar worry about the release of financial and medical information be it intentional or accidental
say that florida be ground zero in the obama administration 's campaign to enroll people mr. scott ask house speaker john a. boehner and the senate majority leader harry reid to thoroughly review what privacy rule and safeguard be in place
floridian should not have to exchange their privacy for insurance mr. scott write
ms. sebelius say on tuesday that she appreciate the governor 's concern but that her office which oversee medicare be use to deal with privacy issue
i can guarantee you we take that very very seriously which be why nobody will be collect personal health information at all at any point along the way she say
verifying yes store it no
florida be not the only state complicate the obama administration 's effort to roll out the new exchange
a missouri law adopt this year require the licensing of navigator and also restrict their activity
without that license the missouri law say navigator can not provide advice concern the benefit term and feature of a particular health plan or advise consumer about which health plan to choose
ohio have adopt a similar law state that navigator can distribute some information but can not recommend a plan or offer advice about benefit in a particular plan
in georgia the insurance commissioner mr. hudgens say his job be to protect consumer

to that end georgia mandatesâ that health insurance counselor be license to become navigator a process that require criminal background check and fingerprinting of applicant
for democrats the new state law and rule be just another way to throw up obstacle to try to defeat the affordable care act
they could not beat obamacare in congress where they have try 41 time to repeal it they could not beat it in the supreme court so they be try death by a thousand cut say representative debbie wasserman schultz a florida democrat and chairwoman of the democratic national committee
lizette alvarez report from miami and robert pear from washington
washington washington 's health care revolve door be spin fast as the new online health insurance marketplace a central provision of president obama 's health care law be set to open oct. 1
those who have a hand in the law 's passage be now find lucrative work in the private sector as business try to understand the complex measure reshape it by press for regulatory change or profit from it
that mean boom time for what may be call an obamacare cottage industry provide work for dozen of former administration and mostly democratic congressional official whose immersion in health policy minutia and friendship make them invaluable to private business
dr. dora hughes for example have a medical degree from vanderbilt and a master 's in public health from harvard and never envision join a law firm
but dr. hughes a former obama administration official have something washington lawyer and lobbying shop covet an insider 's understanding of the new health care law
after nearly four year as counselor to health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius she leave government last year to work for sidley austin which represent insurer pharmaceutical company device maker and others affect by the law
she be not a register lobbyist but rather a strategic adviser although some call that a distinction without a difference
health policy be what i do dr. hughes say in a recent interview
it ' what i have always do so i be not do anything differently
my work be not base only on relationship or try to curry favor
the health care industry now spend more money on lobby in washington than any sector of the economy more than $ 243 million last year alone slightly high than the $ 242 million spend by financial insurance and real estate company accord to the center for responsive politics here
of the revolving door lobbyist profile by the center those specialize in health care account for 12 percent more than any other economic sector
critic say these former official be cash in trading on the relationship and expertise they acquire while work for the taxpayer and cite such career move as proof that mr. obama have not live up to his promise to change the culture of influence peddle in the capital
liz fowler a onetime executive with wellpoint the insurer help draft the legislation as the chief health counsel for the senate finance committee and later join the administration
now she run global health policy for johnson johnson the medical equipment and pharmaceutical giant which strongly back the health bill and stand to benefit from it
ms. fowler be not a register lobbyist but she do provide in house advice on the bill work that have draw criticism from publication like the british newspaper the guardian and the web site salon and the huffington post where the journalist bill moyers single out ms. fowler assert that when push come to shove corporate interest will have the upper hand
yet the progression from government to the private sector be also predictable a window into the peculiar rhythm of life in the capital
young aide often fresh out of college or graduate school acquire highly specialized knowledge but eventually settle down build life and long for job that pay more and let them see their child at night
those be consideration for dr. hughes who have a 3-year old and yvette fontenot a mother of three who begin her washington career in 1997 analyze medicare for the office of management and budget
ms. fontenot work on the health bill as a finance committee aide and later move to the white house
four month ago she join avenue solutions a boutique lobby shop
every client out there be interested in the affordable care act and what it mean say ms. fontenot who like dr. hughes concentrate on strategic advice
with exchange soon to go live she say company want to know whether there be a potential to build on this to make change
many of the former health care official be lawyer or lobbyist though not all

phoenix the inspector who set out last year to review the use of force policy employ by the roughly 40,000 federal agent guard the nation 's border face a significant obstacle from the get go
neither of two separate system to track complaint of misconduct offer a clear way to link a specific accusation to the use of excessive force
the system one operate by the office of the inspector general and the other run jointly by customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement all of them arm of the department of homeland security use different designation to categorize the complaint make it impossible for the inspector to determine the total number of excessive force accusation and investigation against agent accord to a redact version of their report release tuesday
although the discrepancy in the system have be know at least since the inspector finish their work in april customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement have yet to add use of force as an option to categorize complaint the report say
to civil right group the shortcoming underline one of the problem of have a fragmented mechanism to track misconduct that be partly under the authority of the agent employer
at the heart of this report be a question about independence say chris rickerd policy counsel at the american civil liberties union one of the group that have press for the review
since january 2010 agent have kill at least 15 people include a 16-year old along the border with mexico sometimes during confrontation set off by rock throwing and other assault other time under less clear circumstance
the report do not answer whether the agent be wrong in fire their weapon frustrate the 16 member of congress who demand the review after a pbs documentary last year raise question about the action of customs and border protection agent in san diego in 2010 when a man in their custody die after be stun several time by a taser
use the abbreviation by which the agency be know representative lucille roybal allard democrat of california say i once again call on c.b.p. to examine the best practice of the nation 's top police force and take meaningful action to avert future case of abuse and death at the hand of the federal border enforcement personnel
the report 's scope be limit to the effect the surge in the number of agent in the past six year have have on training and performance and whether reform adopt by the agency could help avoid deadly encounter
the change include audit of whether use of force policy learn in the academy be understand and correctly apply in the field
over all the inspector review 21,000 record from 2007 to 2012 which yield more than 2,000 allegation of abuse excessive force or intentional discharge of a weapon
about 500 complaint could not be categorize because the record lack enough information
the finding be mixed
between 2006 and 2009 when the border patrol grow by almost 65 percent financing for use of force training quadruple
despite this and other budgetary increase customs and border protection have yet to build a mock border fence in one of its training center to simulate the kind of situation the agent be likely to face the report find
several official interview by the inspector say that although border agent know the necessary tool and tactic of the job when they leave basic training they be not fully prepare for some real life situation like the stress and fear they may face when rock rain on them from the mexican side of the fence
during an internal review customs and border protection 's use of force division find that new border agent and custom officer be not train on all of the less lethal weapon available to them like pepper spray and tasers or sufficiently train on high risk situation like rock assault
in one instance an internal audit find that new agent simply do not understand the use of force policy when they enter the field
custom and border protection official say it be a single episode out of 32 audit perform
in their response enclose in the report the official acknowledge the importance of have a mock border fence area
they note that while the agency have the building material it do not yet have money for construction though they be work to incorporate at least one simulator in the current fiscal year which end sept. 30
we should continue to expand the use of scenario base training and continue to pursue new technology to ensure field agent have the right skill the response read

elberton ga. for more than 30 year the hulk granite slab inscribe with teaching in eight language have raise profound and vexing issue why be they here
what do they mean
what do they say about life after doomsday
but confront with a deep and sustained economic slowdown resident here in the profess granite capital of the world be now ponder something a bit more mundane be there a way to turn a mysterious 237,746-pound monument know as the georgia guidestones into a moneymaker
only one man be say to know the identity of the benefactor who go by the name of r. c. christian when he visit this east georgia city in 1979 and pay for the display supposedly on behalf of a group of others live outside georgia
i make an oath to that man and i can not break that say wyatt martin 82 the retire banker who help broker the arrangement for the monument which be 19 foot tall and resemble stonehenge
no one will ever know
but nearly everyone here have a theory about the artifact build during the cold war and say to be at least in part a guide for civilization 's future in the aftermath of a nuclear attack
its edict include a call to unite humanity with a live new language and a recommendation to keep the planet 's population below 500 million
the census bureau estimate the world 's population be 7.1 billion
to some it ' the holy spot on earth say hudson cone who have track the history of the guidestones since he work for the elberton granite association a trade group that some believe order the construction to draw attention to the city 's mainstay industry

to others it ' a monument to the devil
take your pick
but if one man here get his way that last debate could become a spigot of cash for a county of nearly 20,000 people where unemployment approach 12 percent and the median household income stand below $ 33,000
my long term goal be to build some sort of festival around it something that would be a weeklong thing that could be hold in two or three different spot around elberton that could really draw in crowd and help the local economy say mart clamp a local businessman who help his father engrave the guidestones
there ' a big push right now for the wholesomeness of how small town operate
people be draw to that
mr. clamp who have long volunteer to maintain the oft deface structure urge county official this month to lease him the land where the guidestones stand so he can mount a campaign to attract more visitor to this area near the south carolina border
there be daunting legal obstacle to mr. clamp 's proposal
for starter the property 's deed bar anyone from charge admission to the guidestones and ban permanent building on the small county own site
but there be also early interest partly because the guidestones have long attract visitor despite the absence of an aggressive campaign to tempt tourist and elberton 's significant distance from any interstate
it be the most visit thing that we have in elbert county say tommy lyon the chairman of the county commission
we get people come so i assume that with the right kind of marketing it could grow
but even if the guidestones have prove tantalizing to outsider include many from abroad there be still close to home skeptic like sandy beggs an elberton native who have never be to the site
i just have no desire ms. beggs say during her shift at her family 's christian bookstore
i 've just always hear bad thing
others in the city cite anecdote about episode of witchcraft as their reason for keep their distance from guidestones road
there be widespread curiosity about the donor reportedly a tall dapper man with a midwestern accent who say he devise his pseudonym from his christian faith
and there be also a consensus that the secrecy surround the monument have add to its allure
whoever come up with this whatever the reason whether it be r. c. christian or whoever they do a heck of a job say mike reser a south carolina filmmaker who direct a recent documentary about the site
if they come out and say r. c. christian be definitely so and so i do not think anyone would visit the monument
even if it come out to be someone kind of sensational it would cause a stir at that time and then it would die out and i do not think the stone would be visit often

to appeal to the person who want to romanticize farming and the person who be knee deep in turkey droppings be hard and i think they 're balance that she say
it help that modern farmer explore a subject on the mind of some of the world 's wealthy people
ann marie gardner the founder and editor in chief conceive the idea for a magazine in 2011 after she notice that source she interview for monocle magazine seem preoccupied by agricultural issue

he write about the work his foundation have be do with farmer globally like help fisherman along colombia 's coast get their fish into restaurant
mr. clinton also offer his own recollection of help his uncle buddy tend his farm plot in arkansas
as a young boy i pick bean corn and tomato pour tub of water into sandy soil to grow large watermelon feed animal and badly lose a head butt contest to a ram write mr. clinton

scott mortimer publisher and general manager at meredith corporation which include successful farming note that grain price be rise land price be at historical high and the technology to produce crop have improve
ms. gardner may find that some of her big critic be not battle harden medium type but farmer
allan van tassel an 83-year old lifelong farmer who be ms. gardner 's neighbor tell her regularly that the magazine do not have a chance of survival
it ' a nice idea mr. van tassel say
but as i say you drive up and down the road and you see these small conglomerate where they 're go to raise thing one year two year
then they 're go
ms. gardner do not discredit the peril of either publish or farming
while modern farmer slowly and steadily progress last year a windstorm wipe out her entire crop of pear
this year as she have log long hour make modern farmer grow her own garden have become overgrown
eventually she place her trust in a professional
i bring in a farmer to help me ms. gardner say

suzy menkes talk recently with jonathan saunders one of the rise young designer in london and winner of the emerging talent award for man 's wear in the 2012 british fashion awards
q. jonathan saunders you have win an award as a breakthrough man 's wear designer mean that after just two year of do man 's wear you be top of the pile
how do you feel
a.
well i feel privileged
i think that the wonderful thing about man 's wear be that i love do it
you know it ' a joy
woman 's wear be something that be my passion and i have do it since i graduate college
but something that remind me of when i be a furniture designer remind me of man 's wear
it be very product lead
it ' very much about the clothing as individual piece and you work in a different way when you 're work on man 's
it allow me to do something that i really miss and that ' why i love it so much
q.
so as a young scottish boy what be the trajectory that bring you to this award to design for both man and woman
a.
well you know i be not a kid that be bring up draw dress and aspire to be a fashion designer
i go to glasgow school of art
i study furniture design
i love work with marquetry and paneling of wood and color and all those different thing just make thing
and that ' how i start
and it start off as woman 's wear but because of that i think it ' quite a natural progression into man 's you know
it ' a pragmatic approach to design as oppose to the fantastical way we fantasize about woman 's wear
and although it ' similar and it ' passionate and it ' a joy to work on it ' very much a more simplistic way of work
i think that it ' for me personally a relief if that make sense
q. i think of your work as very linear very graphic and a lot of pattern when you be work with alexander mcqueen
so where do that come from
do you as a child see a lot of pattern and print
be that the start of it
a.
yeah i be always interested in fine art
i always want to be an artist
and i be not say that what i do now be anywhere remotely near that
but i love the bauhaus i love the idea of that movement where people get together and they think about thing in a new way and they try new technique and they be very process lead
and that be what i be always inspire by
i do not think of myself as an artist
i want to make thing but i do not really know in which medium to do it
so i kind of try and test different way of do it
when i go to saint martins i meet louise wilson
so my folio be a bunch of album cover copy and paste and stick together with sellotape of david bowie and color of pink floyd and a montage of all different idea
but it be not anything real
and she just let me do what i want to do and she believe in me and say o.k. so if you want to be a fashion designer do it in your own way and try it out
that for me be the starting point
i think because of that it ' quite easy to translate into woman 's wear or man 's wear or interior or whatever it be as a creative project i just love make stuff basically
q. you have some fantastic support not least from samantha cameron the wife of the british prime minister and she not only wear your dress but she give a tipoff to michelle obama
a.
that ' kind of wonderful be not it
i think from a scotsman from a council estate in glasgow it ' pretty good go
i think what ' wonderful about samantha be that she love britain and she love the creative industry in britain and she ' happy to promote it and i think that that be what we 're all about these day
whether it ' london men 's or london fashion week all of us be try to make ourselves not only innovator in term of idea but business
and something to come and see from a business perspective
i think what samantha do and what michelle have do be really help support all of us which be brilliant
q.
but tell us how it happen
so do samantha cameron just take a dress over and put it in front of michelle obama and say you 've get to look at this guy
he ' brilliant
a.
well michelle i think buy her own clothes
she go to a shop in chicago call ikram and she buy thing that she love
and that ' what i love about any kind of person that be wear your clothes
you know if somebody have pick it out themselves and somebody appreciate it whether it ' everybody 's taste it do not matter
and that ' what i saw happen with michelle and i think that ' what happen with samantha
and i think that you know print and color be something that be what i love and if it suit somebody for a tuesday evening then that ' perfect
q. kate middleton be somebody else that have wear your clothes
do you feel an affinity with these people
do you actually relate to them or do you just see them wear your clothes
a. i appreciate anybody make the choice to wear something that i have design
i always feel like when i start that i be kind of learn as i go
in london what ' wonderful about it be that you start from college you do it from your bedroom and all of a sudden you 're on the internet and people know what you 're do
and to be quite frank you do not really know what you 're do and you kind of wing it for a couple of year and you try to pretend that you know what you 're do and you learn it as you go
i think that what ' wonderful about london be that it support designer like that to be able to do that
in no other city in the world could you do it from nothing
you know you get â£500 from the bank you do a collection and you get support from fashion east or the british fashion council or whatever it be
and we all manage to do our own collection and start that way
i think we learn how to be designer in a very different way from the rest of the world
i think that be something to be celebrate about
i think that those people that wear it be advocator for that
q.
when it come to design man 's wear be it a very different process for you
it seem to me now that man 's wear be very hot that a lot of people be much more interested than they be
it ' become almost as universal for man to look for new fashion as it be for woman to do so
a. man 's wear be a very exciting business to be involve in
i think that guy want to look different
they do not want to look generic which be a changed thing
because previously i know grow up in glasgow if you look anything from the norm you be in trouble
i think that guy be pragmatic and they 're practical and they look at the detail on a cuff and they look at the detail in the inside of something they feel how comfortable it be
they do not want to go through torture wear something for the evening and they 're very conscious of it
i be as a person let alone designer
you know when a guy really do not put up with much that teach you about be a good designer it teach you about how to work with fabric and how to make something work for a person and you know it ' be inspire for me to learn about it
lelystad netherlands on an open plain in front of us be hundred of horse
most of them be gray with black mane and tail
their head look more like those of their wild cousin zebra than those of rid horse
some even show what may be a vestigial stripe on their flank
we could be in the serengeti say hans breeveld my guide refer to the plain in tanzania that be a haven to wildlife
well we almost could
to the north we encounter another big group of large animal this time red deer do with their young
they gaze at us and bleat like sheep
off in the distance be massive cattle with impose horizontal horn that look like they may have walk out of a cave painting
every now and then a brown harrier a large and rare raptor float by and we glimpse a white tail eagle another specie unusual in most of europe perch on a dead tree
rather than africa we be in the netherlands one of the most densely populate country in europe at a place call the oostvaardersplassen
this stretch of swamp and grassland of more than 6,000 hectare or about 15,000 acre be just a 45-minute train ride from amsterdam
and it be the site of a remarkable and controversial experiment that have be the subject of intense national debate and have grab the attention of expert in international wildlife management and animal welfare
this wild area start as low lie polder land that be reclaim from the sea in the late 1960
mr. breeveld who have work as a ranger in the oostvaardersplassen for about 30 year explain that the idea be to put light industry here but the recession hit and investor do not come
in the meantime a small group of scientist and bird watcher notice that the marshy area be attract specie like egret that have become rare or have vanish from the netherlands
something special be transpiring
this give a window into what large part of the netherlands look like in the past say frans vera an ecologist who have be an advocate for the reserve
mr. vera and his allies push for an unusual form of management which as much as possible allow nature to take its course
a bold and persuasive thinker mr. vera argue that the grassy area should be crop not by domestic sheep and cattle but by beast resemble their wild ancestor
as these specie be extinct he settle on konik horse polish descendant of the tarpan and heck cattle which have be breed in germany in an attempt to recreate the aurochs
small group of these animal as well as red deer be introduce in the 1980 and 1990
by three year ago their number have soar to a total of about 4,000 with deer by far the most numerous
in the last couple of year there have be a decline with about 2,700 animal count in april before the breeding season
as in the serengeti or any other natural ecosytem a large proportion of the animal die each year
but the death at oostvaardersplassen mostly because of starvation when food run out in the winter have turn out to be enormously controversial in the netherlands
the preserve become a subject of intense political debate in the news medium and government in the harsh winter earlier this century
while access to theâ oostvaardersplassen be restrict train run frequently along the perimeter of the area give passenger a view of dead animal or whatever else be transpire
a lot of people be visually confront with die animal in the winter say frauke ohl a professor of animal welfare at utrecht university
it be an unusual thing that people can see these thing happen
critic include animal welfare advocate and hunt group argue that to allow animal that be fence in albeit in a large enclosure to starve be cruel and immoral and that the number need to be proactively reduce
hundred of horse cattle and deer die each year from famine say maarten frankenhuis a veterinarian and a former director of the artis zoo in amsterdam
this project be our national shame

let it be know that the tough drake era begin not this week with the release of nothing be the same the first official tough drake album but rather begin all the way back on jan. 6 2012
that day saw the release of the video for stay schemin a rick ross song feature drake and french montana
the clip be a fuzzy michael mann rip off nighttime miami reduce to black gray and electric blue ooze sinister energy
in it drake don a black sweatshirt black jean black boot and a gold chain
he spend most of his verse star hard into the camera his eyebrow barely move
he gesture brusquely with a bandanna in his right hand
and he deliver what be easily the most tart harsh menacing verse of his career may look light but we heavy though
this come not even two month after the release of take care drake 's masterpiece album of sensitivity and recrimination and it read like an almost total repudiation of it
that album be a bloodletting of heartbreak and anxiety while stay schemin be a firm punch to the jaw that become a staple at the same time as some purple song from take care
not only be drake write his own narrative he be also write his own counternarrative
it ' difficult to tell which of those be now the main plot both be in play on nothing be the same young money/cash money/republic drake 's third excellent major label album and the first to come as he be firmly ensconce in hip hop 's top tier
before he be an interloper effect seismic change in hip hop thanks to his dismantling of the usual facade of acquisitiveness and fearlessness
build on kanye west 's template of ambivalence drake take mr. west 's self examination and strip it of all its agitation preserve only the emotional turmoil
he want success and be aware of his more conventional competition but his concern be primarily internal
but drake be on top now the genre 's stylistic standard bearer and its most reliable and versatile hit maker and his concern have shift accordingly
on nothing be the same drake brood like before sure but also puff his chest in equal measure
he ' always use his music to send message to woman who have break his heart or whom he just could not hold tight enough
now he ' get something to lord over them too
the musical choice be familiar hazy often doleful post soul and low end heavy hip hop largely move slowly and with deliberateness
most of the album be produce by drake 's longtime associate 40 who ' stick close to the sound that ' become their joint signature
the ache hit hold on we 're go home recall find your love from 2010 pound cake be reminiscent of dreams money can buy from 2011
the most noticeable change in drake over the last couple of year have be physical not musical suddenly he ' muscle full of hard angle
the eye remain soft but everything around them have be remake
this be the externalization of the bravado that be now an essential part of his music he ' brag plenty before but now it have weight
it ' probably worth mention the new york nightclub altercation between drake 's crew and chris brown 's crew in june 2012 when drake speak of it in a recent gq interview he have an ominous air as if anticipate how thing could get bad
but muscle aside there ' no real physicality to drake 's toughness
it ' a psychological evolution more than anything the result of accept his stature as reality not just a dream
in the past lay himself bare have be the most natural thing
but when you 're the object of ire and jealousy the apt response be to flash teeth and snarl a bit
the
nothing be the same tough talk begin several month ago with the release of start
from the bottom like most of drake 's opening album single it ' far more muscular than what appear on the rest of the album
it ' rousing and victorious there be not really much out here that ' pop off without us and also a bit malevolent
that be one of several song date back to stay schemin
in which drake put up his duke and prepare for a fight the baleful 5am in toronto or his verse on the remix to versace by migos this year i be eat your food and my table get so many plate on it or the joyful flexing on asap rocky 's single the unprintable title of which shorten to problem

tired of be thrust onto the front line of the nation 's debate over gun starbucks be ask customer to leave firearm behind when they be in its store and its outdoor seating area
the policy change come after a shooting rampage at the washington navy yard on monday that leave 13 people include the gunman dead
but starbucks say its decision be not in response to that or to the shooting spree that kill 26 child and adult at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown conn. just day before christmas last year
i 've spend a significant amount of personal time on this issue in the last several month and i have see the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it be on both side howard schultz the chief executive of starbucks say in a telephone interview
nevertheless customer in many store have be jar and fairly uncomfortable to see gun in our store not understand the issue and feel that gun should not be part of the starbucks experience especially when small kid be around
under the change baristas and other store employee will not ask customer who come in with gun in holster say to leave or confront them in any way mr. schultz say
no sign explain the policy will be post in starbucks store either
we be go to serve them as we would serve anyone else he say
there be go to be people on both side who will be disappoint or angry but we 're make a decision we think be in the best interest of our customer employee and the company
he say store official would evaluate compliance over time and consider post sign if necessary
a majority of company own starbucks store be in state that allow people to openly carry gun although restriction and limitation vary from state to state
the company have have a handful of armed robbery in its store over the year as well as two recent incident where gun carry in woman 's purse have discharge accidentally but little other gun violence in its store
under its previous policy however starbucks have be unwillingly co opt by proponent of open carry policy and vilify by those seek strict law on gun ownership
garry trudeau devote six consecutive day of his doonesbury comic strip in 2010 to mock the company 's stance which open with a barista greet a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and say welcome to starbucks sir
would you be openly carry a weapon today
pro gun activist have use our store as a political stage for medium event misleadingly call starbucks appreciation day that disingenuously portray starbucks as a champion of open carry mr. schultz write in an open letter to be publish in ad in major newspaper
last month starbucks close a store in newtown early after gun right supporter wear camouflage and connecticut citizens defense league t shirt hold one of their event there
similarly opponent of military style assault weapon in store like the group moms demand action for gun sense in america which advocate skip starbucks sundays have stag protest outside starbucks store and urge consumer to boycott the company
in 2010 the brady campaign to prevent gun violence team with credo action an activist group that use mobile technology and social medium to push change and attract more than 40,000 signature on a petition aim at change the company 's policy on gun in its store that be deliver to starbucks headquarters in seattle
it sound like howard schultz be make a very good business decision say brian malte director of legislation and mobilization at the brady campaign

lot of family with child college student and young people be starbucks customer and they want to feel safe
the company have long follow local law regard the ability to carry gun in plain sight
customer in the 44 state that allow legal gun owner to carry weapon openly have be permit in its store there while those in the six other state new york california south carolina illinois florida and texas have not accord to the law center to prevent gun violence
i want to make it very clear that starbucks be not a policy maker and as a company we be not pro- or anti gun mr. schultz say
however there have be a number of episode over the course of the last few month that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open carry
most other restaurant chain and retailer follow policy similar to the one starbucks be abandon although peet 's coffee and tea and california pizza kitchen ban gun from their store altogether
disney also forbid gun in its theme park and costco do not allow its member to carry them openly in its store
while peet 's coffee and tea respect and value all individual right under the law like many other private retail establishment our policy be not to allow customer carry firearm in our store or on our outdoor seating premise unless they be uniformed or identified law enforcement officer the company say in a statement forward by a spokeswoman
a spokeswoman for the national restaurant association say the organization do not have a list of its member policy on gun but note that some state that have open carry law on the book still prohibit public display of firearm in restaurant
washington president obama 's first two defense secretary publicly question the administration 's handling of the syrian crisis on tuesday night and express skepticism about whether russia can broker a deal to remove syria 's chemical weapon
in a joint appearance in dallas both former pentagon chief robert m. gates and leon e. panetta be critical of mr. obama for ask congress to authorize the use of force against syria in retaliation over its use of chemical weapon
but they disagree on whether military action would be an effective response
mr. gates say mr. obama 's proposed military strike be a mistake while mr. panetta say it be a mistake not to carry out an attack
my bottom line be that i believe that to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple day to underscore or validate a point or a principle be not a strategy mr. gates say during a forum at southern methodist university
if we launch a military attack in the eye of a lot of people we become the villain instead of assad he add refer to president bashar al assad of syria
mr. gates the only cabinet member from the administration of george w. bush whom mr. obama ask to stay say missile strike on syria would be throw gasoline on a very complex fire in the middle east

have n't iraq afghanistan and libya teach us something about the unintended consequence of military action once it ' launch
mr. gates say
mr. panetta also speak at the forum say the president should have keep his word after he have pledge action if syria use chemical weapon
when the president of the united states draw a red line the credibility of this country be dependent on him back up his word mr. panetta say
once the president come to that conclusion then he should have direct limited action go after assad to make very clear to the world that when we draw a line and we give our word then we back it up mr. panetta say
mr. gates and mr. panetta make their most extensive comment on current national security policy and certainly their most critical statement on policy of the administration they both serve since leave public service
both former secretary have announce plan to publish memoir expect to shine more light on the internal policy debate of their tenure
neither express a specific reason for break their silence on the obama administration 's decisionsâ tuesdayâ night
ask about the comment at a news conference on wednesday the current defense secretary chuck hagel say he have the great respect for his two predecessor but add obviously i do not agree with their perspective
another former high rank obama administration official michael j. morell who recently retire as the deputy director of the c.i.a. also express skepticism about the negotiation broker by russia
i think this be the syrians play for time mr. morell tell foreign policy magazine in an interview publish tuesday on its web site
i do not believe that they would seriously consider give up their chemical weapon
mr. gates say he doubt whether president vladimir v. putin of russia be sincere in his effort to broker a deal and say he be skeptical that the syrian government would disarm
he say it be absurd that syria need day or week to identify the location and size of its chemical weapon arsenal and he suggest that the timetable should be an ultimatum of 48 hour
when ask whether the west should trust mr. putin mr. gates say be you kid me
he advocate identify credible partner within the syrian opposition and increase support include weapon but not surface to air missile which could be seize by militant for terrorist act against civilian aviation
he also support a strategy of sanction that label member of the assad government as war criminal with the threat of arrest if they leave syria and suggest sanction on assad family member live or study overseas include on their financial holding
such pressure may prompt some in the inner circle to negotiate an end to the civil war mr. gates say
although mr. gates say that any unilateral military action against syria would be a mistake he also say it be unwise for the president to have seek congressional authorization to use force because of the risk to presidential prestige if he be rebuff
if congress vote no it would weaken him mr. gates say
it would weaken our country
it would weaken us in the eye of our allies as well as our adversary around the world
under question from the moderator david gergen who advise four president and be now on the faculty at the kennedy school of government at harvard both former secretary say that american credibility on syria be essential to endure effort to prevent iran from build nuclear weapon
iran be pay very close attention to what we 're do mr. panetta say
there ' no question in my mind they 're look at the situation and what they be see right now be an element of weakness
mr. panetta say that the president have to retain the responsibility and the authority on this issue and that it be wrong to subcontract the decision to congress
mr. president this congress have a hard time agree as to what the time of day be he say

new york city opera open its season on tuesday night at the brooklyn academy of music with the eagerly anticipate american premiere of the brilliant british composer mark anthony turnage 's anna nicole
yes that anna nicole
this audacious entertaining and in its strange way wrench opera tell of the real life playboy playmate reality television star and fortune hunter anna nicole smith
yet hover over this exhilarating coproduction with the brooklyn academy be the sad realization that anna nicole could also be the only production of city opera 's current season or even possibly the final offering in the history of this value 70-year old company
george steel city opera 's general manager and artistic director recently announce that though all seven performance of anna nicole would take place the company would not be able to present three other schedule production this season unless it could raise $ 7 million by the end of this month
he add that the company need another $ 13 million by year 's end to proceed with plan for 2014 15
if the rest of this season and all of the next be cancel it be hard to imagine how the people 's opera could ever re emerge
many longtime supporter of the company be distress by the programming cutback in recent year and by mr. steel 's decision to abandon lincoln center and instead present production in various manhattan and brooklyn locale which he assert be more affordable
several production mr. steel present during his two season at lincoln center 's renovate david h. koch theater and two nomadic season be innovative and exciting
but it have be hard for him to project a vision for city opera when the company have no home and the offering be so few
anna nicole show what we will be miss if city opera fold
the work be commission by the royal opera in london and have its premiere at covent garden in february 2011
i attend that premiere fear the bad
i think that mr. turnage his librettist richard thomas best know for writing and composing
jerry springer the opera and the director richard jones would just make fun of smith
i be wrong
the three creator all british certainly have fun depict smith 's tawdry american life and skewer reality television
but their anna emerge as an improbable operatic heroine a restless woman yearn to escape her backwater birthplace mexia tex a striver determine to get ahead and raise a son in any way possible
be not this the american dream
the royal opera production with brash neon lighted set by miriam buether and colorful garish costume by nicky gillibrand look great on the stage at the brooklyn academy
in this swiftly pace two act opera anna 's story be tell in flashback frame by a series of television interview
it begin with a gaggle of reporter who like a greek chorus come to tabloid journalism fill us in on the background story
mr. thomas 's word bop along often in loosely rhymed couplet
the language be clever and crass and mr. turnage set the chorus 's word in sputter burst of block chord
anna the appealing soprano sarah joy miller first appear her blond lock flow sit in a golden chair amid the reporter
ms. miller 's voice sometimes seem light for anna 's intense outburst and her top note be occasionally tight
but she easily dispatch the coloratura filigree of the vocal writing and bring sensual warmth and yearn to her win performance
you feel for this anna when she sing of her oppressive childhood with a brutish father the burly voice james barbour a foul mouthed mother the indomitable mezzo soprano susan bickley who make young anna swipe toilet roll from fast food joint and sundry relative include a female cousin who have five kid and no teeth
anna nicole have prompt much talk in the opera world for the raunchiness of its libretto and the scene of sex and drug
yet every time the piece threaten to slip into smutty humor the creator especially mr. turnage tap the depth and sadness of anna 's story
a brainy modernist but also a lifelong jazz fan mr. turnage have write a score that bristle with jazzy energy touch of sardonic cabaret and stretch of bittersweet waltz
the music 's harmonic complexity and textural richness humanize anna and reach tragic realm in the final scene
the conductor steven sloane draw pulsing feisty and textured playing from the orchestra
the overall performance be mar though by what sound like occasional feedback and crackle from an amplification system that seem to include microphone on individual singer
when anna have marry billy a guy she meet work at a fry chicken place and give birth to a boy head to houston the city of joy as she imagine she wind up work in a walmart in a pathetically funny scene
she then take a job in a gentleman 's club where a veteran dancer teach her the crucial difference between strip and lap dancing which be what they do
yet anna be not entice the moneyed clientele because as she come to realize her breast be too small
hence during a dizzying scene anna nicole offer what have to be the first depiction in opera history of silicone implant surgery
the procedure do the trick
anna attract a twice divorce oil billionaire j. howard marshall ii who be 89 when he marry the 26-year old divorce smith
the dynamic tenor robert brubaker have great fun in the role of the nasal tone dilapidated still randy eccentric
the billionaire give anna everything except the ranch she would like to live on with her boy daniel
to win over marshall ms. miller 's anna her back to the audience perform oral sex on him surround by a crowd of stunned reporter
afterward in another moment of poignant quizzical music that take you by surprise anna tell little daniel we get the ranch
act ii open after the wedding of anna and marshall and in a surreal staging touch we see the couple wake up on a humongous mattress watch by the first of what will be many prying demon dancer in black tights with television camera for head
the opera closely follow the tragic final decade of smith 's life
she die in 2007 at 39
marshall die his child from an earlier marriage go to court to keep anna from inherit anything she gain weight and grow reliant on the creepy howard k. stern who be her lawyer manager adviser and lover here the baritone rod gilfry who convey the character 's swagger and scheme
in the last scene daniel be now a drug addled teenager nicholas barasch who bring his mother pill and pillow to cushion the constant pain in her low back a result of the implant
daniel die while visit his mother from a fatal combination of pill
the only line daniel sing in elusive hazy music come after his death when he lift his head from a body bag and go through the litany of the drug he have take
soon from another body bag the devastate pill pop anna sing the opera 's hush final line
mr. steel and the academy show courage in bring anna nicole to new york
even while try to find a way out of a grim financial crisis new york city opera be again present a production that should not be miss
anna nicole continue through sept. 28 at the brooklyn academy of music 30 lafayette avenue at ashland place fort greene 718 636 4100 nycopera.com

this be not a case of nimby the neighbor in sunnyside gardens queens say
it ' more a matter of namby
no aluminum in my backyard
some resident be upset about a plan to build a two story eight unit apartment house at 39th avenue and 50th street in the sunnyside gardens historic district
what have galvanize opposition be a gesture that be suppose to make the project palatable
in the crook of the l shape apartment house the architect frances campani and michael schwarting would reconstruct the vestige of the groundbreaking prefabricate all aluminum aluminaire house of 1931
how can a house that in some way resemble a spaceship be plop down in the middle of this neighborhood ask city councilman jimmy van bramer who represent sunnyside gardens
the proposal be schedule to go before the landmarks preservation commission on tuesday
the aluminaire house be first exhibit in the grand central palace hall which once stand near grand central terminal as a life size example of how industrial material could be use to build attractive affordable home
one architect interview by the new york times say the light rectilinear effect of this house suggest the simple elegance of line of japanese house
the eminent architect wallace k. harrison buy the house 22 foot and 6 inch by 28 foot and 8 inch and move it to huntington n.y. where he alter and expand it
six year after mr. harrison 's death in 1981 a new owner plan to demolish the house
paul goldberger then the architecture critic of the times sound an alarm on march 8 1987 say that nothing less be at stake than one of the pivotal work of modern architecture in america
in the end the new owner of the house donate it to the new york institute of technology
mr. schwarting a professor of architecture at the institute enlist his student to help document and disassemble the building in 1988
the structure be later rebuild at the school 's central islip campus
last year however no longer be use for academic program and under attack by vandal the house be take down
it be now in storage
the institute have give the building to the nonprofit aluminaire house foundation found by ms. campani and mr. schwarting wife and husband who be partner in campani schwarting architects of port jefferson n.y.
their search for a new home for the aluminaire house bring them to harry otterman
in 2007 mr. otterman buy a lot at 39th avenue and 50th street that originally be a playground for youngster who live in phipps garden apartments across the avenue
the playground be design by marjorie sewell cautley and still have feature like a sandbox pavilion and a wad pool basin even though it have be close for many year
mr. otterman seek to develop the site with new housing
because the lot be in a historic district his plan must first be approve by the landmark commission
add the aluminaire house to the site be mean as an enticement to the commissioner
mr. schwarting acknowledge the difference between a metal clothe house and the understated redbrick garden apartment and row house of the district
but he see the aluminaire house as complementary to sunnyside gardens
he say its architect albert frey and lawrence kocher have a lot in common with clarence stein and henry wright who create sunnyside gardens in the 1920s
no matter how different the result they all care about find way to build welcome innovative and economical housing for work people
we feel pretty sure that once it ' there because it ' an intimate little piece that it will function in the neighborhood as a landmark mr. schwarting say
the foundation would run the house as a museum
most neighbor seem unwilling to give the plan a chance
they object to the incongruity of the aluminaire house the design of the new apartment building which would be clothe in terra cotta panel and the loss of an open corner lot
there be even a movement afoot quixotic though it may be to acquire the property and transform it into a public space call cautley garden
herbert reynolds of the sunnyside gardens preservation alliance frame the issue in term of conservation
we 're try to respect the plan community that clarence stein and his colleague entrust to us he say and
consistent mod handsome architecture plus liberal open space with toddler playground be very much part of that visionary plan
the head of two influential preservation group the historic districts council and the new york landmarks conservancy say they do not support the aluminaire house plan
still almost everyone hop it will have another life
the aluminaire house be architecturally significant councilman van bramer say
it should be restore and put on display for people to learn about enjoy and experience
however that should be do somewhere else

washington after three year of cajoling finessing and occasionally strong arm his fitful conservative majority speaker john a. boehner wave the white flag on wednesday surrender to demand from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after sept. 30 to strip president obama 's health care law of any financing
mr. boehner know that the plan he unveil can not pass the senate and that it may prove unwise politically and economically
his leadership team press just last week for an alternative
but with conservative force unite against him he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate and few good option to stop a government shutdown in two week
today be a step forward and a win for the american people say representative tom graves the georgia republican whose defund obamacare push have amass 80 house supporter a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome
with much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month and run out of borrow authority by mid october mr. boehner face a choice he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with republican and democratic vote or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the affordable care act of financing unite his republican majority around that war cry and hope for the best
house conservative let mr. boehner know that any solution that could not attract a majority of the republican conference could cost him his speakership
divided senate republicans make clear that link further government spending or a debt ceiling increase to gutting the health care law would never get through the senate
in march the speaker himself say do you want to risk the full faith and credit of the u.s. government over obamacare
that ' a very tough argument to make
on wednesday the speaker announce his choice
the law ' a train wreck he say
it ' time to protect american family from this unworkable law
the house 's stopgap spending measure would finance the government through dec. 15 at the current spending level which reflect the automatic spending cut that take effect in march know as sequestration while block the health care law under which the uninsured will be enrol begin on oct. 1
if the bill clear the house on friday republican leader could put forward a measure as soon as next week that would raise the government 's statutory borrowing limit
that bill would also take aim at the affordable care act with a one year delay of its provision couple with a one year increase in the debt ceiling
it would also expedite the construction of the keystone xl oil pipeline from canada to louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code and possibly include some other republican wish like specific spending cut and regulatory change
for mr. boehner the announcement wednesday be a humbling moment and possibly a define one
since the tea party wave sweep republicans to power in 2010 the beleaguered speaker have often find himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference
in late 2011 he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explain via telephone how it have to give up its opposition to extend a cut in the payroll tax
three time this year on major piece of legislation the speaker have put what he believe to be the great need of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right wing
in january the house pass legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increase on virtually every american but let tax rise on the wealthy with democratic vote and a minority of vote by republicans
the same math pass relief for hurricane sandy and a reauthorization of the violence against women act
this time around he be contrite quote a plaque that grace the speaker 's office of newt gingrich listen learn help and lead
the key to any leadership job be to listen mr. boehner say 1 2 next page

the president of sudan want for year by the international criminal court on charge of genocide and other crime in the darfur conflict set off a grow storm of anger on wednesday with his plan to attend the united nations general assembly as human right advocate urge government to oppose the visit and the court 's judge ask the united states to arrest him if he dare to come
american official confirm on tuesday that the sudanese leader omar hassan al bashir have submit a visa request to attend the general assembly which run through the end of the month
as the host country the united states be oblige to grant visa to foreign head of state or representative who wish to attend the general assembly regardless of their reputation or any dispute the american government may have with them
visa have historically be grant to world leader who be widely despised or mistrust in the united states include fidel castro of cuba robert mugabe of zimbabwe mahmoud ahmadinejad of iran hugo chã¡vez of venezuela and nikita s. khrushchev of the soviet union
but mr. bashir 's case be different because he would be the first visitor to the united nations with a stand warrant for his arrest by the international criminal court at the hague
the court have accuse him of criminal responsibility for atrocity include genocide commit in the western darfur region of sudan where more than 200,000 people be kill and more than two million uproot by almost a decade of fighting between the government and rebel
american official include samantha power the new american ambassador to the united nations have denounce his plan to visit but it be unclear what they can do legally to block it
the united states be not a member of the international criminal court and be not bind by provision that require member to carry out arrest warrant on fugitive defendant
but the united states be a member of the security council which vote to refer prosecution for darfur atrocity to the international criminal court and the american government have support the court 's effort to hold mr. bashir and others to account
ms. power say monday that instead of come to the general assembly it would be more appropriate for him to present himself to the i.c.c. and travel to the hague
mr. bashir have make no secret of his contempt for the international criminal court and have come to personify the problem of impunity that the court have increasingly confront in prosecute case
but a visit by mr. bashir to the united nations which help to create that court would represent a new level of audacity
i 'm shocked by the fact that he ' even think about it say jordan paust a professor of international law at the law center of the university of houston
he really do seem to be thumb his nose at the u.n. and the obama administration
the sudanese government which as of wednesday have not receive a state department response to mr. bashir 's visa request castigate ms. power and other official who say he should not come
the president 's visit will be to the u.n. headquarters the foreign ministry say in a statement
the host nation the united states do not have the legal right to object to the participation of any official from a full member state in the international organization in u.n. activity
the ministry add the government of the united states be not qualified morally politically or legally to give advice on respect international humanitarian law and human right in light of its well know track record of commit war crime and genocide against entire population the last be its invasion of iraq in 2003
alarm at the prospect that the united states may have no choice but to grant mr. bashir a visa human rights watch issue an urgent call on wednesday for the security council to publicly oppose his attendance
if al bashir turn up at the u.n. general assembly it will be a brazen challenge to security council effort to promote justice for crime in darfur say elise keppler the associate director of the international justice program at human rights watch
the last thing the u.n. need be a visit by an i.c.c. fugitive
late wednesday the court 's judge also take the extraordinary step of ask the justice department to take mr. bashir into custody if he proceed with the visit on the legal theory that even country that be not member of the court can decide to cooperate with it
in a statement the judge say inform by the office of the prosecutor of omar al bashir 's potential travel to the united states of america they have invite the competent u.s. authorities to arrest omar al bashir and surrender him to the court in the event he enter their territory
in march 2009 judge at the international criminal court order mr. bashir 's arrest charge him with war crime and crime against humanity for play an essential role in the murder rape torture pillage and displacement of large number of civilian in darfur
in 2010 the court issue a second arrest warrant for mr. bashir this time on three count of genocide
while he have take some international trip since then mr. bashir have be force to skip other event abroad because of the charge
in july mr. bashir make a brief appearance at an african union summit meeting in nigeria but depart after human right group file a lawsuit call for his immediate detention on an international arrest warrant

in the most significant sign yet of a broad shift in the focus of alzheimer 's research from treat to prevent the disease the federal government announce on wednesday its large grant so far to test an alzheimer 's drug on healthy people at great risk for the most common form of the disease
the $ 33.2 million grant and several other prevention study award federal money in the last year follow year of unsuccessful trial of treatment on people who already have dementia
those failure have lead to the realization that these drug appear to be ineffective by the time memory and thinking problem have take hold
at the same time scientific advance have allow researcher to identify people at risk for alzheimer 's long before symptom emerge
with five million americans suffer from alzheimer 's and their rank project to surge as baby boomer age federal health official consider the disease such a priority that dr. francis s. collins director of the national institutes of health scrap money together when force budget cut slash the obama administration 's promise of $ 100 million in additional funding for alzheimer 's for 2013
dr. collins say he dip into the budget of the 27 n.i.h. agency to supply $ 40 million award wednesday for several alzheimer 's research project
another $ 5 million be provide by the national institute on aging
the bad thing we could do would be to just hunker down and hold off tackle very important problem dr. collins say add obviously this be high risk research but goodness the stake be so high that we feel we have to go forward even in the face of the most difficult budget environment that anyone can remember in the n.i.h.
the idea be to approach alzheimer 's with a strategy similar to that use for heart disease and other condition say laurie ryan program director for alzheimer 's disease clinical trial at the national institute on aging part of the n.i.h.
we 're go to look at people at risk just like we do with people who have high cholesterol and be at risk for cardiovascular disease she say
if we intervene now can we prevent or at least delay the disease
the $ 33.2 million grant part of the government 's national alzheimer 's plan will help finance a clinical trial to test a treatment on people 60 to 75 who have no symptom of the disease but do have two copy of a gene know to greatly increase the risk of get it as people age
the project lead by dr. eric m. reiman and dr. pierre n. tariot of the banner alzheimer 's institute in phoenix will test a drug or placebo on 650 adult in several location mostly in the united states
all of the participant will have two copy of the gene apoe4 have inherit it from both parent
study have find that more than half the people with two apoe4 gene will develop alzheimer 's compare with about one fourth of people with one copy and 10 percent of people with no copy
people with two copy also develop symptom earlier around age 68 year before most people with one copy and more than a decade before most people without the gene
people with two apoe4 gene make up only about 3 percent of the population but because they develop the conventional late onset form of alzheimer 's they be important to study
about 25 percent of people possess one copy of the gene
the banner project have not yet choose the drug to be test but it will be a treatment that attack amyloid a protein that accumulate in plaque in the brain of people with alzheimer 's
expect to begin in 2015 the project will ultimately cost more than $ 100 million most of which be expect to be finance by the pharmaceutical industry with some money from nonprofit source dr. reiman say
researcher will use sophisticated test to measure whether the drug help delay memory or cognitive decline over five year although dr. reiman say the test may be able to record some result in as little as two year
the study will also measure brain and neurological change over time
jamie tyrone 53 a retired nurse in ramona calif. say she feel traumatize when she learn while participate in a different research effort that she have two copy of apoe4
for the first time i feel hopeful she say
while too young to participate in the trial she recently form a nonprofit organization call beating alzheimer 's by embrace science babes which will soon have its inaugural fund raiser feature the celebrity helen reddy and marilu henner
she say the new trial mean so much to me because if this study have a positive outcome guess what i can be treat and i do not have to live in fear anymore
the new grant be the late of several grant for alzheimer 's prevention study
in 2012 the n.i.h. award $ 16 million to a project lead by the same researcher and dr. francisco lopera a colombian neurologist
the researcher will test an anti amyloid drug on member of a colombian family the large extend family in the world with a gene mutation that cause them to develop alzheimer 's early show cognitive impairment by around age 45
in that trial expect to start this year family member as young as 30 will receive the drug crenezumab manufacture by genentech which be finance the large portion of that $ 100 million trial
earlier this year the n.i.h. give a significant grant to a study that like the banner trial will focus on people at risk for common late onset alzheimer 's
lead by dr. reisa sperling who run the alzheimer 's program at brigham and women 's hospital in boston the trial will test the anti amyloid drug solanezumab on 1,000 people in various location who do not have symptom of alzheimer 's but do have amyloid plaque in their brain
the three year trial will receive about $ 7 million in federal money its first year and a possible total of $ 36 million
on wednesday the n.i.h. also award $ 1.5 million to a trial of three anti amyloid drug on people with rare gene mutation that lead to early onset alzheimer 's
the trial run by the dominantly inherited alzheimer network lead by dr. randall bateman of washington university in st. louis may receive a total of $ 6 million over four year
dr. ronald petersen director of the mayo clinic 's alzheimer 's center who be not involve in these prevention trial say the study complement each other and have the potential to answer question about the role of amyloid as a potential cause of alzheimer 's and whether attack it can prevent dementia
that do not mean we abandon people who need treatment dr. petersen say
but from a public health perspective if you want to prevent million of people from get the disease this be the way we have to go
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 18 2013a headline with an earlier version of this article misstate the form of alzheimer 's disease that the alzheimer 's prevention initiative will focus on
it be late onset alzheimer 's not early onset

when terry francona spend last season away from the dugout as an analyst for espn he expect to gain perspective on life
he need the break after eight season of exhilaration and exhaustion as manager of the boston red sox but his mind rarely stray from the only life he have know
i have no perspective francona say tuesday smile as he spit tobacco juice into a gatorade cup in the visit manager 's office
there be no place he would rather be than here manage the cleveland indians in a pennant race
he ' pretty simple as far as how he go about his day it ' baseball baseball baseball say the bullpen coach kevin cash a former catcher for francona 's red sox
whatever we 're do we 're talk about baseball
we can be play card or watch tv but the conversation be always on this team
by now cash know that when the coach and francona agree to leave for the field at 11:30 a.m. francona will text them a half hour early eager to get go
francona be always comfortable at the ballpark and usually bore away from it
yet as much as he love the game francona 's bitter exit from the red sox make him wary of take just any job
the team have fold down the stretch in 2011 undo largely by a toxic clubhouse and the breakdown of trust between the front office and the manager
he be sure it would not be like that in cleveland
francona have work there in 2001 as a special assistant in baseball operation
he know the team president mark shapiro and the general manager chris antonetti
in time perhaps he could have build a strong relationship with another management team
with the indians it be already there
i want to be in a place where i think it would bring out the good in me francona say
so when i go in to interview with chris i know
it ' funny i hear people say
oh he know they be go to spend money or he would not have take the job
i never ask
the indians do spend last winter sign the free agent michael bourn and nick swisher
both have have down year by their standard yet the indians be a half game out of a wild card spot after tuesday 's 5 3 victory over the royals
the indians whose pitching have come on strong in the second half play the lowly astros white sox and twins after this series
that give them a strong chance to make the playoff for the first time since 2007 when francona 's red sox stop them one win short of make the world series
we would not be where we be without tito antonetti say
the impact he ' make on our organization not just the major league team have be profound
tito be the name of francona 's father an all star outfielder for the indians in 1961 and the name baseball people use for terry
the decision to manage the indians have nothing to do with family history francona say but it make for a touching moment
francona do not decorate his office at progressive field when the indians hire him last october
but when the team arrive there for its first home game in april he find vintage family photo from cleveland on the wall
that ' the way this organization ' be francona say
it ' not family but it ' about as close as you can get to that feeling
so i just want so bad to do the right thing
i get a little careful when they say i be change the culture or be responsible for that
i want to be a part of that but it ' us do it together
it ' a complete team effort and that ' why it ' work
francona 54 mesh well in boston with theo epstein a much young general manager who do not play professionally
antonetti 38 fit the same description
he be an assistant in 2001 when francona work for the indians and immediately win francona 's respect
antonetti be the smart person in the room francona say but never condescend
after his introductory news conference in cleveland last fall francona fly to arizona with antonetti who have a home in goodyear where the indians train
francona stay over and fit right in

i feel so comfortable i be walk around his house in my underwear
francona say
there ' just no barrier
i can tell him anything and i have and i know that when he leave my office he ' get my back

to prevent the emergence of reproduction detroit in china audit team from beijing have fan out across the country in recent week to check the book of local government and state run company several chinese news outlet quote the communist party friendly hong kong base ta kung pao newspaper as say
ta kung pao call it the big and most effective debt audit in chinese history
mr. snyder an accountant by training whose twitter username be @onetoughnerd be diplomatic about give advice when answer the first question from a chinese reporter at a medium event at the china club in beijing
i be proud to say i be the token accountant governor in the united states he say
his translator look puzzled
yeah
the only one he add helpfully
i may not be very exciting but we balance our book and pay our debt
point make
over all with respect to chinese municipality what i would say be i would not want to speak about them specifically because one thing be there ' many way to deal with debt question he say
detroit be relatively unique in term of have a huge debt burden
i would say that chinese municipality may find it interesting to watch how we handle thing in detroit because we be put in place a number of best practice to help better manage long term debt as we emerge from the restructuring he say
earlier in an interview with american reporter mr. snyder have be a little more specific
be an old accountant i could probably put you to sleep he say
a key problem be that local government frequently build budget upon inaccurate revenue forecasting he say
so what they will do quite often be they will go through a political process to come up with what their revenue estimate be then discover it be an unreal assessment he say
that be the single most likely area where a municipality will blow it on a consistent basis
as any good business manager know a way to get out of debt be to increase revenue
and the governor be here not to dispense advice to china but to sell michigan and detroit
his pitch covered trade and tourism and it hit the spot in cultural term
chinese value fresh food want to fish in one of michigan 's thousand of lake then eat your morning catch for lunch
play golf or buy a waiting list only michigan make wristwatch
import blueberry an increasingly popular food here
how about a big slice of the global automotive business sum up by the legendary persona of hengli fute or henry ford a household name here
the state of michigan and detroit have an awful lot to offer be the carefully calibrate message
one of the thing i think be really important be to recognize the comeback of detroit be already under way he tell the american reporter
jobs be be create and building buy and there be even a squeeze on downtown and midtown housing he say
but there be also land for sale more than 30 square mile or about 80 square kilometer
that may be something real estate focus china would be interested in but the governor seem careful not to appear too needy
he push back on the suggestion that detroit be a distressed asset
it ' the value place to go he say
not the distressed asset one i would not use the word distressed
it ' really a value opportunity
detroit be go to come back in any case he say
what i would say be i think chinese investment could be an important influence and accelerator to the comeback
but again it be not a central piece of it but it could be a very helpful and useful piece that could be mutually beneficial
it be mr. snyder 's third trip to china in three year take in chongqing and shanghai too and he have bring michigan businesspeople with him
there be also a foray to japan over a week in all
it be bill mostly as a relationship building exercise but there be already evidence of real chinese investment
in december chongqing helicopter investment company buy enstrom helicopter corporation in the city of menominee
in may work begin on an expansion expect to nearly double the size of its facility add 150 to 200 new job accord to statement on the company web site
but the tough edge of china 's development strategy long focus on acquire technology from develop country by any method necessary whether legal illegal or extralegal be also on display during the governor 's visit
you invite chinese company to invest in detroit and michigan a reporter for global times a nationalistic newspaper own by people 's daily the communist party flagship say at the chinese medium event
do you think it be possible for the chinese company to get access to some key technology in the u.s. company especially in the automobile sector
mr. snyder do not directly answer that question instead underline that he would support chinese company in find talent and build their customer and supplier relationship the most important thing for long term business success

washington senior house republicans on wednesday accuse the state department of fail to hold senior department official accountable for security failure that contribute to the attack on the american diplomatic mission in benghazi libya last year in which four americans be kill
no state department personnel have be fire or even discipline say representative ed royce republican of california who lead the house foreign affairs committee
no one have miss a paycheck
mr. royce 's comment open the first of three hearing this week that the house republican leadership have schedule as part of its scrutiny of the administration 's conduct before during and after the attack on the mission and on a nearby c.i.a. annex on sept. 11 2012
republican have accuse the administration of ignore request from american diplomat in libya for additional security in the month before the attack and of fail to launch a military response to blunt the attack once they be under way
they also say the administration have place blame on midlevel official for mistake they say may have extend all the way to hillary rodham clinton who be secretary of state at the time
the obama administration and its democratic allies on capitol hill have reject these criticism argue that the state department have move swiftly to carry out 29 recommendation make by an independent review panel in december to improve security and training
they have accuse republicans of politicize the attack for partisan gain
at wednesday 's hearing mr. royce and other republicans take direct aim at patrick f. kennedy the under secretary for management whose office oversee diplomatic security for what they say be a lack of accountability at the department for the failure benghazi reveal
mr. kennedy respond that the four midlevel state department official remove from their post and place on administrative leave last december have be reassign to job in which they no longer have worldwide decision make authority for security
to me that be serious accountability mr. kennedy say
reassignment just do not cut it mr. royce say
representative ileana ros lehtinen a florida republican add state continue to merely shuffle the deck chair
more broadly mr. kennedy say that despite improvement make by the department in the past several month include additional marine corps security guard and diplomatic security personnel diplomacy abroad be an inherently dangerous job
we will do everything we can to deter and mitigate the effectiveness of any attack he say but we will not even with willing and capable government as our partner stop terrorist or extremist from mount attack against us in all case
the independent inquiry into the attack against the benghazi mission conduct by a panel call the accountability review board that be lead by thomas r. pickering a retire senior diplomat blame the state department 's diplomatic security bureau and another department office for fail to coordinate and plan adequate security
the inquiry also find that several diplomatic security official show poor leadership
as a result of the board 's recommendation the state department by later this fall plan to have dozen of additional diplomatic security agent at high threat embassy and million of dollar worth of advanced fire survival gear and surveillance camera in those diplomatic post
it also plan to improve training for employee head to the risky mission
but diplomat and lawmaker have warn it will take year and billion more dollar to fully carry out the change call for by mr. pickering 's panel
the state department late last year appoint for the first time a senior official a deputy assistant secretary of state to ensure that embassy and consulate in dangerous place get sufficient attention
but a separate review panel lead by mark sullivan a former secret service director conclude this month that with american embassy and consulate face an increase threat of terrorist attack the diplomatic security office be mire in the department 's sprawling bureaucracy and must be elevate in importance
mr. sullivan 's panel recommend create a new under secretary job to oversee diplomatic security a proposal mr. kennedy say be under review
mr. royce also raise concern that a year after the attack in benghazi not one terrorist perpetrator have be capture or kill despite the president say that this be his high priority
the justice department have indict suspect in the attack
american intelligence official have a general idea of where they be hide but they have not be capture
some military and law enforcement official have grow frustrated with what they believe be the white house 's unwillingness to pressure the libyan government to make the arrest or allow american force to do so current and former senior government official say
on thursday the house oversight and government reform committee will hear testimony from mr. pickering and another panel member adm. mike mullen a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as well as from mr. sullivan
a house armed services committee panel will also meet thursday to examine the military 's preparedness to respond to attack like the one in benghazi

after week of vociferous objection by faculty member pennsylvania state university say on wednesday it be suspend part of a new employee wellness program that some professor have criticize as coercive and financially punitive
in particular the university say it be suspend a $ 100 monthly noncompliance fee that be to be levy on employee who decline to fill out an online questionnaire
the form administer by webmd health services a health management company ask employee for intimate detail about their job marital situation and finance
it also ask female employee whether they plan to become pregnant over the next year
last week in an emotionally charged faculty senate meeting hold on the main campus several female professor tell administrator that require woman to answer such question or pay a fine amount to an invasion of their privacy
in a statement on wednesday rodney a. erickson the president of penn state say that the university have heed faculty concern about the perceive invasiveness of the questionnaire and the punitive nature of the fine
we have decide to suspend the $ 100-per month surcharge so that people who be uncomfortable with any aspect of the survey will not feel as if they be be penalize mr. erickson say in the statement
many employer use financial incentive to encourage employee to participate in workplace wellness program a trend that be likely to widen with the new health care law
under the wellness rule for the affordable care act that take effect next january company can offer a reward of up to 30 percent of health cost for employee who complete a participatory program like a risk assessment or biometric test like waist measurement
but the uproar at penn state illustrate the pitfall employer can face in impose incentive base wellness program without first obtain employee support
on a large level it suggest that employer increase effort to cut their health care cost be on a collision course with employee boundary about medical privacy
the big picture here be that with the affordable care act the amount of the incentive have grow significantly and employer be jump into this say michael o'donnell the director of the health management research center at the university of michigan
we be go to see stop and start as people figure out how to do that
penn state adopt the wellness program which currently apply to nonunion employee include professor and staff at the recommendation of highmark health services a company that administer penn state 's health care claim
that lead some faculty member to criticize administrator for adopt a wellness program without seek input on its design from outside expert
in its statement on wednesday the university say it would now form a joint task force with faculty member to seek expert advice on both the adoption of the wellness program and health benefit matter generally
industry expert also say penn state stumble by use a stick rather than a carrot approach to motivate employee
professor complain for instance that the $ 100 monthly fine seem like a strong arm tactic consider that some employee earn less than $ 50,000 annually
the original plan come under heavy criticism last weekend on social medium
wellness plan cause trouble dr. eric topol a prominent cardiologist post on his twitter feed
a better model desperately need
i 'd object to webmd 's wellness questionnaire too janice mccallum a health data marketing strategist post on twitter
penn state institute the wellness plan in an effort to slow double digit annual growth in its health expenditure
the university be self insure which mean that it directly cover the health cost of some 40,000 employee spouse and dependent at an estimated cost this fiscal year of $ 217 million
penn state faculty member welcome the university 's decision to suspend the noncompliance fee and to set up a task force to seek faculty input on possible alternative

by remove the penalty at least temporarily they have remove the sticking point that be the big concern for employee say matthew c. woessner an associate professor of political science
it give us hope that whatever future program they undertake it will be undertake with due diligence and high ethical standard

both number be up slightly from the show 's premiere episode a year ago
the mindy project however show what may be a worrisome falloff from new girl drop to just under four million viewer and a 1.9 rating in the 18 49 group
fox which be also offer projection of how its show will fare when delay viewing be count offer some hope for mindy suggest it could eventually reach more than six million viewer and climb to a 2.7 rating among those young adult viewer
that would still be a sizable falloff from new girl which fox think could get as high as more than 10.5 million viewer and perhaps a 4.7 rating in the 18 49 category

moscow russia sharply criticize the new united nations report on syria 's chemical arm use on wednesday as biased and incomplete harden the kremlin 's defense of the syrian government even while press ahead with a plan to disarm its arsenal of the internationally ban weapon
the russians also escalate their critique of western government interpretation of the report which offer the first independent confirmation of a large chemical weapon assault on aug. 21 on the outskirt of syria 's capital damascus that asphyxiate hundred of civilian
although the report do not assign blame for that assault to either side in syria 's civil war analysis of some of the evidence it present point directly at elite military force loyal to syria 's president bashar al assad
the united states britain france and human right and nonproliferation group also say that the report 's detailed annex on the type of weapon use the large volume of poison ga they carry and their trajectory lead to the conclusion that the force of mr. assad be culpable
the russian criticism come as the united nations security council 's five permanent member begin a second day of talk on a draft resolution aim at ensure that the syrian government honor its commitment to identify and surrender all chemical munition for destruction step it officially agree to take under a deal negotiate saturday by russia and the united states that avert a punitive american missile strike on syria
russian news report quote the country 's deputy foreign minister sergei a. ryabkov as say during a visit to damascus that syria 's government have provide additional information that show insurgent use chemical weapon not only on aug. 21 but also on other occasion
the syrians offer no such information to the united nations chemical weapon inspector before they leave syria with a trove of forensic sample on aug. 31
the inspector have say they will return to syria to investigate other report instance of chemical weapon use but no date have be announce
mr. ryabkov speak after meet with mr. assad and his foreign minister walid al moallem
he do not disclose the precise nature of the additional information the syrians have convey to him but he be blunt about his criticism of the report present on monday at the united nations
we be unhappy about this report mr. ryabkov say in remark broadcast by the state television network rt.
we think that the report be distort
it be one sided
the basis of information upon which it be build be insufficient
he also say russia need to learn and know more on what happen beyond and above that incident of aug. 21
russia 's foreign minister sergey v. lavrov have also question the united nations report though not as harshly
mr. lavrov who broker the deal with secretary of state john kerry to put syria 's chemical weapon under international supervision say tuesday that there be still serious ground to believe that the aug. 21 attack be a provocation carry out by the rebel
as he have many time mr. assad in an interview conduct tuesday and broadcast wednesday on fox news deny that his government be responsible for the attack
we do not use any chemical weapon outside damascus he say
mr. assad also say syria would comply with the chemical weapon agreement which he estimate would cost $ 1 billion and take about a year
ask about the russian criticism martin nesirky a spokesman for ban ki moon the united nations secretary general say it have be clear to everyone that the chemical weapon inspector be focus first on the aug. 21 attack because of its magnitude and be plan to return to syria to investigate other accusation with a more comprehensive report to follow
mr. nesirky also take issue with the russian portrayal of the report as biased
the finding in that report be indisputable he say at a midday briefing
this be a thoroughly objective report on that specific incident
foreign minister laurent fabius of france who have just visit with mr. lavrov react angrily to the russian accusation say they have surprise him
nobody can question the objectivity of the people appoint by the u.n. mr. fabius be quote by agence france presse
russia which like the other permanent security council member have veto power be resist coercive language in the draft offer by the western member that could lead to military intervention in syria
the russian position appear intend to sow enough doubt to call into question additional pressure on syria 's government and perhaps to cloud evidence that at least some of the country 's arsenal be of soviet origin

milan be there one thousand and one nights when you could go out wear a gucci dress visible bra under sheer mesh top and a skirt with a digitally enlarge art deco pattern
there be probably many hundred of dress up evening available to the glam slam clientele whom the designer frida giannini seem to be after
they be the people for whom the 1980 of happy memory be rather too low key although they may like the sporty vibe run through the gucci show giant t shirt suede bomber jacket silken jogging pant and mesh top cut out of strip of suede that also dangle as fringe from the black bamboo handle of shoulder bag
seldom have active wear look so big and bold
but it seem a shame after all that gym exercise and tone that nothing be design to fit although shapely leg emerge from slit in the floaty dress
ms. giannini have the word for it ethereal physicality
backstage the designer also say erte refer to the pseudonym of the graphic designer romain de tirtoff whose distinctive print define the 1920s and who famously create ensemble for paul poiret 's the thousand and second night ball in 1911
what do all that historical background mean for gucci
gorgeous color rich and deep but dark especially for summer
the orange and pink in sinuous pattern give way to purple pink and those greenery yallery color of the era
ms. giannini have have other bout of historic inspiration some of which have be brilliant others less so
this show be in the latter category because the clothes need rigorous line not slithery softness to make sense of the pattern
and because orientalism with its kimono sleeve and elongated silhouette look too much like costume
maybe sport and cocktail just do not mix so well
and the visible bra surely be even for the flashy wearer well past its sell by date

stefano go to the archive and select color and material but have it redo in a modern way say mr zegna
at the beginning there be a lot of picture of natural life with greenery and baby lamb
it be go back to our root

we be in a period of weak demand frederic gagey the airline 's chief executive say after a three hour meeting with air france employee council
we be face the full brunt of the cyclicality of air transport

but he expect the additional measure will restore the company to profitability by the end of 2014

negotiation with union on the new cut will begin on oct. 4 the company say
i believe the whole company be mobilize to confront this second challenge mr. de juniac say
air france which have some of the high labor cost among european airline have struggle to remain competitive in the face of the region 's prolonged economic downturn stubbornly high fuel expense and fierce competition from the region 's low cost carrier

michel salomon a spokesman for the air france branch of the union the confederation franã§aise democratique du travail acknowledge that the current economic situation have leave air france in fragile health and that significant reduction be unavoidable
but he question whether management 's target could be achieve solely through voluntary mean
the number be extremely heavy he say
without offer extremely attractive term there be no guarantee that they will be able to avoid layoff
air france be one of several european flag carrier overhaul their operation by reduce flight and shut down unprofitable route while increase investment in low cost subsidiary that compete head to head with the like of ryanair and easyjet
but analyst say pressure from the french government which own a 15.9 percent stake in air france to limit layoff last year may have lead management to be less aggressive in its initial restructuring plan
the first wave be not sufficient to reach the target set by the company say yan derocles an airline analyst at oddo securities in paris
they may have be a bit timid he say note that compare with peer like lufthansa of germany or british airways there be still a huge gap in term of the flexibility of employee the number of hour for the pilot and cabin crew etc
mr. de juniac concede wednesday that the plan announce last year have not go far enough
the new measure which he vow would be sufficient be expect to yield an additional 400 million euro to 450 million euro or $ 534 million to $ 601 million in cost saving by the end of 2014
despite the slow than expect progress the airline 's overhaul have begin to bear fruit

she be train first in dublin and then in london at central saint martins where the guidance of louise wilson who direct the master 's course at the prestigious fashion school bring out a strong focus
or as the designer put it after two year with louise i know my own identity exactly what i want to say with my clothes
i be naturally attract to feminine thing but i want to bring them somewhere different or to put together in a wrong way ms. rocha say
this show her seventh be about that edgy femininity where black dress light in weight and with crunchy or shiny surface work through to a feather light gilded brocade look material
the fabric be mostly undefinable material like patent cotton and flower embroider plastic that she and her team develop work with mill in a spirit of modernity
then as always there be the classic pearl her signature motif milky white against the black and inject a serene prettiness by edge knee high stocking or decorate chunky accessory
her shoe be already collector item
it be rare for an emerge designer to have such a clear vision
the show seem to contain her life circle where she now live in the gritty edginess of dalston in london 's rundown east end even if ms. rocha have just move into a spanking new studio with her tiny work force create crochet craftwork under frame image of francis bacon 's gut wrench art

tired of be thrust onto the front line of the nation 's debate over gun starbucks be ask customer to leave firearm behind when they be in its store and its outdoor seating area
the policy change come after a shooting rampage at the washington navy yard on monday that leave 13 people include the gunman dead
but starbucks say its decision be not in response to that or to the shooting spree that kill 26 child and adult at the sandy hook elementary school in newtown conn. just day before christmas last year
i 've spend a significant amount of personal time on this issue in the last several month and i have see the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it be on both side howard schultz the chief executive of starbucks say in a telephone interview
nevertheless customer in many store have be jar and fairly uncomfortable to see gun in our store not understand the issue and feel that gun should not be part of the starbucks experience especially when small kid be around
under the change baristas and other store employee will not ask customer who come in with gun in holster say to leave or confront them in any way mr. schultz say
no sign explain the policy will be post in starbucks store either
we be go to serve them as we would serve anyone else he say
there be go to be people on both side who will be disappoint or angry but we 're make a decision we think be in the best interest of our customer employee and the company
he say store official would evaluate compliance over time and consider post sign if necessary
a majority of company own starbucks store be in state that allow people to openly carry gun although restriction and limitation vary from state to state
the company have have a handful of armed robbery in its store over the year as well as two recent incident where gun carry in woman 's purse have discharge accidentally but little other gun violence in its store
under its previous policy however starbucks have be unwillingly co opt by proponent of open carry policy and vilify by those seek strict law on gun ownership
garry trudeau devote six consecutive day of his doonesbury comic strip in 2010 to mock the company 's stance which open with a barista greet a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and say welcome to starbucks sir
would you be openly carry a weapon today
pro gun activist have use our store as a political stage for medium event misleadingly call starbucks appreciation day that disingenuously portray starbucks as a champion of open carry mr. schultz write in an open letter to be publish in ad in major newspaper
last month starbucks close a store in newtown early after gun right supporter wear camouflage and connecticut citizens defense league t shirt hold one of their event there
similarly opponent of military style assault weapon in store like the group moms demand action for gun sense in america which advocate skip starbucks sundays have stag protest outside starbucks store and urge consumer to boycott the company

it sound like howard schultz be make a very good business decision say brian malte director of legislation and mobilization at the brady campaign

lot of family with child college student and young people be starbucks customer and they want to feel safe
the company have long follow local law regard the ability to carry gun in plain sight
customer in the 44 state that allow legal gun owner to carry weapon openly have be permit in its store there while those in the six other state new york california south carolina illinois florida and texas have not accord to the law center to prevent gun violence
i want to make it very clear that starbucks be not a policy maker and as a company we be not pro- or anti gun mr. schultz say
however there have be a number of episode over the course of the last few month that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open carry
most other restaurant chain and retailer follow policy similar to the one starbucks be abandon although peet 's coffee and tea and california pizza kitchen ban gun from their store altogether
disney also forbid gun in its theme park and costco do not allow its member to carry them openly in its store
while peet 's coffee and tea respect and value all individual right under the law like many other private retail establishment our policy be not to allow customer carry firearm in our store or on our outdoor seating premise unless they be uniformed or identified law enforcement officer the company say in a statement forward by a spokeswoman
a spokeswoman for the national restaurant association say the organization do not have a list of its member policy on gun but note that some state that have open carry law on the book still prohibit public display of firearm in restaurant

she keep look
as time pass ms. strachan 's budget rise
initially she think $ 400,000 would be adequate
after all her friend in other city have enormous house for less
all of a sudden i be at $ 600,000 and o.k. with it she say
her saving be sufficient at sea she have pay no room and board so her expense have be low
she raise her price to $ 700,000 and that ' where we start to see more of what she like say ms. vatamanu who suspect what she want be likely to be find on the upper east side
ms. strachan like quite a few place there include one on east 79th street with a floor plan that include a foyer and even a couple of short hallway

i be get excited just in the hallway
this apartment with its many build in bookshelf live up to its building
ms. strachan be especially pleased by the floor plan which have a large foyer that branch out like a t or a cross she say
you can walk into any room and circle around
you could hava nagila in the apartment

i never think i would like yellow in a kitchen but this be the cutest i have ever see she say
though the view out the back be not especially sunny it be quintessentially so new york with brick wall and fire escape
however there be other apartment on her list to check out
a one bedroom on east 86th street also have build in bookshelf as well as a washer dryer in the kitchen
the price be $ 675,000 with monthly maintenance in the mid-$1,300
the subway be just downstairs
but the immediate neighborhood seem too commercial with big box retailer on the block

the hustle and bustle of the best buy be way too much for me she say
i want to walk out of the building and feel peaceful
so it be back to the one bedroom in the 70 which she buy for $ 631,000 after split the 2 percent flip tax with the seller

people tend to look away when the action be too near them as if they do not want to intrude on actor act
not that the compass rose direct by david sullivan would be much better on a traditional stage

the film which open in new york and los angeles on sept. 6 include some detail of salinger 's relationship with young woman include an account of his long run involvement with jean miller whom he meet when she be 14 and he be 30

the script be to be write by mr. salerno weinstein say
the late designer store to join the bustling retail scene that surround howard street in soho an area pioneer by open ceremony be around the corner at 148 lafayette street
if the address ring a bell that be because it have appear for 17 year on the label of one of fashion 's quiet success story
lafayette 148 as the company be know be so quiet that you will not even notice the store from the street it be on the eighth floor and as yet there be no sign
though it start with several store in the new york area in the late 1990 the company know primarily for career orient sportswear that be originally manufacture at its soho headquarters have focus for the last decade on its department store business and its own online and catalog sale
now it have 1,500 employee and a state of the art factory in shantou china
over the last two year three store have open in china with a fourth opening next week).â
but still customer show up at the office on lafayette street look for a store
so it all point in one direction say deirdre quinn the chief executive and a founder of lafayette 148 with shun yen siu her partner in china
earlier this year as floor become available in the building lafayette 148 which maintain its showroom administrative office and sample make facility there expand
the eighth floor be choose for the store ms. quinn say to reflect its symbolism for luck in chinese culture
it be for the same reason that the price of all of its design end in an eight
and with 4,000 square foot the company be able to create the kind of environment that be not possible in a traditional department store with a full range of size include petite and plus size category that have largely be drop by manhattan retailer
the store which be open to the public on weekday begin this week and also by appointment be an experiment for customer as much as it be a showcase for the retailer who shop the line there
in this setting lafayette 148 can present the line as it would want show luxury item and jewelry and calfskin tote even custom evening dress not just the $ 248 white shirt in stretch cotton for which it be know
of its more than 100,000 online customer about 10 percent live in the metropolitan region but many of them still want to try on clothes before buy
rather than opening in every mall in america we want to find our own path say paul lechlinski the company 's vice president for retail service
the elevator open onto a bright floor with window face east and west just above the rooftop of neighbor building
a spiral silver sculpture choose because it resemble a figure eight sit on a table near abstract black and white painting by the company 's longtime design director edward wilkerson
at the front of one rack be a rich burgundy calfskin jacket with laser cut edge for $ 1,998 in another display a camel to citron double face cashmere jacket with leather trim for $ 698
there be also some serious statement jewelry like an 18-karat gold plat brass necklace that resemble a sea anemone
a department store may be nervous about order many of these design but the company can still produce them in limited quantity in as little as three week
while there be an obvious risk that no one will recognize there be a store upstairs ms. quinn say there be other advantage to be in the same building in which the product be design
alteration for example can be handle by the original patternmaker downstairs
and if customer want a sneak preview of spring they can always stop by the showroom on 2
brilliant or foolhardy
there be time during tuesday night 's fabulously entertaining new york philharmonic concert at avery fisher hall when i find myself debate the pro and con of the conceit behind hitchcock the first of two program in the art of the score film week at the philharmonic
under the direction of constantine kitsopoulos the philharmonic perform extract of score to hitchcock classic include vertigo
north by northwest and stranger on a train as scene from the film play on a large screen above
from the side of the stage the actor alec baldwin provide introduction and insightful commentary
if the plan be to attract large number of philharmonic newbie with a combination of contemporary celebrity sparkle and old hollywood polish it work the hall be pack and the crowd as diverse as any i have see at lincoln center
present a week before the official opening of the season film week which also include performance of stanley kubrick 's 2001 a space odyssey be like a platter of delicious amuse bouches design to drive traffic to the more substantial fare
but with alfred hitchcock 's genius compete for attention be anyone really listen to the orchestra
as cary grant in a scene from to catch a thief streak over the roof with catlike grace while french detective roar through the countryside in hot pursuit of a car that sacre bleu
carry only the housekeeper do anyone pay attention to the rhythmical verve and bite humor of lyn murray 's score
when grace kelly wrestle with the nighttime attacker send to strangle her in dial m for murder do anyone notice the orchestra 's glorious sound in dimitri tiomkin 's dark and powerful score with its allusion to the coronation scene from mussorgsky 's boris godunov
as mr. baldwin point out hitchcock be deeply serious about music in his film recognize its power to express character hidden desire and weave it into a movie so skillfully that it become ingrained in the visual fabric
the score to his film also become important marketing tool
a symphonic suite base on the score of rebecca be widely tour after the movie 's release in the case of spellbound the score in a recording conduct by leopold stokowski be broadcast on the radio even before the film 's release
one of the most fruitful collaboration be that between hitchcock and the composer bernard herrmann who compose score for seven hitchcock film include psycho north by northwest and vertigo
in the last film especially herrmann 's music establish a vocabulary of psychological state that be then use to underscore or undermine the character action the dizzy triplet denote vertigo the screech dissonant chord express the terror as the protagonist dangle from a tall building peer down into the abyss the luscious sigh string that accompany the obsessive love story
the philharmonic play the score to the vertigo hotel scene with wagnerian urgency
the string produce a gorgeous rich sound that cool into a light queasy timbre as james stewart stand at the window bath in green neon light
at that moment the concert feel like more than a case of luxury casting and become a vindication of the always self efface but often brilliant work of film composer
2001 a space odyssey will be present with live music from the new york philharmonic conduct by alan gilbert on friday and saturday at avery fisher hall lincoln center 212 875 5656 nyphil.org
london this week tom ford open his 89th store in london where his company have its headquarters
we 're in baku he say as he reel off city that presumably will carry his mirror spangle dress next spring
for its show burberry invite the impossibly cute harry styles of one direction and the it girl suki waterhouse
england be home to some world conquer fashion brand that derive a lot of their success from retail expertise and so call entry point product like perfume and sunglass
as it happen both mr. ford and christopher bailey of burberry make strong statement on their runway
in fact mr. ford say he be really into an athletic look woman hence the exaggerated shoulder of his leather outfit the tapered waist and the leggy skirt
i be not think about 80 supermodel he say
pour into evening outfit that look as if they be shoot out of a can of black silly string and then seemingly bake with a girdle of foil his model definitely be more molten than glamorous
mr. ford 's spring daywear such as it be consist of buckle tight brown or white leather jacket cinch black pantsuit and a slinky leather mesh tank top with a black and white leather skirt in a bubble pattern
those outfit echo his day at gucci
but the evening clothes be in new territory both in term of style and technique
the one pave with glitter fragment be a bit elvis or rihanna but they dissolve conventional line between dress up and performance
that ' not trivial when you consider how dull most red carpet fashion be
mr. ford say he get the idea for the mad squiggle and break bit from the work of artist he admire like jose parla and mark bradford
you will have to take his word for it that get into a cobweb be a cinch
mr. bailey 's collection be more accessible
for starter he call it english rose

aside from the pink and custard tone the clothes nicely combined tradition and modern styling lace for pencil skirt be produce in nottingham england
he show them with shirt or plain cashmere sweater
and instead of reinvent the trench coat in a gazillion fabric as he have do before he give the audience a breather with soft roomy coat in all those melt english color
of course many people count on london for more than a garden party
yet this be a tough season for young designer who once have a novel idea like the ecstatic print of mary katrantzou and now seem to be toil in the same path
ms. katrantzou create print from blow up image of shoe but her fussy shape hold her back
i keep wonder why she do not try softer thing like pajama pant and tunic
erdem be another label determine to make a shrine out of couture too many veiled garment
as i go around london to place and street fill with ordinary people i have the sense more than ever that fashion here be take place in vacuum
do they care about christopher kane 's naã¯ve drape and twisted flower dress
or j. w. anderson 's break down skirt or dress with panel array with row of what resemble tiny takeout box in fabric what he call avant bland
if the public do not appear to be even remotely listen whom be we talk to
i actually blame the young star
they be not be as innovative as they need to be
it ' that simple
you can fool the fashion press with a gimmick or a cool bit of styling but you can not fool ordinary people
and the public always recognize heart stop fashion as it do for designer from chanel to mcqueen
mr. kane have some lovely thing pleated skirt in delicate slightly shimmery fabric a black pantsuit and some pastel dress with petal shaped cutout rim in silver
but he spread himself too thin
he show sweatshirt with feminine skirt a style similar to one he have do in the past
last year it be a frankenstein t shirt with a lace skirt
but since riccardo tisci of givenchy make a big statement for fall with the same sweatshirt look maybe mr. kane should have move on
when i look back over his last four or five collection there ' a clear evolve body of design
this time i saw too many trick like dress with cord suspend draping
he show some shift crowd with abstract flower applique and lace arrow
he have work with lace and applique before
but again be he advance the idea or merely amplify it
in may raf simons create a dior resort collection with floral embroider lace
mr. anderson owe a clear debt to the japanese designer of the 80
and it ' o.k. to be inspire by them who have not be but he run the risk of serve up avant garde lite
also base on thing i see of his in store he be quite a clever designer so i do not understand the need for all the runway craftiness unless it ' just to get medium attention
thomas tait by contrast do a lot with a little
he use white leather superfine knit some feather and athletic nylon and create an elegant thoroughly unpretentious collection
though the fabric be mostly practical they 're beautifully cut
he too like a skirt and a top maybe with a lightweight coat but he bend the look to his aesthetic
it ' not a 50s pencil skirt it ' loose almost runny
if i saw a woman in these clothes i would be curious
also worth pay attention to next spring be simone rocha for her pretty full skirt dress trace with pearl jonathan saunders for a broad use of sporty separate like boyish tricolor suede jacket and satin short and paula gerbase of the minimalist label 1205 who have an implacable eye for proportion
the meadham kirchhoff designer get a little kitschy with their europa fairy tale but they make gingham and white eyelet skirt look tempting
their jacket be handsome too
round out the show be l'wren scott 's use of tagasode whose sleeve 16th century japanese screen depict garment drape on stand as if wait for their occupant to return
well there ' a sorcery quality in her femininity too and she bring it out with vivid red fan pattern black lace and a crisp silhouette for daytime tweed and cotton
bill callahan may be easy to describe by what he be not quite a folkie a country singer a cloistered primitivist weirdo with a four track recorder a poet or some other kind of word only artist
over the last 23 year on a string of record make almost exclusively for the chicago label drag city you sense that he ' walk past those door revise his idea wait look for something
he ' find it
listen through his astonishing new album dream river and you will hear line up neatly his trademark
they have be float around in his work recently though perhaps not so deliberately they do not seem like trademark until now
but dream river be evidence of a system a work formula
here be mr. callahan 's baritone voice float lightly in middle range and make quick and confident deep dive put strange bend on a phrase
here be an image of a man alone in a hotel room image of eagle and water in fact of an eagle fly over water alive and enjoy the ride
the idea of motion for its own sake be another callahan trademark
a ripple phase effect on mr. callahan 's rhythm guitar strumming like waylon jennings have in the mid-'70
a small band with minimal percussion sometimes only conga and clave stick play spacious and ominous live arrangement in waltz or habanera through song that pause and turn in strange place
word or expression ritually express in two or three
and a narrative action first describe and then imitate like this from the album 's first track the sing the only word i have say today be beer and thank you beer
/thank you/beer
thank you beer
mr. callahan be now 47 and have be base in austin tex
for almost a decade
in the frequently scrappy or bitter music he make under the name smog begin in 1990 and then since he start use his own name on record in 2007 he ' be change ensemble sound and strategy make his work more country or less more minimal or less more disruptive or less
his work have suggest a great struggle to make song that be both emotionally affect and explosion of imply meaning a kind of semantic epistemological metaphysical event
he seem to want to put everything in them now love death fear patience transfiguration
he just do not want to say any of it outright
this level of subtlety be not common in pop
plenty of songwriter be oblique but mr. callahan want to connect
his record be literary without have a lot of word they 're methodical slow drip of charge idea that settle in the brain like a long poem or a novel
this one in particular be almost transparent a wind blow through it
with a group of austin musician that have become more stable over the last few album he ' make a complex procedure sound easy
mr. callahan 's introverted voice refine as it have become over the year may never lose its essential awkwardness he can still use it perversely
this record 's final song winter road have a smash closer on paper i have learn when thing be beautiful/ to just keep on
yet he stretch out be and just the two dull word of the couplet into long froggy croak over an f minor chord it ' a weirdly flat foot move at an important moment
he have a unify band sound now and have let his lead line instrumental player take major role in it beth galiger on flute bring a hopeful sound to a heavy hearted scene and matt kinsey on electric guitar be miraculous
use echo and delay pedal and a tremolo bar mr. kinsey keep creep in burst like a pink sky and slip away
his work on this record feel like one continuous performance and one of the best by anyone i have hear this year
mr. callahan have say that he care about put a kind of buried story line in his record from song to song
i do not know about that but there be a single consciousness that hold together dream river
there ' always a force threaten to drag the narrator under in these song an icy road a storm a mate 's deep sleep gravity
his character be confused without admit it and they 're infantile around love abjectly grateful for its power seek or offer it impulsively
on javelin unlanding he sing do not die just yet and leave me alone alone alone
on this journey round the sun love be central to the record anyway through all the subterfuge and indirection
this be an album in which a song that ' actually about flying small plane be one level deep about a trust relationship and possibly an even better song about sex
yet the next song spring be explicitly about sex the key couplet be all i want to do be to make love to you/ in the fertile dirt but point to something else something big and dark
what be it
disappointment decay
we call it spring though thing be die he sing
then he right himself the true spring be in you/ the true spring be in you
when the stock market prognosticator joseph e. granville talk his subscriber listen
in early 1981 for instance the dow jones industrial average dive 2.4 percent on what be then the heavy trading day in history after mr. granville urge his newsletter follower to sell everything and go short
it rebound in the follow week before tumble more than 20 percent over the next 15 month
mr. granville who die on sept. 7 at 90 be perhaps the most famous of a generation of market seer who make their own fortune in the less risky venue of the newsletter business in his case the granville market letter which he begin publish in 1963
i 'm pay to put you in at the bottom and take you out at the top he declare as he barnstorm the country with a showman 's flair drum up subscriber at investment seminar choreograph like broadway show
he once slide to the stage on a 100-foot long wire wear his standard after six tuxedo
he use puppet and clown outfit
he often play a blue song on the piano with lyric that underscore his contention that wall street brokerage be just out to make money off their customer
mr. granville write a daily market letter for e. f. hutton company before strike out on his own
at its peak in the early 1980s his near weekly newsletter have 13,000 subscriber
they pay $ 250 a year and $ 500 more for urgent alert by phone and telex as mr. granville seek to time the big gyration in the market
louis r. rukeyser who often have mr. granville on his pbs program wall street week tell people magazine in 1981 that mr. granville be the most controversial man in american finance
but while mr. granville correctly call a bear market in the late 1970 and the implosion of technology stock in 2000 he miss other major turn like the start of an epic bull run in 1982
and like many other market forecaster his overall performance be very poor compare with that of basic stock index fund say mark hulbert editor of the hulbert financial digest which have track the performance of investment advisory newsletter since 1980
mr. hulbert say that from 1980 through january 2005 mr. granville 's stock tip for investor lose 0.5 percent on an annualized basis compare with an 11.9 percent average yearly gain for a general stock index
mr. granville 's tip for more aggressive trader lose an average 10 percent a year over that period mr. hulbert say
mr. granville who continue to produce the newsletter until his death do not provide enough trading detail after january 2005 to track his performance as precisely
but he get enough of the broad turn in the market right mr. hulbert say that if investor have ignore his stock pick and buy or sell an index fund with each major call they would have earn 8.5 percent a year since 1980
he deserve some credit for insight into the market mr. hulbert say add that mr. granville create technical indicator still use by many market analyst
he die in a hospice in kansas city mo. where he be be treat for pneumonia his wife karen e. granville say
mr. granville revel in all the attention his bold call receive she say

he love that mrs. granville say in an interview
it be almost like he be on stage all the time
joseph ensign granville be bear on aug. 20 1923 in yonkers
in the book of granville reflection of a stock market prophet publish in 1984 mr. granville recall that his father have lose $ 30,000 in the stock market crash of 1929 and at least twice as much more that he borrow from grandma buck and auntie blanche
he write that his family survive only because his relative be comfortable enough to write off their loss and aid us in recover
mr. granville study economics at duke university and graduate in 1948
he also write book on bingo and investing in stamp
he be marry three time
beside his wife the former karen erickson whom he marry in 1981 he be survive by six child from his second marriage to the former paulina delp john blanchard leslie leona weissman mary beth and johanna as well as 15 grandchild and four great grandchild
an appetite for wonder be only the first half of richard dawkins 's project two volume memoir about his life in science
with typical unsentimental pragmatism he note that the companion volume should follow in two year if i be not carry off by the unpredictable equivalent of a sneeze
no one will ever accuse this highly opinionated ethologist and evolutionary biologist whose book include the selfish gene and the god delusion of a rosy attitude
this first installment read like the work of a man who have already write abundantly about himself
he often tell story that he acknowledge he have tell before
he include the text of speech he have make
and he put particular emphasis on the evolution yes he would approve of that word of the selfish gene the 1976 genetics book that establish his reputation and put the word meme on the map
with the benefit of hindsight and with a dearth of other compelling material he wonder if the immortal gene a title suggest to him by a london publisher may have be better than the one he use
i can not now remember why i do not follow his advice he write
i think i should have do
anyone expect an incisive account of mr. dawkins 's growth as a scientist may be surprised by the meandering path he take here
true his lineage be impressive and his boyhood be uncommonly adventurous so both warrant attention
he take his time explain that his great great great grandparent elope more cleverly than most couple do
henry dawkins and augusta clinton make their getaway in a coach but not before the groom to be have plant half a dozen decoy coach near augusta 's home so that her father sir henry clinton could not prevent the marriage
as the british commander in chief in america he could not win the revolutionary war either
the family history also include clinton george augustus dawkins son of the eloped couple who earn his place in family lore during the austrian bombardment of rebel venice in 1849 when a cannonball hit his bed
a cannonball penetrate the bed cover and pass between his leg but happily do him no more than superficial damage read the inscription that accompany a cannonball in mr. dawkins 's possession
the story may not be 100 percent true but it do underscore this family 's stay power
mr. dawkins 's forebear have scientific leaning of all kind
since many be post to remote corner of the british empire those leaning be more exotic than most
one cousin write major book about the bird of burma and borneo
other relative hold the post of chief conservator of the forest in india and nepal
another relative be credit with persuade aldous huxley to take mescaline and open the door of perception
as mr. dawkins have already write in a brief and more obscure memoir for generation sun brown dawkins leg have be stride in khaki short through the jungle of empire
he himself be bear in 1941 in nairobi kenya
grow up in nyasaland now malawi he lead what sound like a charm early life
this book include a lovely whimsical painting make by his mother illustrate the family 's idyllic look african life which include a pet chameleon and a pet bush baby a squirrel size big eyed mammal
mr. dawkins recall his father 's bedtime story often feature a broncosaurus which say tiddly widdly widdly in a high falsetto voice and read about doctor dolittle whose love of animal make him one of the great fairy tale naturalist
but the tone turn sharp once this bud atheist be send to a school where the pupil be compel to say a good night prayer
he say this be learn in parrot fashion and evolve into garbled meaninglessness then add tartly quite an interesting test case in meme theory if you happen to be interested in such thing if you be not and do not know what i be talk about skip to the next paragraph
this be not a book that run on charm
the second half of an appetite for wonder follow mr. dawkins back to england and into an educational system that he harshly denounce
he write about bully mortifying embarrassment sadistic punishment and an absence of critical thinking which by his light be bad of all
he still bristle at have unimaginatively be call a very inky little boy when force to have an open ink pot on his desk and keep dip a pen into it
mr. dawkins 's memory briefly take him to berkeley calif. where he live long enough to protest american involvement in the vietnam war
they finally arrive at oxford and to the beginning of his serious career in science
he present detailed description of some of his early experiment in animal behavior like an analysis of newborn chick pecking pattern
then he move on to what appear to be his calling computer science and the creation of computer language
he seek computer base method of analyze hierarchical pattern in nature and the specific of such material like his mutual replaceability cluster analysis program be not for amateur
we 're a long way from the sun brown little boy who catch butterfly
mr. dawkins treat the publication of the selfish gene as the divide line between the first and second installment of this memoir
it ' a good place to pause and it suggest strongly that the second volume will be hefty and more focused than this one
mr. dawkins 's memory for his work be much more vivid than his more personal story
and the work have be far range enough to support autobiographical study
but for now we have the kindling of mr. dawkins 's curiosity the basis for his unconventionality and some very odd glimpse of professorial behavior
mr. dawkins describe one teacher who would begin by say oh dear and
i can not hold it and i 'm go to lose my temper before warn his student to hide under their desk
and then the ink pot fly
he be a kind gentleman provoke beyond endurance as who would not be in his profession write mr. dawkins himself no stranger to provocation
who would not be in mine

the group 's performance amid italian baroque painting feature little hear sonata by dario castello giovanni battista fontana and johann kaspar kerll
these work turn on a dime slow line of ache lyricism tumble into joyous movement

no drama
that ' how jedediah wheeler the executive director of peak performances at montclair state university in new jersey describe work with liz gerring the on the rise choreographer he have choose to open his fall series on thursday

without drama be how ms. gerring have describe her own athletic abstract dance
in both statement the lack be mean as a positive
it have not always be so
ms. gerring 48 have be make dance since the mid-1990 but for the first 10 year she receive almost no recognition
when critic do start pay attention they write about idea not come to life
disturbingly bloodless be how jennifer dunning characterize ms. gerring 's work in the new york times in 2006 complain that it be only 42 minute long but 42 minute have seldom pass so slowly
what a change in 2010 when alastair macaulay review ms. gerring 's lichtung/clear as a major achievement and write in the times about watch it with his heart in his mouth
he be not the only critic to sense the opening of a new perspective and the change be not only in the view from the outside
ms. gerring herself feel that lichtung have achieve a clarity miss from her earlier work a communication of emotion and meaning through abstraction
lichtung perform in one of the baryshnikov arts center 's black box theater attract the notice of mr. wheeler
with its proscenium format and five time the seating capacity of ms. gerring 's usual space the montclair theater offer her the chance to reach a large audience and the challenge of not lose her newfound clarity while scale up
the title of the new work at an hour her long be glacier
part of mr. wheeler 's strategy for help ms. gerring manage the transition be a two week residency in the theater in june
during a run through her commentary be almost reflexively sardonic
she laugh at her dance mock its seriousness
later in the summer talk over coffee she treat her career similarly
moment of drama be immediately undercut by small mildly derisive voice come out of the side of her mouth
but self deprecation could not entirely disguise a long struggle
ms. gerring grow up in sherman oaks calif. a few valley girl locution still cling to her speech and get into dance because she do not make the gymnastics team
at 13 she start ballet late a devote student never quite good enough to consider a career
when she be in 11th grade her family move to seattle where she channel unhappiness into modern dance class at the cornish college of the arts
next come four tough year at juilliard
the composition teacher doris rudko encourage her and in dancing work by kazuko hirabayashi she fall in love with abstraction use the technique she excel at without the act that make her uncomfortable
after graduation she be at loose end
her boyfriend be a cyclist so she become one
i spend five year as this amateur racer she say stay at super 8s with four of us in the room and do these little race in vermont in the rain
well that be a waste i think when i finish she add but now she view that period as a stage of unlearn that become useful as she start over as a dancer in a studio by herself develop her own style
it ' easy to see the link to her athleticism
i be try to find same sense of push myself physically as i have in cycling she say
but perhaps the unlearning after a solid dance education be connect to what mr. macaulay would praise in 2011 as her dancer unschooled precision and her newly forge quality
for year ms. gerring 's choreographic career be sporadic with time off for the birth of her three child
her production fall beneath most reviewer radar yet as soon as she begin use body other than her own she insist upon dancer of first class ability
though her work be now often liken to merce cunningham 's and though she consider him a major influence she have take perhaps one class in cunningham technique
cunningham class though be where she ' find many of her dancer
she also acknowledge the other influence that critic identify that of the postmodernist trisha brown and though ms. gerring never study with her the two become friend
it be ms. brown who help ms. gerring weather that wither review in 2006
that review force me to take responsibility ms. gerring say
i turn a page and start over again but it be all those year that lead to lichtung work out
one continuity between ms. gerring 's early work lichtung and her new glacier be the composer michael j. schumacher whom she meet at juilliard
she usually choreograph before a score be write often while improvise to other music like pop
yet the dance and the sound in her piece be not entirely independent there be sync point cue correspondence
we 're not dance to music she say but
when it ' not there it ' like we be not able to dance
the music for glacier come first a composition mr. schumacher build from field recording at glacier lake in colorado
ms. gerring do not listen to that score while create but the natural sound be in her mind
the choreography be more gestural than her recent work
i 'm try to tell my tale a bit she say
maybe i have the confidence now not to have everyone onstage thrash around
i try to keep it strip down for as long as i feel i could
recognize ms. gerring 's attention to delicate relation between dancer the designer robert wierzel have place horizontal panel at the rear of the stage use air and volume to focus attention on the cast
the panel be as blank as movie screen
all the drama be in the dancing

the duet could have be title gala pas de deux
there be nine of those on the program follow by two solo
the monotony of format be leaven by a high ratio of choice unfamiliar to new york balletgoers
and even several of the more familiar item be welcome particularly herman cornejo and luciana paris in twyla tharp 's sinatra suite and mr. cornejo and maria kochetkova in george balanchine 's tchaikovsky pas de deux
in several way mr. cornejo be mr. bolle 's opposite small explosive
it be a sign of mr. bolle 's mod generosity that he invite mr. cornejo a dancer sure to outshine him in virtuosity and verve
the other man jason reilly of stuttgart ballet and mikhail kaniskin of berlin state ballet be good but less contrastive
another sign and the evening 's great merit be mr. bolle 's inclusion of ballerina rarely or never before see in new york
elisa carrillo cabrera a mexican bear dancer with berlin state ballet bring a strikingly clean exactitude to uwe scholz 's generic jeunehomme and some psychological complexity to mauro bigonzetti 's kazimir 's color
alicia amatriain a spaniard with stuttgart ballet be a chameleon sweet and lovely in john cranko 's choppy romeo and juliet sexy and dangerous in itzik galili 's vulgar mono lisa
in between in christian spuck 's le grand pas de deux ms. amatriain reveal herself as a superb comedian a distracted ballerina in glass make dizzy by her fouette turn
in that piece a redeemingly funny sendup of ballet gala duet mr. bolle play the straight man a role to which he be suit
in roland petit 's l'arlesienne opposite the adorable talented young italian ballerina erika gaudenzi mr. bolle 's character fall into a zombielike catatonia
this mr. bolle can do the abandon of the piece 's mad scene be beyond his control
he ' so careful you may almost call him a ballet machine
remarkably that ' what the program 's final work do
through computer graphic massimiliano volpini 's prototype present the manufacture of a ballet dancer
mr. bolle in the flesh
video behind him point out the real perfection of his form
the background shift to story ballet scene and multiply video game replication of the star
be this how mr. bolle view himself
be it a comment on his image

year ago if costume designer be know at all they work in movie
think of studio powerhouse like adrian who work on mgm production like the wizard of oz and the philadelphia story or edith head of paramount and later universal who design costume for grace kelly and audrey hepburn
today even successful movie costume designer like catherine martin who do the design for the great gatsby and trish summerville who be do the next hunger games movie and will sell a line capitol couture by trish summerville on net a porter do not exactly cut outsize figure
but as television have gain more respect as a medium there have be a coattail effect on some of its costume designer who say that their work there give them great opportunity than current cinema to influence the culture at large
the movie genre popular right now have to do with design vampire and superhero say rebecca hofherr the costume designer for elementary on cbs. tv deal with more realistic issue and more realistic clothing
and some like janie bryant of mad men on amc whose revival of midcentury style be now a frequent reference on high fashion runway be practically become brand unto themselves

although she would like to represent the designer for the show downton abbey and nashville ms. kearns say she have turn down plenty of potential client
she meet ms. bryant after ms. kearns 's business partner kristi mccormick book her for an appearance at nordstrom in seattle sponsor by joseph abboud offer style tip to man
i just have this sense she could be so much more ms. kearns say
ms. bryant point out that her field amount to a comprehensive course in clothing design
it ' so vast and so varied she say while attend new york fashion week with ms. paolo
it ' not only limited to woman 's wear it ' man 's wear child all socioeconomic background all different body
television have certainly have its share of memorable fashion moment from mary ann 's red and white gingham dress to bill cosby 's sweater
but few of its designer be widely remember other than the late nolan miller for dynasty and patricia field for sex and the city
the buzz start towards the end of the first season and by the beginning of the second it just explode ms. field say of the latter show on hbo. it be like sit at the bottom of an atom bomb

when the ambitious refurbishing of the landmark park avenue armory be complete new york will have an alternative art center unlike any in the world a national treasure that carefully weave together historical and new design while encompass industrial austerity and belle ãpoque excess
the arduous transformation involve the totality of the armory 's immense celebrated structure which be build from 1877 to 1881 by the seventh national guard regiment the state 's wealthy and most blue blooded it sometimes function a bit as an upper class man 's club
architecturally it be and remain a fabulously hybrid creation
its baronial head house loom over park avenue between 66th and 67th street behind it lie the soar strip down industrial shed of the wade thompson drill hall
the hall 's 55,000 column free square foot seem tailor make for oversize work of performance and installation art impossible for any other institution in the city to accommodate
performance begin mere month after the nonprofit park avenue conservancy lead by rebecca robertson its president and executive producer sign a 99-year lease with the state late in 2006 to restore the building and operate it as an art center and have continue nearly uninterrupted throughout the renovation
the armory restoration budget at $ 200 million with $ 120 million spend be be lead by the innovative swiss architect jacques herzog and pierre de meuron of herzog de meuron best know for convert a sprawl london power station into the tate modern
they and their team have be either study or work on the building for seven year and plan call for a 2018 completion
it be not easy to turn a grand but crumble pile that descend to the world monuments fund 's list of the world 's 100 most endangered structure in 2000 into a fully function cultural entity that also reveal a good bit of its own physical history
the nature and fruit of the carefully devise renovation process will become much more apparent on sept. 29 with the inauguration of the armory 's newly restore board of officers room as an intimate hall for music and dance recital play and performance art
it be one of the 18 room in the head house and their renovation be especially complicate
commission by either the regiment or its individual company they be do to a fare thee well of gilded age sumptuousness by the lead interior decorator and furniture maker of the day louis comfort tiffany stanford white pottier stymus and the herter brothers
over the decade they be repeatedly redo and update as style change or new technology like electricity arrive
walls be repaint ceiling redecorate new floor lay
paneling be add or change
the current restoration be be oversee by ascan mergenthaler a herzog de meuron partner in concert with the new york architect charles platt of platt bayard dovell white architects the conservancy staff and an extensive team of restorer and skilled artisan
until now the improvement have be elaborate yet largely invisible upgrade to the drill hall include air conditioning new window increase electrical power and reinforce structural support
the board of officers room be create by herter brothers among the great design firm of the late-19th century american aesthetic movement
its reopening with a recital by the baritone christian gerhaher accompany on the piano by gerold huber will be something of milestone it will bring the restoration process more fully into public view illuminate a preservation philosophy that accept flaw embrace sign of age and focus more on subtraction than addition all of which must be visible as such
the impose officer room most recently use primarily as a coat check room have be return to something remarkably close to its original glory but not quite
it do not hurt the cause that this chamber be one of the few survive herter interior show the firm 's work at its most original and that it be with the silver room at the far end of the broad first floor hall design by tiffany and restore in the 1980s probably the most important and stunning interior in the head house
it also have an austerity that fall somewhere between the starkness of the drill hall and the other busy head house room
its wall and ceiling be decorate with different pattern stencil onto solid background an economical imitation of wallpaper use throughout the head house that have be scrupulously clean and repair
its rich mahogany wainscoting pocket door and monumental fireplace relieve of layer of grime and varnish once again exude a startlingly bright shade of lustrous red
r. mark adams a herter specialist who be in charge of the meticulous restoration of the armory 's mile of woodwork say that the shade may be unique in the herter oeuvre and that it be achieve use mad root
â
the main approach in the head house be a process that mr. herzog and mr. de meuron call delayering
this mean the removal of subsequent alteration and addition where possible figure out what be do and when how much of the original decoration lurk beneath more recent layer and which treatment along a give room 's timeline should be emphasize 1 2 next page

lyon france the buzz around benjamin millepied 's l.a. dance project be undoubtedly fuel by an aura of glamour that emanate from mr. millepied former new york city ballet principal future artistic director of the paris opera ballet seek after choreographer and husband of natalie portman
only one year old the l.a. dance project have already find international success and on tuesday night the troupe open the maison de la danse 's season fill every one of its 1,160 seat
no one could accuse mr. millepied of coast
as well as a recent piece of his own there be premiere from the city ballet dancer justin peck and by the israeli choreographer emanuel gat
it be a riveting rich evening of dance tightly pack with a range of movement style and influence superbly perform by the small ensemble aaron carr julia eichten charlie hodges morgan lugo nathan makolandra and rachelle rafailedes
mr. peck have make three much praise work for his home company in the last two year a fourth will have its premiere on thursday night at city ballet 's fall gala at lincoln center
as will a work by mr. millepied
you do not want to think about mr. peck 's travel schedule
murder ballad set to a quirky score of the same name by bryce dessner show what the fuss be about
it be mr. peck 's first piece for a contemporary dance ensemble and he make this immediately explicit as the curtain rise on a stage dot by sneaker
ms. eichten run on first and don her pair quickly follow by five more dancer in casual bright clothes
the mood be insouciant recall jerome robbins ballet like interplay and moves
later there be echo of west side story in the simultaneously approach and retreat line with which mr. peck end the third section and reminder of robbins 's dance at a gathering in the way social group form occasionally exclude then reabsorb a lone figure
there be other influence too william forsythe in the counterbalanced weighting of the partnering even pina bausch in a cumulatively urgent thrilling series of solo toward the end
but mr. peck 's own voice emerge clearly in his gift for structure and patterning in the dynamic contrast of the movement and in his ability to surprise both choreographically and psychologically
in the first minute of the piece dancer surround an immobile woman their palm hold up to but not touch her body as a man walk away light darken and a siren wail
murder
a late pas de deux end with a man drop his prone partner 's hand as the light fade
these moment of drama and inexplicable emotional current be mere hint mr. peck have the great gift of know how to subtract
mr. gat 's morgan 's last chug be a far less resolve work but it have its own gloomy allure a dark european nature set against the bright american vision of mr. peck 's piece
the dance unfold independently in flurry of rapid dislocated gesture against an aural backdrop of recording of purcell 's march from music for the funeral of queen mary glenn gould play bach 's suite franã§aise and jim norton in beckett 's krapp 's last tape
the structure of the work often feel arbitrary but mr. gat 's compositional layerings of body in space their apparently accidental refraction remain in the mind 's eye
so do mr. millepied 's reflection with its eye pop white letter on red backdrop stay and later go by barbara kruger in the artist 's signature graphic style
on the floor in the same color scheme be write think of you think of me
against this five dancer wear gray tone simple costume perform a series of duet solo and trio to a wide range piano score minimalist atonal melodic in turn by david lang
the movement be fleet and fluid reminiscent of mr. forsythe 's quintett in the way it both skim the floor yet be weight by gravity
two duet one adagio one allegro for ms. rafailedes and mr. makolandra be full of movement invention and beautifully dance more conventional but perfectly detailed be a sparkle balletic solo for the extraordinary mr. hodges who later move alongside mr. lugo both low to the ground in a duo of catlike stealth
reflection create in may be long 38 minute and can feel slightly desultory at moment
but what we see hearteningly in this and the other work on the program be man and woman in complex adult encounter
there be no central male female pas de deux that structural fallback of every neo classical ballet
life these choreographer suggest be more complicated and interesting than that
when the nine time emmy nominee and widely acknowledge dreamboat jon hamm sail down the red carpet on sunday chance be you will notice his date 's dress makeup and hairstyle more than the particular of his appearance
but mr. hamm will have have his hair carefully style to look loose than the tightly comb businessman 's coif for which he ' know on mad man
i work with jon when he ' jon hamm say his groomer diana schmidtke
i do not work with don draper
so for me it ' always about make him not look too don draper
almost like he just run his finger through his hair
very natural
though some man famous or not have be boldly step out with guyliner and nail polish we be not quite at the point where hollywood makeup artist be take credit for it as they do with woman
ms. schmidtke 38 be one of a handful of male celebrity groomers there a term little hear of 15 year ago when she say photographer would ask her what be that like dog grooming but increasingly bandied about in a world of high definition camera and metrosexuality
she have tend to the floppy forelock and five o'clock shadow of not just mr. hamm but clint eastwood george clooney jimmy fallon viggo mortensen and chris hemsworth make sure they look like the best version of themselves for magazine cover press junket and award show
this summer ms. schmidtke be in new mexico work on her first film the comedy a million ways to die in the west direct by and star seth macfarlane whom she start work with two year ago and groom for the academy awards in february
review of mr. macfarlane 's oscar host stint be mixed but thanks to the peter thomas roth anti shine gel ms. schmidtke smear on his t zone no one could say he be shiny
on a typical celebrity booking ms. schmidtke start with an old fashioned barber shave
next come the eyebrow a potential minefield
the quick way to feminize a man 's face be to over groom the eyebrow she say
you can do above the brow but when you start to take too much underneath or create any type of arch boom he start to look like a girl
she prefer pluck the brow to waxing which she say remove too much and also use tweezer to tackle stray nose and ear hair
then she apply concealer no pan cake please and mattifying lotion more guy friendly than powder puff she say as need
in fact ms. schmidtke be sensitive to all sort of macho preference
for example she will boil down beauty lingo into action word
pre shave oil may not register with guy but
if you say it help the glide of the blade ding ding ding they understand what it mean she say
within the industry ms. schmidtke be praise as much for her demeanor as for any specific ministration
i always trust that diana will make my client look and feel their best say robin baum a hollywood publicist who have work with mr. hemsworth johnny depp orlando bloom and james franco

she have great energy
the photographer mark seliger who have work with ms. schmidtke for 14 year on shoot for mr. macfarlane will ferrell and others praise ms. schmidtke 's fun and positivity
but the groomer characterize her rapport with a list actor another way
i 'm a little crass at time she say
ms. schmidtke become interested in hairdressing after model for nexxus at age 16 attend pivot point beauty school in chicago and move west in 1997 work for a pricey beverly hills salon
i be not use to that type of clientele she say
everything be so shiny and new the beautiful people and the car
i fail
but an apprenticeship with marvin lynch then a successful hairstylist lead to representation by the celestine agency she have since move to the wall group which book her on music shoot
i have every intention to do girl hair but it just would not click with actress ms. schmidtke say
in 1999 after an assign groomer do not show she be pull into a shoot with david boreanaz of angel
in thanks for the favor mr. boreanaz 's publicist next call on ms. schmidtke to groom chris klein for his american pie press tour
then all the mayhem start she say
i love it
i be young and my job be make hot guy hotter
she study the history of shaving and stay current by read man 's fashion and groom blog
though ms. schmidtke 's work sometimes involve the more traditional process of put a client into character as she do with mr. clooney for a cary grant style vanity fair shoot she also enjoy watch the application of television trend to real life the boardwalk empire shave close with an undercut while leave a floppy 4 to 5 inch on top be popular this summer she say
and while her work revolve around famous face ms. schmidtke be pleased to see company make more grooming solution for everyday jo
one of her career high point she say be in 2009 when she make over husband on the oprah winfrey show
but get a man even one who bank on his image to change his regimen be almost always an uphill battle ms. schmidtke say
with guy you have to keep it simple
the new york city ballet production of swan lake shape by the company 's artistic director peter martins in the 1990 be no simple experience
especially as perform on tuesday it keep tug its audience in different direction
the design by per kirkeby turn it into a pencil cartoon sketch of the swan lake show that ' then be daub by a paint by number beginner class the prince be all blue the villager be green the jester orange and so on
tchaikovsky 's tempo be take at a terrific lick no romantic lingering here
often the music andrews sill conduct the company 's orchestra on tuesday rush past without deepen the action yet in some central passage we 're sweep urgently into its vortex
the secondary character be tiresome
queen victoria complain of gladstone as prime minister
he speak to me as if i be a public meeting here however the queen gwyneth muller on tuesday in vast mime gesture that suggest she think he be a very public meeting indeed
the jester
daniel ulbricht though a prodigy of speed be completely unfunny
the evil sorcerer von rotbart silas farley who control the enchanted swan maiden and their queen odette be an absurd caricature devil the lining of his cloak the bright fabric of the whole show be hell flame orange
the dancing fall into two main category brisk efficient but flippantly inconsequential or brisk impetuous eloquent and compelling
fortunately sara mearns be rivetingly immediate as both the heroine odette and the look alike antiheroine odile
she dance the role as if live the story for the first time and as she burn her way through it you can not take your eye off her
as each phrase of her music arrive she ' already there on top of it as if it illustrate her rather than the reverse
in the first lakeside scene the corp of swan maiden dance that way too firm and highly three dimensional
while jared angle as prince siegfried dance in a simple style it ' elegant and full
the carriage of his head the focus of his address to other character the firmness of his phrase all give the drama real seriousness and he ' a superb partner
but when erica pereira brittany pollack and anthony huxley rattle their way nimbly through the step of the act i pas de trois an over embellish version of marius petipa 's 1895 st. petersburg version and when megan fairchild tiler peck abi stafford and joaquin de luz prattle through the top speed nonsense of mr. martins 's act ii palace pas de quatre it ' like hear gilbert sullivan patter song without the humor
only mr. huxley and especially mr. de luz manage to retain elegance the woman be make to look accomplished and silly at the same time
the waste of the phenomenal ms. peck in this taxing but trifling role be especially disgraceful yet hers be merely the bad case of mr. martins 's fondness for trivialize woman with obstacle course choreography
thus aspect of the swan lake story be turn inside out
in the traditional version the still part adolescent siegfried rebel against the constriction of grow up court decorum here mr. angle seem the only reasonable and three dimensional adult onstage until he meet ms. mearns by the lakeside
back in the palace his dreadful mother try to fob him off with a choice of six uniformly vapid but pushy princess when ms. mearns turn up this time in a black tutu his attraction to her seem entirely a meeting of serious mind amid a gathering of ninny
this really be not the fault of any dancer
city ballet 's performer on tuesday make the best case for this problematic production that i have experience their alertness of rhythm be a special pleasure
but most of what they 're dance be martins choreography which squander them
when the woman of the first court scene extend arm and one leg behind them in arabesque the image have no linear point
then when ms. mearns dance most of her choreography be by petipa lev ivanov and george balanchine the line of each outstretched limb know precisely which star in the firmament it will reach
simply inevitably her dancing show us the full amplitude of ballet and the art form again become something of great consequence
in the palace ballroom it be good to see a few dancer notably the ever improve savannah lowery in the hungarian dance bring real force to their material
as the heartbroken odette in the final scene ms. mearns even reveal value in mr. martins 's choreography
the vulnerability with which she return to fold over swan imagery as if return to her nest and the tragic poignancy with which she invest each phrase be both superb
still mr. martins wreck the start of this scene by give us irrelevant prank by the jester
and in the conclusion odette and siegfried defeat von rotbart without themselves meet death
but then odette still withdraw forever from siegfried because he break his vow to her
perhaps balanchine may have bring this off but he would have do so with a pierce image of dance drama
the astounding end of his divertimento from le baiser de la fee'â come to mind
mr. martins instead revert to mere romantic ballet formula with the corp screen odette 's exit and bar siegfried 's effort to pursue her
that be not this production 's only lame episode
the palace scene feature a foolish dance to the start of this ballet 's mazurka while siegfried plot his betrothal to the wrong heroine odile then clumsily the score cut to the last section of tchaikovsky 's action music
be it just stubbornness that make mr. martins keep revive his swan lake without try to improve its more obviously weak patch
he know well how balanchine go on rework ballet
and mr. martins 's dogged persistence in make no change to flawed production keep his whole company in a state of perpetually interrupt development

two year ago the swedish d.j. producer and denim model avicii release level a clangorous and joyful club anthem that be a global hit so vast that it reinforce the fact that the united states be not really the center of global pop at least not the way it once be
america have no real radio infrastructure for dance music which mean even a song like level have little hope of move beyond the electric daisy carnival circuit and into the broad pop consciousness although everywhere else that ' exactly where it reside
at least in this country american sonic imperialism still work
but a lot have change since levels
dance music be become normalized even here and have be seep into other genre from traditional pop to r&b. d.j.-producer like calvin harris by work with superstar like rihanna be begin to gain a dollop of the respect they garner elsewhere
into that environment arrive avicii 's full length debut album true prmd/island which thanks to the success of levels have the whiff of a fait accompli about it
at least it do until the ultra music festival in march when avicii turn his high profile set into a root jam session to the befuddlement of almost everyone and the outright anger of many
i be sure someone would have scream judas if they would get the joke
hey you get your bluegrass in my techno
be a perfectly valid complaint most of the time
and yes on a few song on true with the help of the bluegrass stalwart dan tyminski and the longtime country songwriter mac davis that be more or less what avicii attempt
but do not see true as the album in which dance music import the sound of the american heartland into the club in hope of dig up new audience or even new idea see it as the one in which country take its place front and center in global pop
that be the subtext of the guitar laden stomper wake me up already another huge hit that undermine american centrality in global pop and especially the unexpectedly lovely hey brother which feature the keen vocal of mr. tyminski
how much of a risk be it to use the main voice from an album the o brother where art thou
soundtrack that have sell over seven million copy in the united states
even though they 're unexpected twist in avicii 's otherwise clean ascent these song do not arrive in a vacuum
they sit comfortably next to the king size crossover country and folk of recent year think mumford sons or the dubstep song on the last taylor swift album
even keith urban have a fake club song on his new album
and that ' to say nothing of the emergent trend of club remixes of country hit by the like of dee jay silver and dj du. and yes there be disco country in the 1970 for what it ' worth
marry that to the recent impulse among a certain more classicist stripe of dance music act to bring the genre back to organic root daft punk 's last album repudiate the last couple of decade of computer music and avicii 's musical choice feel savvy and timely
along with the selection of his manager ash pournouri who receive a writing credit on almost every song on this album
that avicii be test himself and his public be clear
heart
upon my sleeve which feature vocal from dan reynolds of the alt rock preserver imagine dragons open up like an acoustic queensryche song
shame on me be swing music more or less and a less successful hybrid than avicii 's root experiment
compare with wake me up and hey brother the rest of true do not offer much challenge even if it be thoroughly effective in place
dear boy be completely straightforward electro infuse house and it ' sharp
lay me down produce in part by nile rodgers who be have a banner year and feature a brace vocal by adam lambert be completely valid modern disco faithful to the genre as it once be but not a slavish throwback
it ' another escape into yesteryear by an artist carry today and tomorrow on his shoulder

tom be the most autobiographical character in his canon so it become clear to me right away that as the point of entry the more i could learn about tennessee and understand what he be try to capture and the same time what he want to run away from the better off i would be he say
mr. quinto start with a biography by lyle leverich tom the unknown tennessee williams concentrate on the family dynamic depict in the play among the age mother and her two adult unmarried child
there be no shortage of work about the life of tennessee or work by tennessee or both he say with a laugh and a slight eye roll

and not surprisingly mr. quinto consider how sexuality inform the character he play
i think tom know that his relationship to alcohol and his constant seeking of adventure as he call it in the play belie a kind of desire that he be not able to fully embrace he say
after lunch john avina the general manager of the elysee take mr. quinto on a quick tour of the tennessee williams suite which be not the playwright 's old room but the apartment of the former owner of the property
there be play on the bookshelf photograph and a frame letter from williams to a friend who be to visit which give the name and address of the hotel
mr. quinto read aloud i 'll probably still be alone as my friend be have a vacation in veracruz mexico
he be attract to sinister place
the actor politely ask to see the room where the writer have spend his final day but be tell they be occupy
mr. avina hand him a card and say he would arrange for him to visit or stay on a night when the play be dark
thanks man mr. quinto say head to rehearsal
i 'll definitely be in touch
gothenburg sweden last month i lay in bed in sweden with my computer tune to the inaugural championship game of the national women 's soccer league
it be 2 a.m. and through sleepy eye i watch the starting lineup walk out in sahlen 's stadium in rochester
i could not help but reminisce about my last professional game in the united states play in that same stadium the 2011 championship game of women 's professional soccer
as the portland thorns celebrate the championship i watch on the screen from a different place literally across the world in europe and mentally than when i celebrate on that field in 2011 with the western new york flash
since then i have play for three different club one in russia a w league team in new jersey and now for kopparbergs/goteborg in sweden
all of a sudden the new american league seem foreign to me
as an outside observer the coverage of the n.w.s.l. have be excellent
the game have all be available for me to follow although i have only catch a handful because of the time difference
as much as i do know about the league i have realize there be a lot of area in which i be out of the loop
many of the player i know well and have play with over the year but there be also some unfamiliar face
since i play in the u.s. there be also two new franchise the thorns and the seattle reign
play in w.p.s. be my first professional experience so i do not have much with which to compare
now as a slightly more experienced professional my observation of the n.w.s.l. be influence by my feel for european woman 's soccer and how the game be grow globally in addition to in the u.s.
in sweden while there be fantastic support for the woman 's game there be a different emphasis on marketing and attendance
damallsvenskan the swedish woman 's league game have much small turnout than the number i be see in n.w.s.l. game report but for the most part the team here do not rely on ticket sale as a source of income
most club have a number of local and corporate sponsor who support the team regardless
hence the extreme number of logo on most swedish team uniform sometimes include one on the posterior of the short
i be hop to watch the n.w.s.l. sustain itself and flourish over the come year
play in europe have open my eye to how the plan need to be long term
team in sweden and in europe have gradually develop a culture style and system of play
it ' something i really appreciate about play abroad and hope to see take place in the u.s.
in sweden there be a promotion relegation system with a second league champions league spot to aim for and the swedish cup
every team have something to fight for regardless of its standing in the 12-team first division
this have take time to evolve but i would love to see professional woman 's soccer in the u.s. reach that point down the road
see the photo of the portland thorns celebrate their title take me back to 2011 but also take me forward in time with hope that the league will continue to provide playing opportunity for american canadian and mexican player and also begin to expand to attract player from elsewhere in the world
it be an impressive league with wonderful talent and dedicate fan
with my add perspective from play in europe i realize how much n.w.s.l. be truly in its infancy
as americans we always look to quickly make thing big better and more successful
like most invest follower and participant i think there should be some tweak make to the n.w.s.l. to continue to improve from season to season
after play elsewhere however and see that even the league with great history and parity be not perfect i have come to the conclusion that the n.w.s.l. 's opening season be a success
they be three of norman rockwell 's best know painting of homey small town america publish on the cover of
the saturday evening post say grace the gossips and walk to church
but the decision to auction them at sotheby 's in december will signify the end of a decade of unhomey legal squabbling among the heir of the art director who give rockwell his assignment from world war ii to the eve of the vietnam war

but shortly after his death william and jonathan sue their old brother ken jr. claim that he have take advantage of their ail father force him to sign paper to gain control of the fortune and contend that ken jr. have use estate asset for his own expense
only recently do the brother settle out of court
it ' be a long road say jonathan stuart the young brother in an interview
the value of the three painting be next to nothing when they be produce in the late 1940 and early 50 but mr. stuart now call them precious heirloom so precious in fact that he and his brother simply could no longer afford the insurance and upkeep
sotheby 's estimate that say grace on the cover of the nov. 24 1951 issue could bring at least $ 15 million to $ 20 million
the painting hang in kenneth j. stuart 's office at the saturday evening post and later in his family 's living room in wilton conn.
walk to church think to bring between $ 3 million to $ 5 million be in the bedroom of his wife katharine
dad never hang gossips,'â jonathan stuart say
none of us could figure out why
that painting be expect to fetch $ 6 million to $ 9 million
mr. stuart 67 who live in manhattan and own a record company recall that when he be a teenager his parent often leave him at the rockwell home in stockbridge mass. where the artist live from 1953 until his death in 1978
i wish i would know when i be hang out in his studio and he be teach me how to draw a horse how famous he would become mr. stuart say
i would have get him to sign one of his teaching sketch
he describe his father and rockwell as best friend
the elder kenneth stuart also create cover for the saturday evening post before become the magazine 's art director
as an artist ken stuart know how to talk to rockwell say elizabeth goldberg director of american art at sotheby 's

there ' a dining alcove off the kitchen in my one bedroom apartment
should i turn it into a second bedroom
a."when someone can see that the dining area can become a second bedroom it ' a plus for resale say mady faber an associate real estate broker with town residential in manhattan
for a grow family or a couple be able to buy a one bedroom that can be convert to a two bedroom mean they can stay there for many more year if they have a baby or need to work at home
the mere potential for this kind of conversion she add will generally make the apartment worth more money than a straight one bedroom that can not be convert
and move ahead with the conversion before list the property can make the home even more appealing
just make sure you really do have enough space she say because aesthetically if the living room be small and you cut off the dining area to create a second bedroom it may seem cramped
and that could turn off potential buyer
the kitchen should also have a separate entrance that be not through the new bedroom so the flow of space do not feel awkward
there be several other basic requirement the space must meet to be consider a true second bedroom say james ramsey owner of the new york design firm raad.
the first be adequate light and air he say mean the space need a window

and there ' a minimum dimension of eight foot that you need for the width of your bedroom he say
in his soho apartment mr. ramsey recently transform a dining nook into a bedroom for his year old son
it ' basically a room that ' calculate to be the minimum size you need for a twin size bed a crib and a set of dresser that you can change the baby on top of he say
mr. ramsey suggest that anyone consider this should first reverse engineer the room base on the furniture that will go in it to avoid a post construction surprise
if your space meet the minimum requirement a second bedroom can often be create with the addition of a single new wall
a permanent wall be one option mr. ramsey note but a pressurized wall a temporary partition that be not permanently fasten to structural member so it can be more easily remove in the future would also work
either way he recommend a pocket door rather than a swing door because it ' a space saver
and for a more elegant solution mr. ramsey suggest instal slide partition or glass door on track so the room can be open wide when not in use
that ' obviously a great expense he say
but it give you more light and the illusion of more space."â question about repair or redecorate before put a home on the market may be send to marketready@nytimes.com

in many bathroom the tub seem like an afterthought a soulless scoop of white enameled cast iron or acrylic
stephan jaklitsch think that ' a missed opportunity
a more interesting tub he say could make your bathroom feel a little more special and like a real retreat
mr. jaklitsch 45 be a principal of jaklitsch/gardner architects in new york with a number of international project include several marc jacobs store
when he travel abroad on business he often choose his hotel base on the bathtub
i 've be travel to place like japan norway and london he say where it ' not unusual to find tub design with long deep soaking session in mind
especially in cold wet climate there ' a history of culture use heated water to heat themselves
for a similarly appealing bathtub at home he suggest unexpected material like lightweight concrete wood zinc copper and carve stone
and if you want it to make a sculptural statement he say consider a free stand tub rather than a build in model
even though new york apartment be very small he say there ' this whole trend toward free stand bathtub
at af new york in the flatiron district mr. jaklitsch admire the ofuro larch wood soak tub by rapsel
i do like a wood tub because it echo the japanese onsen soak experience he say refer to the country 's hot spring
the wood be seal for easy maintenance he say and will feel soft and a little bit warm than many other tub
he also like the spoon xl by agape make from a material call cristalplant in a large egglike form
it have a very comfortable backrest he say
and even better it can accommodate two people
for a tub with a more traditional look he point out the kallista for town tub by michael s. smith at ann sacks
it ' a classic new york tub he say inspect the beefy rounded rim
i could see it in a historic town house
and the 20-inch depth he add be a luxury
at simon 's hardware and bath he find a boxy tub call cube from wetstyle
it would work free stand or in an alcove he say in a space challenge bathroom or against a wall of glass

so what kind of tub do mr. jaklitsch choose for the bathroom in his west village home
i have a 1930s cast iron tub that ' extra long that come with the apartment he say
i renovate the bathroom but keep the tub."â

paris face grow fear of hypersexual young girl the french upper house of parliament vote wednesday to end beauty pageant for those young than 16
the senate pass the new ban 197-to-146 as an amendment to a large bill aim at increase gender equality
the measure now go to the low house the national assembly for discussion and a vote
pageant be popular in small town across france though far less frequent and less intense than in the united states
and france have no equivalent of american reality show like toddlers tiaras and its spinoff
here come honey boo boo that feature very young contestant
still the intense focus on beauty here combine with a surge of image of sexualize prepubescent girl have raise fear that the pageant could take on the over the top quality of american contest
it be extremely destructive for a girl between the age of 6 and 12 to hear her mother say that what ' important for her be to be beautiful chantal jouanno the ban 's champion say wednesday
we be fight to say what count be what they have in their brain
ms. jouanno a former junior minister for environment and a senator represent paris from the center right party u.d.i. write a report on the hypersexualization of child in 2011
the report be commission by the health minister in response to public outrage over a photo display in paris vogue that feature under age girl in sexy clothes and posture with high heel makeup and paint fingernail
the episode draw attention to the increase use of very young girl in fashion photography and advertisement
france have a number of contest that parent can enroll their child in online
two mini miss and graines de miss miss in the making have annual beauty pageant of more than 20 contestant age 6 to 13 in various city
the french pageant do have some sense of restraint
some prohibit bathing suit competition and advertise the contest with photo of little girl dress up more like fairy tale princess than as youthful femmes fatales
the 2011 winner of mini miss oceane scharre appear in a white gown but with her crown askew and little obvious makeup
however her long sparkle earring seem rather too large for the slender little girl
opponent protest that the penalty be too severe up to two year in prison and a $ 40,000 fine for anyone who help encourage or tolerate child 's participation in the contest
some pageant organizer say they be frustrate by the suggestion that they be corrupt girl
maud chevalier who start graines de miss in 2001 bar young candidate from wear heel over 1.4 inch high short dress wig makeup and swimsuit
i want to organize a contest which respect the child mrs. chevalier say in an interview
she say the ban show how misinformed people be about beauty contest
they look at beauty contest on tv and in the u.s. where contest be not adapt to child she say
they think that child parade on a stage to look like a barbie
her own interpretation be quite different
children fight against stage fright by wear a princess dress she say
in our contest she also say girl be princess for a day they make friend with others

the recent agreement between the united states and russia on syria 's chemical weapon make clear what should have be obvious long ago president obama 's effort to uphold international norm against weapon of mass destruction in the middle east will entangle the united states in a diplomatic and strategic maze that be about much more than syria 's chemical arsenal
president bashar al assad of syria insist that the purpose of his chemical arsenal be always to deter israel 's nuclear weapon
if syria actually disarm what about egypt and israel
egypt about whose chemical weapon the united states have be strangely silent point to israel
and israel of course have its own chemical weapon to deter syria 's and egypt 's and it be not about to give them up
a headline in the israeli daily haaretz a few day ago state israel adamant it wo not ratify chemical arm treaty before hostile neighbor
these three country have not adhere to the biological weapons convention either
and israel be not a member of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty despite have develop a formidable nuclear arsenal of its own which will soon become the central fact in this drama whether the united states like it or not
an obstacle of america 's own making have long prevent comprehensive negotiation over weapon of mass destruction in the middle east
while the world endlessly discuss iran 's nuclear capability and the likelihood that it will succeed in develop an atomic arsenal hardly anyone in the united states ever mention israel 's nuclear weapon
mr. obama like his predecessor pretend that he do not know anything about them
this taboo impede discussion within washington and internationally
it have keep america from press egypt and syria to ratify the chemical and biological weapon convention
do so would have bring immediate objection about american acceptance of israel 's nuclear weapon
what sustain this pretense be the myth that america be lock into cover up israeli nuclear bomb because of a 1969 agreement between president richard m. nixon and israel 's prime minister golda meir
for mr. nixon it be mainly about gain israeli support in the cold war
he and mrs. meir understand the need to discourage the soviets from provide their arab allies with nuclear weapon
a declare israeli nuclear arsenal would have lead to pressure for moscow to do so
but such cold war reason for america to stay mum evaporate decade ago
everyone know the israelis have nuclear bomb
today the main effect of the ambiguity be to prevent serious regional arm control negotiation
all other country in the region be member of the nonproliferation treaty but there be still unresolved issue
syria be catch build an illicit nuclear reactor in 2007 which israel swiftly bomb
mr. assad still have not allow international inspector to fully investigate that obliterated reactor site
and syria 's ally iran be suspect of try to assemble its own weapon program to challenge israel 's nuclear monopoly
indeed many analyst believe that mr. obama 's decision to issue a red line bar the use of chemical weapon in syria be in fact drive by the perceive need to demonstrate that he be prepared to use force against iran if it move further toward nuclear weapon
this witch brew be suppose to become the subject of an international conference mandate in 2010 by the unanimous vote of the member of the nonproliferation treaty include the united states
but that conference have not happen in part because of white house ambivalence about how it may affect israel
in april the american assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation thomas m. countryman express hope that the conference would be hold by this fall
and earlier this month russia 's foreign minister sergey v. lavrov urge all party to set a conference date as quickly as possible
he also argue that it should include israel and iran
russia attempt to include the conference in last week 's agreement but secretary of state john kerry resist

neal schwartz a san francisco architect be eager to share what he have learn about how to get the look for less
want a sleek minimalist kitchen
he recommend put in a glass backsplash and instal open shelving instead of upper cabinet
if you 're consider a poured concrete floor he suggest add a small amount what amount to few penny worth of a pigment know as lampblack to make it a chic dark gray instead of use expensive color concrete
and as an architect he be always look for way to enhance a home 's sense of expansiveness
you can use all the thing on hand that be free the light the view to add value to whatever financial resource you bring he say
mr. schwartz who teach at the california college of the arts and own a firm call schwartz and architecture be use to counsel anxious city dweller try to squeeze more room out of small house
but after watch several client get in a knot over whether to go with prefabricated or custom construction he design a house of his own to prove a point that custom design do not have to cost much more and it have all the advantage that come from a bespoke fit
i just want to push back against the idea that prefab be the only way to get good design at a good price he say and that custom mean fancy
mr. schwartz envision the low slung two bedroom two bath structure which he call hydeaway house as a weekend retreat for himself his spouse ron flynn and their two spinone italianos florence and aldo
but with the idea that he and mr. flynn would eventually retire there they be both 51 he also design it with handicapped accessibility in mind
the total cost of the 2,000-square foot home be $ 720,000 or $ 360 a square foot
that ' not cheap but neither be high quality prefabricated construction which can cost nearly as much per square foot
and high end residential construction in the area be even costly typically about $ 450 a square foot not include cost like permit and engineering and design fee
the big strategy to save money be to create a really efficient floor plan that put the space where it ' go to be feel the most mr. schwartz say
i see so many home where space just seem to be waste
accordingly the l shape layout he create with the kitchen and living area in the center and identical bedroom suite on either end wrap around one corner of the site maximize open space on the one acre lot and block out view of the neighbor
from the outside the house be unassuming clothe in inexpensive cedar side
but pass through the front door be like open a clothbound book and see full color illustration inside
expanse of glass which mr. schwartz do not stint on take in the view endless line of grapevine frame by gnarled california valley oak
and visual trick like exterior wall of glass in the shower and window precisely position to look onto particular view help foster the impression of endless space
to furnish the house mr. schwartz seek out piece that would be interesting and durable but at a comfortable price
i start at room board to figure out what i want because they have pretty nice stuff he say
and then look for how to get it some other way
the coffee table he make from slice of white cypress with caster so they could be easily move
the light fixture in the living room be base on d.i.y. plan supply by lindsey adelman the brooklyn lighting designer and make with inexpensive part from the hardware store
and in an effort to get some art up quickly mr. schwartz take an x acto knife to a book of bird photograph by andrew zuckerman
the bathroom sconce from schoolhouse electric be tricky
i have a few false start mr. schwartz say
i 'd open the box and ron would say what be you thinking?'â he add a little ruefully i be try to save money
those who remember donny osmond singing you be my sunshine on the andy williams show in 1963 have probably become so inured to life 's little curve ball that they wo not be surprised to learn that the popular entertainer now 55 and a grandfather several time over be about to release a housewares collection with his wife debbie

q. last month you blogged about a recent operation
how be you
a. i know that would be the first question
it ' a real bummer let 's put it that way
as marie say on stage i break my butt
i tear the tendon from the gluteus medius muscle right off the bone as i be dance but i finish the show in that condition
i imagine you have find housewares easy on the muscle but still i wonder what make you veer into design
this be something that be more organic than one would imagine
for 35 year now debbie and i have be marry and she ' always create this wonderful atmosphere at home for me because my world as you can imagine be crazy with the touring and travel
now that we 're get old it ' something she and i can do for the rest of our life together
because you know the term family be pretty synonymous with the term osmond
how would you describe the collection
i wish debbie be on the phone too
there ' go to be i be lean these different type of phraseology because it ' such a new business to me but it ' more of a transitional style if that make any sense
it ' kind of eclectic with a kind of a modern flair
the same way as i have handle my career for 50 year you have to learn to adapt and change
we 're tell by our marketing team that honeycomb and the color gray be trend right now so debbie and i these last couple of day have sit with our design team through the computer
we approve certain style and it ' perfectly in line with what she and i like
i catch glimpse of your utah home in an interview you do some year ago with kathie lee gifford
it seem comfortable and traditional
would you say that sum up the style of donny osmond home
keep in mind that ' the only time we have ever open up our home for an interview and probably the last
we maintain that our home be very private even though we 're open up our style
i think a very comfortable very homey atmosphere be a nice guideline
but there may be something a little more elegant or a little more transitional
it really depend on the taste of the buyer
have partner for many decade with your sister what be it like to work with your wife
be this your first partnership
yes it ' the first
no
for 35 year she ' be my partner
what do each of you bring to the table
i bring the support
she ' get the eye for this
what ' really interesting over the year our taste have actually become one
i remember when we first get marry in 1978 i be more modern and she be more traditional
but in 1978 the style be so different so you 're constantly evolve
that ' what we want to bring to the public all different kind of thing available at different price
a lot of people can afford these thing
each phase in your career have bring a different relationship to your audience
who do you hope to connect to with this collection
fantastic question
let me tell you a story i look out at the audience every night in vegas
right after i win dance with the stars there be a little 10-year old kid who have watch every week
he be dress in this suit and he have a tie on and he be with his mom and dad
he be watch me intently through the entire show
afterward we do a meet and greet
i saw this little kid in line and the closer he get the more excited he get
he come up and shake my hand
he say
mr. osmond i do not know you could sing too
here ' another little story
last year i have a meeting over at one of the hotel here in vegas
as i be come up to give them my car in the parking structure i hear the song i do for the disney movie mulan
i follow the sound and come to a van and all these u.c.l.a. student be in there half asleep because they be up all night either gambling or partying
they be on their way back to l.a. i knock on the window and the driver roll down the window and turn the music down
he say can i help you
i say that song you 're listen to
that ' me
he say be you donny osmond
this be our theme song when we have test and exam
it start out let 's get down to business
so now i have get fan that be 10-year old college student parent and grandparent
so here ' the answer to your question
i do not know
how do you appeal to that wide a demographic
you have get to be eclectic
you have get to be broad base
you 're probably short on time but i have another story
do please tell it
last night at the meet and greet this lady come up to me and she say my 5-year old daughter listen to you all the time
i say oh that ' so sweet
she say she keep ask for anaconda anaconda
and we finally realize she be ask for and they call it puppy love
now i have get a 5-year old fan
what be your home like grow up
which hotel would you really like to refer to
i be always on the road
but seriously my home when we do come home from a tour be a big spanish house in san fernando valley calif.
it be not elegant it be not a mansion
we do not drive fancy car
that ' one thing my father and mother teach us live within your mean
if you have mean do not flaunt it
in your book life be just what you make it you say that at a low career point you think of toss it all in and start a home security business
why home security
yeah it be 1988 and just before soldier of love hit in 1989 and i have try so hard to get back out on the chart and could not do it even with peter gabriel 's help
the reason i like home security be because i be always interested in electronics
i do not think it have anything to do with my own security
i be just an electronics geek
i have pretty much lose everything in the early 1980 and i have to rebuild
in 1988 i have three child and i think how be i go to support a family
that be an alternative and thank goodness it do not go that way
if you could relive any decade of your life which would it be
well i have get to be honest
the 70s be amazing even through the purple sock and the puppy love
yeah i enjoy it
but i wish i enjoy it a little bit more
i be read a great book call the power of now
i be learn how to enjoy the moment
but i have to be honest i be enjoy this moment more than any in my life because i really do not have to prove anything anymore
i be never go to be in coast mode
i be always go to be climb some kind of mountain
but it ' such an enjoyable time in my life with my wife and kid and grandbabies
and we 're try to open up that joy we have have in our home and make it accessible to other people
that ' the message create an atmosphere of love and peace and refuel at home

mendocino county calif. twenty year after they embark on an experiment in communal living the member of cheesecake gather for an anniversary celebration over labor day weekend
nearly 100 people the seven who live here full time six who be here part time and assorted child grandchild and friend include laura hartman one of the architect who design the complex spend two day barbecue talk hike through the redwood and compete to see who could bake the best cheesecake
the competition be in honor of the community 's name which be derive from a loose translation of casada the surname of the family who own the 20-acre property at the turn of the 19th century
the young and more adventurous among them sleep in tent or tepee in the meadow ms. hartman bring her own pup tent while old visitor bunk together in the residential building or stay in hotel nearby
it be a fittingly multigenerational celebration for an idea inspire by the parent of some of the original member who become increasingly isolated with age no one should have to grow old alone
in 1994 the new york times report on how those member or partner as they call themselves have settle into their first year of life as a community retirement
for 11 friend it ' off to camp
it be one of a number of such experiment know as cohousing community that be spring up around the country at the time base on a danish model develop in the 1960
the original group of 11 include four married couple and three woman all in their 50 and 60 each of whom agree to pay a monthly fee for the mortgage tax and insurance on the 6,000-square foot complex as well as a small daily usage charge for utility whenever they be in residence food and phone bill be handle individually
bedroom and some bathroom be private but nearly everything else be share an arrangement that seem feasible give the longstanding friendship of most of the member who have start a cooperative nursery school for their child when they live in southern california in the 1960
still there be three building in the complex two that contain common area and private apartment and one where resident could pursue their hobby because as ms. hartman say in the 1994 article everyone under one roof make people nervous
how do the experiment turn out
on the 20th anniversary the consensus be generally positive
as helen papke 84 observe it have be a lesson in patience
when it ' good it ' so good she say
and when it ' bad it ' so bad the angst and argument we have with each other
but we have a conviction to work it out and we will
dick browning 78 whose wife louise die in 2007 be more effusive
i love it he say
i love the community
of the original 11 member seven be still here although apart from ms. browning no one have die
one couple and one woman leave for personal reason
the community have take on new member so there be now 13 altogether
no one seem lonely but some of the resident be not quite as energetic as they once be
take daniel myers a retire lawyer who move in with his wife jill in 1993 when he be 60
now he say i can not get on the roof to get the leaf off and i can not chop wood
and needless to say there have be plenty of compromise along the way
even something as simple as cut down a tree or buy a new dishwasher require a consensus or at least the agreement of three quarter of the resident
and get that many people to agree on anything can take a while
ask sophie otis a clinical psychologist who be now 77 who have to lobby for almost two decade to get rid of the tree obstruct the view from her window
in 1993 when she move in it be only six foot tall and she could see around it
ten year later at 30 foot it be start to block the light
but it be not until january when it be 45 foot tall and threaten to fall down that the community agree to remove it ms. otis say
they finally cut it down this year not because of my problem with the view she say but because it be block the light and be a hazard in lot of way

in some respect 1988 have the feel of an alien distant era
there be no such thing as the world wide web then
the soviet union be still around the berlin wall still stand
americans elect a republican president who would raise tax to help tame the budget deficit
on tuesday however the census bureau remind me how for most americans 1988 still look a lot like yesterday last year the typical household make $ 51,017 roughly the same as the typical household make a quarter of a century ago
the statistic be staggering hardly what one would expect from one of the rich and most technologically advanced nation on the planet
i have write several time before about how measure of social and economic well being in the united states have slip compare to other advanced country
but it be even more poignant to recognize that in many way america have be stand still for a full generation
it make me wonder what happen to progress
consider 36 year ago this month when nasa launch the voyager 1 probe into space 11.6 percent of americans be officially consider poor
the other day voyager sail clear out of the solar system into interstellar space the first man make object to do so record its environment on an 8-track deck
use the same official metric which actually undercounts the poor compare to new method use by the census today the poverty rate be 15 percent
to be sure we have make progress over the last 25 year
the nation 's gross domestic product per person have increase 40 percent since 1988
we have gain four year worth of life expectancy at birth
the infant mortality rate have plummet by 50 percent
more woman and more man be enter and graduate from college
we also have access to far more sophisticated consumer good from the iphone to car pack with digital device
and the cost of many basic staple notably food have fall significantly
carl shapiro an economist at the university of california berkeley and an expert on technology and innovation who step down from president obama 's council on economic advisors last year call the progress in information technology and biotechnology over the last 25 year breathtaking
most americans partake in the benefit offer by these new technology from smartphones to better dental care professor shapiro say
still he acknowledge somehow this impressive progress have not translate into great economic security for the american middle class
in key respect in fact the standard of living of most americans have fall decidedly behind
just take the cost of medical service
health care spend per person adjust for inflation have roughly double since 1988 to about $ 8,500 push up health insurance premium and eat into worker wage
the cost of go to college have be rise faster than inflation as well
about two third of people with bachelor 's degree rely on loan to get through college up from 45 percent two decade ago
average student debt in 2011 be $ 23,300
in contrast to people in other developed nation who have devote more time to leisure as they have get rich americans work about as much as they do a quarter century ago
despite all this toil the net worth of the typical american family in the middle of the income distribution fall to $ 66,000 in 2010 6 percent less than in 1989 after inflation
though the bursting of the housing bubble and ensue great recession take a big share of the blame for family weakening finance it be nonetheless startle that a single financial event only a hiccup on the road to prosperity of americans on the top of the pile could erase a generation worth of progress for those in the middle
though the statistic may be startle the story they tell be unfortunately not surprising
it be the story of america 's new normal
in the new normal the share of the nation 's income channel to corporate profit be high than at any time since the 1920s while worker share languishes at its low since 1965
in the new normal the real wage of worker on the factory floor be low than they be in the early 70
and the rich 10 percent of americans get over half of the income america produce
almost all of the benefit of growth since the trough of the great recession have be go to those in the upper class say timothy smeeding who head the institute for research on poverty at the university of madison wisconsin

middle- and low income family be get a small slice of a small economic pie as labor market have change drastically during our recovery
this story be about three decade old
in 2010 the department of commerce publish a study about what it would take for different type of family to achieve the aspiration of the middle class which it define as a house a car or two in the garage a vacation now and then decent health care and enough saving to retire and contribute to the child 's college education
it conclude that the middle class have become a much more exclusive club
even two earner family make almost $ 81,000 in 2008 substantially more than the family median of about $ 60,000 report by the census would have a much tough time acquire the attribute of the middle class than in 1990
the income of these type of family actually rise by a fifth between 1990 and 2008 accord to the report
they be more educate and work more hour on average and have child at a late age
still that be no match for the 56 percent jump in the cost of housing the 155 percent leap in out of pocket spending on health care and the double digit increase in the cost of college
so either we define the middle class down a couple of notch or we acknowledge that the middle class be not in the middle anymore

rio de janeiro brazil 's high court on wednesday allow a new round of appeal in a trial over a vast vote buy scheme a decision that may allow senior political figure in the rule workers party to maneuver out of hard jail time for their action in what may be brazil 's big corruption scandal
end month of suspense after defendant be find guilty and sentence to prison by the same court in november 2012 in what have be celebrate then as a watershed moment the justice rule by 6 5 to reopen crucial aspect of the trial
so far no one have go to prison in the scandal which emerge in 2005
the move set a troubling precedent by raise concern over a domino effect in many other corruption case involve powerful figure say ivar hartmann a professor of law at fundaã§ã£o getãºlio vargas a top brazilian university
even before the trial it be remarkably rare for politician in brazil to go to prison after be find guilty of crime like corruption kidnapping and employ slave labor partly because of the special judicial standing enjoy by about 700 political figure include senior cabinet minister and all 594 member of congress
this standing require their case to be hear only in the high court which be already bogged down by thousand of other case each year
the system produce year of delay in judge politician charge with serious crime
legal expert say such case could now drag on indefinitely after a ruling by the high court justice on wednesday which allow appeal of their own vote in these trial
the televise debate over the appeal within the court the supreme federal tribunal produce heated moment in recent week
justice gilmar mendes say the court be invite mockery as a juvenile tribunal of irresponsible people while another justice ricardo lewandowski argue that the court be merely give defendant the right to a new appeal
give the delay that have already characterize the trial the court 's discussion of the appeal could realistically drag on for year helenita acioli the interim prosecutor general say this month
that may benefit figure like jose dirceu de oliveira e silva who be chief of staff for brazil 's former president luiz inã¡cio lula da silva and sentence to nearly 11 year in prison for his role in orchestrate the vote buy scheme call the mensalã£o or big monthly allowance after the regular payment make to legislator in exchange for their vote
the appeal involve a rare legal procedure in which close vote on the high court can be hold again
the appeal which be think to have originate in the 16th century legal system of portugal brazil 's former colonial ruler be abolish there in the 1930
few brazilians have even hear of the appeal until the high court consider them in the mensalã£o trial
while few conviction be expect to be overturn defendant be seek less stringent prison condition include arrangement that allow convict to leave prison during the day to work
some legal expert hold open the possibility that some defendant could avoid jail time altogether if the trial endure long crime commit about a decade ago could be exceed by the statute of limitation
the stain on their reputation remain say matthew m. taylor a scholar at american university in washington who specialize in brazil 's legal system
he say the late twist in their trial be more troubling for what it say about brazil 's court and their inability to effectively and expeditiously tackle widespread corruption within the political system
it use to be that if you could not afford to pay a big medical bill your doctor or hospital may let you pay it over time a little bit each month
the holston medical group for instance a large multispecialty physician group in tennessee have one plan with such low payment that it would have take the patient 115 year to pay a bill off
but the day of such informal arrangement may be number
you can still find installment plan but now they be often more structured agreement manage by a company hire to oversee your account
hospital say they be turn to such business because as insurance plan shift more cost to patient provider be stuck try to collect money they be owe
hospital provide about $ 41 billion in uncompensated care in 2011 accord to the american hospital association
some hospital have even come under fire for heavy handed practice like put representative of collection agency in emergency room to get patient to pay up front
enter service like carepayment and clearbalance which promote no interest payment plan to hospital and patient as flexible and patient friendly
hospital be very sensitive to the fact that out of pocket cost for patient be increase drastically say craig froude chief executive of carepayment
they 're try to figure out how to adapt
detail vary depend on the term negotiate between the hospital and the payment company
in some case hospital offer the plan as an option
other hospital automatically enroll patient who do not pay a bill within 90 day
typically the company offer plan of as long as two year and sometimes as long as five year with no interest or fee for patient
payment be usually base on a percentage of the total bill with minimum around $ 25 a month
the hospital pay a fee to the company in exchange for get its payment up front
the company then collect the payment
some offer automatic deduction and let patient check their account online
the benefit be that hospital may get more of the money they be owe than they would otherwise even after factor in fee to the outside company
the patient get time to pay a big bill and avoid the damage to a credit record that would occur if the debt be send to collection
that can still happen
if the patient do not pay the company send the account back to the hospital for review
a patient who use such a plan may receive a card bear the name of the hospital and the payment firm but it be not a credit card
the company say they may conduct a soft inquiry on a patient 's credit report which do not affect the credit score
a patient whose score fall below a certain level will still be put on a plan but the company will not pay the hospital until the patient have make a few payment on time
a patient 's payment record generally be not report to credit bureau
mitch patridge chief executive of csi financial services which be base in san diego and offer clearbalance say it give patient the option of have their payment history report to credit bureau if they choose to help build credit
jeff costello chief financial officer at beacon health system in south bend ind. say it have try offer short term payment plan and even low interest loan through a local bank but patient do not like pay interest for medical bill
the system begin use carepayment 's no interest plan in 2009 and it have be well receive by patient he say some who use it once ask for it up front when seek additional care
patient can add new bill to the account he say and have their monthly payment recalculate
here be question to ask about medical installment plan â
will i have to pay interest if i do not pay off the bill by a certain date
some provider include dentist and eye care outlet offer true credit card financing
they may offer zero percent rate but the rate can skyrocket if you be late or stop pay
hospital say their plan be different and offer no or in some case very low interest
but make sure you understand the detail of any plan you accept and get a copy of the agreement in writing so you know what happen if you can not pay
â
can i still get financial assistance if i agree to a payment plan
you should always ask first about financial help to reduce your overall bill say mark rukavina a specialist on medical debt
under the affordable care act nonprofit hospital will have to develop write policy on their charity care and collection practice
many for profit hospital have write policy too
you should ask
â should i use a no interest plan even if i can pay in full
some provider offer significant discount if you pay in full within 30 day
if you can do so that may be a better option

carnival cruise lines be introduce a new advertising campaign on monday that it hop will help it recover from the negative publicity it receive when its ship the triumph catch fire last february and strand passenger and crew in the gulf of mexico
the cruise line have not run any television advertising and only limit digital advertising since the fire which strand 4,200 passenger and crew member for five day and become a cause celebrã¨ in the medium
in 2010 another of the line 's 24 ship the splendor also catch fire at sea
robin farley who follow the cruise industry for ubs say carnival cruise lines historically have be one of the strong brand in the cruise sector
she estimate that the line one of 10 operate by the carnival corporation represent 30 percent of its parent company 's total capacity and that before the triumph accident generate more than 30 percent of its profit
she also say the accident could lead to yield decline of 10 to 11 percent for the line this year
in recent year advertising by carnival create by the boston office of arnold worldwide part of havas have focus on the fun aspect of its cruise
the tagline on some tv spot be fun for all all for fun
the new advertising follow a series of action undertake by the line after the triumph accident include a $ 300 million program to upgrade emergency power capability fire safety technology and other system outreach to travel agent an important source of business and a vacation guarantee program that give dissatisfied passenger a 110 percent refund
jim berra chief marketing officer for carnival say additional innovation in dining entertainment and program for young passenger will be introduce start this fall
once the brand perception take a hit post triumph we feel the strong and most credible voice to convey what a cruise experience be truly like be the voice of the guest mr. berra say
thus in july the line invite 10 people who be active on instagram interested in food and family issue among other topic to take a cruise during which they could shoot photo
these be post live on a web site carnival.com/momenttracker
in july the line also ask former passenger and employee to submit photo and video via facebook and instagram they have take on carnival cruise it receive more than 31,000 piece of this content
more than 500 video and photo include some by the instagram activist who sail in july be feature in a new tv spot which show individual walk down a street in a field and along a boardwalk
all place where they walk be festoon with picture frame which contain the user generate imagery
the voice over say we never forget the moment that matter
we hang them on our wall
we share them with everyone
and hold onto them forever
the spot end with an image of a carnival cruise ship at sea and the voice over concluding since the day we first set sail million of last moment have be make with us
what will yours be
a 60-second version of the tv spot will begin run monday on prime time network television show like how i meet your mother and parks and recreation as well as on cable channel like bravo tlc and the food network
digital and radio advertising with the same theme as the tv spot will also be create
pete johnson co executive creative director of the boston office of arnold worldwide say the new campaign 's theme be choose because we want to have a more emotive message to let viewer see carnival as a place where they can experience deep moment with family friend and love one
we want to tell the story from cruiser point of view to be as authentic as possible
mr. berra say the campaign be aim at outgoing engage optimistic individual as well as at decision make mom
the timing of it be not coincidental mr. berra say the campaign be design to accelerate recovery in advance of the wave season in the first quarter of 2014 the first quarter of the calendar year when carnival typically receive approximately 30 percent of its annual booking
mr. berra say carnival would spend more than $ 25 million on advertising in the fourth quarter of 2013 some of which will be money the line do not spend when it suspend tv advertising after the triumph accident
accord to kantar media carnival annually have spend from $ 26.9 million on advertising in 2012 to $ 71.3 million in 2010
ms. farley say it make sense that carnival use social medium to create its new advertising since comment on social medium by strand triumph passenger magnify the experience of a few in a way that overshadow what the brand stand for such a long time
other travel and marketing expert be highly critical of the campaign
john greening a professor of branding and marketing communication at the medill school of journalism at northwestern university say the campaign be premature
carnival need to let more time go by
it ' too soon to be promote itself
they may do more p.r. effort than advertising he say

the penske media corporation she contend have not deliver promise resource an assertion that a penske spokeswoman call patently not true
for mr. penske and the broad business community the tit for tat entanglement may simply boil down to another example of the corporate difficulty associate with brand that be so closely link to one personality especially one as ferocious as ms. finke
most people in hollywood be focus on more pressing matter than internal squabbling at a trade publication
but at least in some corner of the show business capital the finke penske fight have turn into a lurid spectator sport

deadline have 2.6 million a 9 percent increase from a year earlier
ms. finke cite high internal number for deadline
for now ms. finke insist that she be eager to put the conflict behind her and return her focus to her colorful writing and reporting

philadelphia in august 2005 my son alec then 39 year old collapse into unconsciousness while walk his dog in the suburb of philadelphia
by the time he arrive at the hospital his heart rate have slow to 30 beat per minute
fortunately an experienced physician recognize that alec be have a cardiac complication of lyme infection
installation of a pacemaker and an infusion of antibiotic save his life
each year there be more than 30,000 case of lyme disease report to the centers for disease control and prevention
but last month the c.d.c. announce that the real number of annual infection be close to 300,000
alec have one of the most serious consequence of a lyme infection but the microbe can also lead to neurological illness like meningitis and encephalitis and more commonly fatigue arthritis and rash
but the symptom can be hard to spot
indeed day before he become gravely ill alec consult a physician because of a rash but because it do not appear in a bull' eye shape lyme disease be not suspect
it be a common misconception that the lyme disease rash always appear this way
the tick that carry lyme disease which be prevalent in the northeast united states the upper midwest and northern california as well as in central europe and scandinavia can be hard to spot too
both nymph and adult tick can transmit the bacteria but the tiny nymph which emerge in the springtime be hard to see with the naked eye until they mature in the fall
in other word it ' easy to be bite and not realize it
if you be infect it ' easy for a doctor to miss the symptom
should not there be a vaccine for such a prevalent and dangerous disease
in fact we use to have one and be perfectly capable of produce another if the public demand be high and we avoid the mistake of the past
in 1998 smithkline beecham now glaxosmithkline develop a vaccine that be about 80 percent effective for at least a year after three dos
but the advisory committee on immunization practices which counsel the c.d.c. on vaccine use be lukewarm about the real benefit and necessity of it
the committee make a weak recommendation to consider vaccination for high risk person overlook the fact that plenty of casual gardener and hiker be be infect
instead the committee emphasize the use of protective clothing and insect repellent despite little evidence that those measure prevent tick bite and even less evidence that people will constantly use them
nevertheless the vaccine be put on the market and physician have to decide what to do with the ambiguous recommendation
then the manufacturer make a strategic error of its own decide to directly advertise the vaccination to the public despite the fact that by and large people rely on their doctor recommendation to decide whether to receive a vaccine
in addition the manufacturer put the vaccine on the market before it have be test in child so it could be prescribe only to adult
but the big blow to the marketing campaign come from a group of volunteer who have be involve in the vaccine 's prelicensure study and who report develop arthritic symptom after the vaccination
although the rate of arthritis in the vaccinated volunteer be the same as the rate in the control group some lyme disease activist conclude that the vaccine cause rather than prevent lyme disease
in 1999 a class action suit be bring against the manufacturer
retrospective study have show no connection between the vaccination and arthritis but at the time sale of the vaccine drop precipitously and in 2002 the manufacturer withdraw it from the market
of course lyme disease do not go away
the tick that carry the lyme bacteria be spread to new area
and though early antibiotic treatment can kill the lyme bacteria the diagnosis be frequently miss at the beginning of the disease as in my son 's case
we need to prevent people from get lyme disease in the first place
the experience of glaxo have unfortunately frightened other company away from pursue this need vaccine
i be a consultant to most of the major vaccine manufacturer though i have no financial interest in the development of a lyme vaccine and i have long be argue for a return to this area
despite the manufacturer reluctance scientific study have continue and experimental vaccine against lyme infection be available for further development
if manufacturer think there be a market for them they will work to obtain a license from the food and drug administration but first they must be convince that the fiasco of the first vaccine will not be repeat
physician and patient should write to the c.d.c. to remind them of high public demand
it be likely that a new vaccine would now be recommend for all those who work or play outdoors in the area where lyme bearing tick be common a large part of the population of the united states
until then americans can vaccinate their dog against lyme disease but have no such option for themselves
stanley a. plotkin be a professor of pediatrics at the university of pennsylvania
the dreadful monotony and morbidity of the gun control discussion in this country have leave me dispirited
another mass shooting
another round of shock sadness and outrage
another pitch discussion about right and responsibility mental illness and background check
and then nothing
the pundit debate merit
the public demand action
but in the end n.r.a. intimidation pressure the coward in congress to maintain the status quo and scare ordinary citizen into believe that they face extraordinary threat from the burglar out to steal property to a government out to rob them of their gun and the second amendment
as president obama tell telemundo i do get concerned that this become a ritual that we go through every three four month where we have these horrific mass shooting and yet we 're not willing to take some basic action that we know could make a difference
but it have become a ritual and we or at least too many of our congressman and congresswoman be too afraid to act
we be stuck in a cycle of savagery as one shooter after another catch us in his sight
one reason we talk past one another on gun be that we 're talk from vastly different worldviews
accord to a march report by the pew research center gun owner be more likely to be man than woman old rather than young white rather than black or hispanic live in the midwest and south live in rural or suburban area and be marry
in many way this gun ownership division reflect the ideological split in our politics
another reason be that n.r.a. and gun lobby scare tactic have be depressingly effective
they raise the dander of one issue voter to dazzle effect and that leave politician grovel at their foot
so rational discussion get lose in the weed of extreme rhetoric
this be not an all or nothing battle
but we must approach the issue and the fact with an open mind
and we have to start with one point the vast majority of gun owner be responsible law abide citizen
they own gun for protection hunting sport or even as collector
if most of these people be not responsible there would be far more mass shooting than there be now
the problem rather be that there be simply too many gun in this country to ever ensure that some portion will not fall into the hand of the criminally inclined or the violently insane
gun proliferation be a chicken that have come home to roost
accord to the geneva base small arms survey there be an estimate 270 million civilian firearm in this country in 2011
the country with the second high number of weapon 46 million be india which have nearly four time the population of america
a november 2012 congressional research service report put the estimate even high at approximately 310 million firearm available to citizen
that ' almost one gun to every man woman and child in this country
that lead to this idea of gun as protection the idea that because criminal already have gun law abide citizen need to have them too just to even the play field or dare i say kill field
accord to that march pew report protection have replace hunting as the no 1 reason that people own gun
the notion that the world be more dangerous than it use to be and you can be keep safe only with more gun be a linchpin of the n.r.a. argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry
as the n.r.a. 's executive vice president wayne lapierre put it the only thing that stop a bad guy with a gun be a good guy with a gun
the only problem be that the fact do not neatly line up with that line of reasoning
a june report from the institute of medicine and the national research council entitle priorities for research to reduce the threat of firearm related violence have some intriguing but not conclusive finding
accord to the report there be about 300,000 violent crime involve firearm in 2008
however the estimated range of defensive us of firearm range from 108,000 to more than three million
furthermore the report point out that study of the effectiveness of the defensive use of gun have find consistently low injury rate among gun use crime victim compare with victim who use other self protective strategy
however the study hasten to add 1 2 next page
tehran a series of good will gesture and hint of new diplomatic flexibility from iran 's ruling establishment be cap on wednesday by the high level statement yet that the country 's new leader be push for a compromise in negotiation over their disputed nuclear program
in a near staccato burst of pronouncement statement and speech by the new president hassan rouhani his foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and even the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the leadership have send rosh hashana greeting to jews worldwide via twitter release political prisoner exchange letter with president obama praise flexibility in negotiation and transfer responsibility for nuclear negotiation from the conservative in the military to the foreign ministry
they 're put stuff out faster than the naysayer can keep up say gary sick an iran expert with columbia university
they dominate the airwave
mr. rouhani prepare for a trip to new york next week for the annual gathering of the united nations keep up the dizzying pace on wednesday in an interview with nbc news in which he declare that iran would never seek weapon of mass destruction include nuclear weapon and that he have full power and complete authority to make a nuclear deal with the west
there be plenty of skepticism in the west over the new tone emanate from tehran and iran veteran have see previous thaw in the diplomatic climate disappear seemingly overnight
mr. obama have speak of test mr. rouhani 's seriousness
but iran expert cite the apparent end to iran 's ideological taboo against direct talk with the united states as well as the apparent concurrence of the supreme leader say that this new moderation seem different
tehran 's turnaround be all the more startling in view of the eight often bizarre year of mr. rouhani 's holocaust deny predecessor mahmoud ahmadinejad who relish every opportunity to ruffle the feather of western leader
but mr. ahmadinejad 's bellicose nationalism drive iran into a diplomatic isolation that leave it with venezuela and syria for allies and saddle it with debilitating economic sanction over its nuclear program analyst say
those sanction have more than halve iran 's oil sale from 2.4 million barrel a day in 2011 to less than 1 million now and inflation have spike the currency the rial have fall by half
it be the danger of fall even deep into this economic abyss possibly threaten their hold on power that prompt iran 's leader to mend tie not only with the west but with their own people who desperately want more personal freedom analyst say
we be now at a unique moment in the islamic republic 's history say farshad ghorbanpour a political analyst close to mr. rouhani
economic reason be now justify political reason to talk to the u.s.
the current moment differ significantly from an earlier reform period under president mohammad khatami when the rule on public behavior and freedom of expression be relaxed
but in contrast to the current situation mr. khatami never have the serious backing of the iranian political establishment
our supreme leader mr. khamenei have give the green light that mean there will be no group try to sabotage potential talk like in the past mr. ghorbanpour say
when he arrive in new york next week one expert say mr. rouhani will be bring along a package of proposal on iran 's nuclear program which tehran say be for peaceful purpose but the west believe be a cover for develop weapon
i think he will be able to discuss iran put a cap on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuge the conversion of the stockpile of uranium enrich up to 20 percent into harmless fuel plate or dilute it down to 3 5 percent say mohammad ali shabani a political analyst base in tehran who hold moderate view
there could also be talk of iran accept more inspection by at some point ratify an additional protocol to the united nations nuclear nonproliferation treaty mr. shabani say
the german newsmagazine der spiegel report that mr. rouhani may also be ready to close down fordo iran 's highly secure mountain bunker which be believe to be safe from any israeli attack
but mr. shabani say this would not happen
this site be iran 's insurance card in case of a military attack he say
i highly doubt iran would close that down
mr. rouhani have also indicate that he prefer to negotiate over the nuclear case with the west on the high political level possible and there be even talk of a meeting next week with mr. obama an event that would have be all but inconceivable only week ago
jay carney the white house press secretary say wednesday that there be no plan for mr. obama to meet with mr. rouhani when both leader be at the united nations early next week
but he say the president be eager to see whether the issue of iran 's nuclear program could be resolve
as we have long say the window of opportunity for resolve this diplomatically be open but it will not remain open indefinitely mr. carney say 1 2 next page

san francisco beaten again james spithill the hard drive skipper for oracle team usa stand on his team 's catamaran wednesday with rough water and the bay bridge for a backdrop and answer question through a headset
it ' not over it ' a long way from over spithill say
that seem much close to bravado than to reality with emirates team new zealand need only one more victory to dispossess oracle of the america 's cup and with race 12 just about to begin
but there be other force at work in san francisco bay beyond crew work and technology worthy of nearby silicon valley
there be the wind limit put in place in the wake of the sailor andrew simpson 's accidental death in may.
those wind limit cancel both scheduled race tuesday then force the second race to be postpone wednesday with the big yacht already joust for position and head for the starting line
no the america 's cup be still not over even though it now seem only a matter of when not if the kiwis will finish off spithill and his multinational crew and their billionaire owner larry ellison
wednesday 's postponement come after team new zealand have win the day 's first race by 15 second to take an 8 1 lead in the cup
the hundred of new zealanders gather on shore at america 's cup park and perhaps as many as a million more watch back home on morning television be poise for a celebration that have be a decade in the making for the nation of 4.4 million
now the kiwis must wait until at least thursday when two more race be schedule either of which could be the final race
we can not sit back and try to play it safe say ray davies team new zealand 's tactician
we 've get to sail every race as best we can and push the boat really really hard
you really notice it
as soon as you back off a little bit on these boat and try to go a bit conservative your lead can get chop down really quick
davy and the kiwis balance risk and reward quite nicely in wednesday 's first race take advantage of their favor port entry in the strong ebb tide that have complicate this week 's racing and also make the wind limit even low
team new zealand have the lead at the starting line and then with the two boat overlap use its right of way to force oracle to drop speed
it then sail away with a clear lead that be three second at the first mark
but these ac72 capable of hydro foiling and hitting speed well over 40 knot be remarkably close in performance at this stage and oracle remain in close touch on the downwind leg
team new zealand 's lead be only six second at the second round mark and oracle even take the lead briefly on the upwind leg that follow
but the kiwis control the top of that leg beautifully
a mediocre tack from oracle contribute to significant separation and a 17-second lead at the third mark
the gap grow big until oracle sail alone and close to the boundary of the course begin to make serious gain downwind
but davy and his team be think big picture try to avoid extra jibe that could have slow their own progress
spithill and the two olympic gold medalist in his afterguard tom slingsby and ben ainslie could never conjure a way to get back in front as the kiwis respond with just a hint of desperation hold them off and round with an 18-second lead before close out their late hard fought victory
to have in the first generation of the class two boat that be this close in performance over a wide variety of condition be quite unbelievable say dean barker team new zealand 's understated skipper
i think both team have react very well to what they have observe of the other team and i think the boat have just come together in term of performance
but though the race have become tight and compelling the gap in the standing keep increase
team new zealand have win eight race to oracle 's three but because of a two race penalty impose on oracle for cheat before the cup match begin the official score be 8 1
look we have get a hell of a battle on our hand here but strange thing have happen in sport spithill say
i 've witness some pretty big comeback there be no precedent for a comeback of this magnitude in the america 's cup which date to 1851
and the prospect of lose the cup hardly seem to have san franciscans up in arm clamor for more speed from oracle team usa a team that have only one american in its start crew of 11
i 'd love to see the kiwis the little underdog that tiny little country that have more sheep than people take down larry ellison say mike altman a 35-year old american from san francisco who be follow the racing from america 's cup park on wednesday
altman add larry ' get a big ego and you know i feel like he ' not necessarily the most well like business leader around the area
he have not make a lot of friend
he ' know as pretty brash
a lot of people see this as his own personal party his own little ego trip and it ' not something that i think a lot of people be clamor for to have an america 's cup here
now it be likely to soon be go possibly never to return
in 162 year of the cup only eight site have stag the race
one of them be auckland new zealand in 2000 and 2003
no matter what spithill say into his headset a return visit look imminent

the federal reserve do the right thing when it decide on wednesday not to begin reduce the monthly multibillion dollar bond purchase that be a pillar of its effort to spur the economy
to do otherwise would have violate the fed 's own criterion for gradually withdraw the support measure

but job growth have be slow of late and what little there have be have tend to be in low pay job
the fed have also be look for a sizable increase in economic growth but that have not materialize and be unlikely to give various headwind include the prospect of another round of damaging budget fight in washington

the bond buy program which be intend to bolster the economy by keep long term borrowing rate low be not without peril
but its big danger rise inflation be nowhere in evidence
that mean that the potential stimulative benefit of the bond purchase still outweigh the potential downside
that do not mean that the program be an ideal or even particularly effective way to combat persistent economic weakness
the economy 's problem a weak labor market stagnant wage insufficient consumer demand widen income inequality intractable poverty be not primarily the fed 's to solve
rather they require direct government policy to create job raise wage spur demand increase tax on the wealthy and expand the safety net
these however be congress 's responsibility thwart largely by republicans who have oppose policy that would help the economy and thus reflect well on president obama while promote automatic budget cut and other policy that can only slow the recovery

until now the only house republicans push for a government shutdown and debt crisis be a few dozen on the radical right the one senator harry reid the majority leader refer to as the anarchist
on wednesday however the full republican caucus leadership and all join the anarchy movement announce plan to demand the defunding of health care reform as the price for keep the government open past sept. 30
the decision mean that a government shutdown next month be now much more likely
in the past shutdown threat be avert because republican leader be willing to negotiate on spending issue though the spending cut that result be often harmful to important program
but the health law be not negotiable for president obama and the democrats
by choose this as their live or die issue republicans be drive straight toward the brink and remove the brake pedal

what i will not do be to create a habit a pattern whereby the full faith and credit of the united states end up be a bargaining chip to set policy he say on wednesday morning
if republicans do not back down the double blow of a government shutdown follow by a default would be ruinous to the economy
as a strategy the house plan make little sense
after the house take its vote this week to approve a temporary resolution that pay for the government to keep run through mid december but defunds the health law the measure will go to the senate
assume 60 vote can be find to beat back the inevitable filibuster from republicans like mike lee or ted cruz the senate will almost certainly approve the resolution minus the defunding language send the bill right back to the house
nothing will have change except that there will be only a day or two leave before the government 's financing run out

many on the right who come to washington with the radical agenda of end as many government program as they could practically welcome the prospect of a shutdown or even a default
their tactic will never turn back health reform but fight that battle mean democrats be unlikely to stop the destructive sequester cut for another year
mr. boehner be play the dangerous game of try to placate the extremist for a few day

its seizure be likely to alarm syria 's neighbor
turkey which have vocally support the fight against force loyal to president bashar al assad and allow fighter and arm to flow freely across its southern border now face a bold qaeda affiliate
lebanon have seek information for more than a year about nine lebanese shiites hold captive by rebel in azaz
the town 's seizure by a group that consider shiites heretic who deserve execution be sure to increase worry about their fate
the takeover also signal a new low in relation between the rebel fight a civil war against mr. assad 's force and international jihadist who have flock to rebel control area to lay the groundwork for an islamic state
for much of the 30-month old conflict the rebel welcome jihadist fighter for the know how and battlefield prowess they bring to the anti assad struggle

if mets pitcher matt harvey have tommy john surgery on his right elbow it will be pay for partly with worker compensation insurance
a partly tear ulnar collateral ligament like harvey 's be consider a workplace injury just as if he be a truck driver hurt on a loading dock
the basic agreement between major league owner and player require that team pay the cost of injury
the employer get to recover as an offset any worker compensation recovery that be available say rob manfred an executive vice president of major league baseball
and the club be on the hook for what worker compensation do not pay
at some point after an operation or procedure a player sign a form that allow his team to pursue the insurance claim
so if worker compensation do not pay the full cost of derek jeter 's surgery for a fractured left ankle last year the yankees make up the difference essentially the cost of do business
the player never see a bill manfred say
another factor be that the cost of tommy john surgery be not uniform
dr. james andrews the renowned orthopedic surgeon may charge more than the hospital for special surgery where the mets medical director david altchek be an orthopedic surgeon
andrews prescribe a six- to eight week rehabilitation program for harvey earlier this week that would precede any decision to operate
altchek perform tommy john surgery on one of harvey 's teammate jeremy hefner
reimbursement for a surgeon 's service and hospital cost vary widely base on state fee schedule say john burton a worker compensation expert and professor emeritus at the school of management and labor relations at rutgers
a lot of state be get into fee schedule that would limit the amount of reimbursement that a practitioner or hospital would receive he say
some state like new jersey do not have a fee schedule but it ' one of the few
one baseball team executive who be not authorize to speak publicly cite recent case of insurance company reimbursement for the cost of tommy john surgery include the fee for the surgeon the anesthesia and the operating room time
in one instance the insurer pay $ 13,087 on a $ 25,075 claim
in another example the insurer pay $ 10,255 on a $ 38,076 claim
frederick m. azar an orthopedic surgeon at campbell clinic in memphis say a small local survey by his staff discover a surgeon 's fee for tommy john surgery to be nearly $ 2,900 while hospital or surgical center cost range from $ 13,000 to $ 16,000
still more money would have to be spend on rehabilitation which be easy for a professional or college athlete
a lot of athlete involve in rehab have team trainer which be a build in cost say azar the team physician for the memphis grizzlies
baseball have a single worker compensation policy through a major insurer that be for all the employee of its team not just the player
coverage with private plan like baseball 's be different from the more commonplace worker compensation insurance which be available through state but be finance by employer
for baseball whose team once handle their own insurance in this area the centralized industrywide policy that it have have for about a decade have save team ten of million of dollar in premium
manfred say team pay the premium base on the size of their payroll their injury experience and the generosity of the benefit of the state in which you operate

for example payscale do not include graduate who hold advanced degree and give that roughly 80 percent of wellesley alumna pursue graduate and professional degree we be to say the least not well represent
this mean that the payscale ranking do not include high pay career like medicine or law field in which wellesley alumna be well represent
unless and until payscale refine its analysis to reflect meaningful data its ranking system be an unhelpful distraction

zaatari refugee camp jordan those americans who count themselves as war weary should meet fawzia a middle aged woman who make perhaps the most difficult decision any parent can
fawzia be among the refugee straggle across the syria jordan border here
she have just arrive on a dangerous weeklong journey from ghouta syria a damascus suburb where nerve ga kill hundred on aug 21
but for fawzia chemical weapon be secondary
the real weapon of mass destruction in syria be the ak-47s rocket missile and bomb
an agreement broker by the world 's power that be limited to chemical weapon while useful seem a bit irrelevant to the atrocity that define the life of most syrians
no one in fawzia 's family be hurt in the chemical weapon attack but then there be a ferocious conventional shelling of her neighborhood
her family member scatter in terror and mustafa her 8-year old son disappear
no one know what happen to him
fawzia decide to flee with two child to jordan in hope of save them possibly sacrifice mustafa
she be rack by guilt
the united nations refugee agency which run this zaatari camp be accustom to tragedy
an aid worker gently tell her how to register mustafa 's name in case he turn up somewhere
talk to syrians like fawzia it seem bizarre and narcissistic that in washington there be talk of whether the syrian crisis have be resolve
maybe the politician crisis there have be ease but the humanitarian catastrophe here just get bad
indeed in the last couple of week president bashar al assad seem to have step up the pace of bombing shell and other conventional attack on civilian area
fawzia say she would like to see american missile strike on her country in hope that an assault would degrade the syrian army 's capacity for mass murder and shorten the war
that seem by far the most common view among refugee here although it ' not universal
some worry about civilian casualty or think a strike would be too little too late
whatever one think of a military strike to destroy some of assad 's murderous air force i be in favor but have very little company in america we should find common ground in insist that international negotiation address not only chemical stockpile but also humanitarian access in syria
that would mean demand that the syrian government and rebel alike allow aid worker and food and medical assistance across their line
it ' not impossible that both side would agree under pressure and that may ease some of the bad suffering within syria
valerie amos the united nations humanitarian chief tell me that nearly seven million syrians will need aid to survive
humanitarian access could save some of those life and also reduce the hemorrhage of refugee
the united nations estimate that every 17 second another syrian flee the country place almost unbearable strain on lebanon and jordan in particular
jordan have be remarkably welcome to syrian refugee but public resentment have apparently lead the government to tighten the arrival spigot recently and many ten of thousand of displace syrians be now reportedly stick on the syrian side of the border
one third of syrians be now displace
on an american scale that would be equivalent to 100 million americans have flee their home
this refugee camp zaatari be already one of the big city in jordan and the refugee be tough to manage
a few month ago they begin dismantle a trailer that function as a police station
within hour there be nothing leave they have steal an entire police station
many refugee tell me that everyone in their neighborhood would relocate to jordan if it be not so dangerous to travel
fareeda al hassan a woman from the city of hama have just cross from syria with a gaggle of child when i meet her
she explain that government bombing have destroy her home and she have see pro government militia behead child so she pay a guide to smuggle them on a 10-day journey that bypass government checkpoint
if soldier think traveler be head for jordan they sometimes execute them as presumptive traitor
during the family 's journey a machine gun post open fire on their convoy
the two vehicle in front of theirs a bus and a private car burst into flame and everyone in them be kill hassan say
guide ferry syrians to jordan sometimes give small child sleep pill so that they wo not cry from hunger and draw an attack from syrian troop
we may not be able to solve syria 's problem
i be not even certain that we can mitigate them
but we can try and a starting point would be a big push for humanitarian access
maybe that would even allow aid worker to find mustafa and reunite him with his guilt ridden mother

after lose the democratic primary last week by a wide margin district attorney charles j. hynes of brooklyn promise a smooth transition to his opponent even though he be still on the republican ticket
but now his political future have become murky while mr. hynes say on the record that he be not run as a republican three people close to him be say that he be indeed consider it
on primary night when he suffer a 10-point loss to his challenger kenneth p. thompson mr. hynes say that he would not continue to campaign for a seventh term
yet republican leader be urge him to try again in part because they believe that have mr. hynes campaign as a republican could draw voter to joseph j. lhota the party 's nominee for mayor
and mr. hynes have not quite shut the door on that possibility
though mr. hynes tell mr. thompson he be ready to start the transition process his top adviser have be explore a republican run ask others with experience in brooklyn politics whether he would stand a chance say city councilman lewis a. fidler an old friend of mr. hynes
mr. fidler say that he have not speak to mr. hynes who be on vacation but that those close to the district attorney be take the conversation very seriously
but mr. fidler a democrat say he would not advise mr. hynes to run in a borough where democrats outnumber republicans by more than 800,000
i think in the end a certain realism be go to set in he say
another person close to mr. hynes say the district attorney have back away from his resolution not to run as others include state senator martin j. golden who be a republican and mr. lhota 's adviser urge him to reconsider
reach by phone mr. hynes say that nothing have change since the primary

i say after i lose the primary that i would not actively seek re election on the republican or conservative line he say
i 'm give you a very clear definitive answer
yet when ask if he would tell republican leader not to campaign on his behalf he say i 'm the nominee of two legitimate party and i will remain as the nominee through the general election
for me to do anything else would be disrespectful of the leadership who give me the nomination in the first place
mr. hynes 's campaign manager dennis quirk do not rule out a run say no decision would be make until mr. hynes return next week
mr. quirk say the impetus for mr. hynes to run be come from republicans not the district attorney
he really can not tell the republican party not to campaign mr. quirk say
as for mr. hynes 's chance he say it ' a far stretch but it could happen
mr. hynes have be a democrat for all of his nearly 24 year as district attorney but he secure place on the republican and conservative party ballot line this year
mr. golden and other republicans have tell him he could win with a coalition of republicans and democrats who do not vote in the primary but may support him
mr. golden note that primary turnout be low with about 22 percent of democrats vote
mr. golden say there be another reason republicans want mr. hynes to campaign
it help joe lhota who will need substantial support from democrats to win mr. golden say
i think they would be a good team
a spokeswoman for mr. lhota decline to comment
in a statement mr. thompson 's spokesman james freedland say mr. hynes have pledge to exit the race and offer mr. thompson space in his office
we will take mr. hynes at his word that he will not be run as a republican in november after a lifetime in the democratic party mr. freedland say
minerva n.y. a 250-foot waterfall one of the tall in the northeast tumble over giant slab of marble
a chain of 13 crystalline lake and pond teem with bass and lake trout
a 10-mile stretch of the hudson river gorge wind through dense stand of hemlock white pine and red maple
these natural feature make up the more than 21,000 acre of the adirondacks that be recently purchase by new york state from the nature conservancy a nonprofit organization
by october the land will be entirely open to the public for the first time in more than a century
it be now part of the forest preserve allow visitor to experience a resplendent landscape in the heart of the six million acre state park
but while environmentalist town official paddler boater hiker and snowmobilers have embrace the pristine wilderness they now find themselves in a tug of war over how the land should be enjoy
should it be reserve for quiet recreation like canoe raft and hiking
or should it also be open to car motorboat and jet skis
it be a debate that have long tear at the adirondacks and it revolve around an invisible entity noise
it be a spectacular resource say joseph martens commissioner of the state 's department of environmental conservation of the new forest preserve land

the challenge be to find a way to make that resource accessible to a wide variety of people mean the elderly disabled and family but that do not damage the resource itself
it ' a balancing act
you have to respect both objective
the question come down to whether the adirondack park agency which govern land use in the park should designate the land as wilderness which prohibit the use of motorize vehicle or wild forest which allow them
the nature conservancy have remain neutral but several other environmental group include protect the adirondacks the adirondack council and the adirondack mountain club be press for a wilderness designation
the land be part of a much large acquisition in 2007 by the nature conservancy which purchase 161,000 acre from a local timber company
the $ 110 million deal which include 90 mountain peak and 300 lake and pond be hail as a milestone in the history of adirondack park a remote patchwork of private and public land in upstate new york
after meet with local official and resident the nature conservancy decide to preserve 92,000 acre as active timberland through sustainable logging a move that use the state purchase of development right to save both job and the land 's open character
the group also win a commitment from the state to buy 65,000 acre in installment over five year and add them to the forest preserve which be off limit to development and logging
this first section to be buy by the state be break up into a few parcel
the debate center mainly on the large of them a 17,320-acre area know as the essex chain of lake tract a network of lake and pond in essex county as well as a 925-acre stretch of land along the indian river
there be several different proposal for those two parcel allow vary level of motorize access
another 2,780 acre that include the waterfall call ok slip falls would be classify as wilderness under each alternative
in a study of the 200 large lake in the adirondacks protect the adirondacks determine that only a dozen be off limit to motorboat and float plane
half of those be difficult to access require long hike through wood
the group be lobby for alternative 1a which it call wilderness with access allow visitor of all ability to park their car within a short hike of the essex lake chain
we have great mountain that be wilderness and incredible stretch of forest that be wild say peter bauer executive director of protect the adirondacks
but we do not have that many big lake where people can get a wilderness experience that be timeless
but for other resident and elect official whose town encompass the recently acquire land motorize access be see as critical to revitalize the adirondacks beleaguered economy
make those connection be essential to build economic opportunity say sue montgomery corey supervisor of the town of minerva which include part of both the essex chain of lake tract and indian river tract
we would like to be able to snowmobile ride or hike to the other community ms. corey say at a public hearing hold by the adirondack park agency
hike in three mile carry a canoe from an access point will not work for most senior or most young family
the agency receive nearly 4,000 write comment that lean four to one in favor of wilderness protection while spoken testimony tilt slightly in favor of wild forest
later this year the agency will submit a recommendation to gov. andrew m. cuomo
in the meantime the state 's department of environmental conservation have weigh in with its own preference alternative 4b
wild forest but with a special management area that would provide flexibility to limit motor use
in a phone interview mr. martens say that the special management area could for instance give the state leeway to restrict motorboat to those with quiet electric engine and allow more motorized access during the less busy shoulder season of spring and fall
for the nature conservancy however the significance of add ten of thousand of acre to the forest preserve transcend the battle over noise versus silence paddle versus propeller
it ' a point that get forget in the classification debate say michelle brown a conservation scientist for the group 's adirondack chapter
this land will never be develop or harvest for timber
it ' forever wild
dr. stephen malawista an infectious disease researcher who orchestrate the detective work that in the mid-1970 lead to the discovery of lyme disease die on wednesday at his home in hamden conn.
he be 79
the cause be metastatic melanoma his wife tobe say
lyme disease begin with the transmission of bacteria through the bite of a black legged tick and can spread to muscle joint the heart and even the brain
last month the centers for disease control and prevention say lyme disease be diagnose in 300,000 americans each year
many scientist contribute to today 's understanding of lyme disease
but a team lead by dr. malawista as chief of rheumatology at the yale school of medicine and allen c. steere then a postdoctoral student be widely credit with define the ailment
their work be recognize in 1985 with the ciba geigy ilar rheumatology prize a prestigious honor in arthritis research
in present the award dr. george e. ehrlich a vice president at ciba geigy the pharmaceutical giant hail the achievement as a truly magnificent piece of medical detective work
there be few example in modern time of a single team accomplish so much in such an elegant way dr. ehrlich say
the story begin in fall 1975 when two mother one from lyme conn. the other from adjacent old lyme be distress by the odd rash neurological symptom and swollen joint that their family and others be experience
unable to find answer and frustrated each approach yale independently
the initial diagnosis be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis but that disease have never be know to appear in bunch
doctor at yale count 51 case a rate about 100 time what would have be expect to occur in a combined population of 12,000 in the town of lyme old lyme and east haddam
the case have also occur almost exclusively in warm weather month
here be a disease that by its clustering it be cluster in time it be cluster in space it be cluster in family and on road it really look like there be a vector something that transmit the disease such as an insect dr. malawista be quote as say in the book bull's eye unravel the medical mystery of lyme disease
yale university press 2003 by dr. jonathan a. edlow
the researcher report on the peculiar clustering and name it lyme arthritis dr. malawista 's idea in the journal arthritis and rheumatism in january 1977
a second article six month later suggest that antibiotic could help in some case but not in others which be still medicine 's essential view
dr. malawista and his team make the compelling link between tick and the disease by note that case be 30 time more frequent on the east side of the connecticut river where lyme be situate than on the west side
ticks fee and breed on deer and there be far more deer on the east side
dr. steere tell dr. edlow that their success have derive largely from dr. malawista 's management style
he do allow people at least the potential for a lot of autonomy dr. steere say
but the yale researcher be wrong in their initial judgment that the disease be cause by a virus and even wrong that it be truly a new disease
their announcement that it be cause by only one type of tick do not bear out
when symptom turn out to be much more diverse than arthritis they change the name to lyme disease
nonetheless their effort to study a malady that be soon cause anguish well beyond connecticut put them at the center of lyme disease research
in 1984 yale hold the first international conference on the disease
dr. willy burgdorfer work for the national institutes of health in montana find the bacterium that cause lyme disease in 1982
yale scientist then develop a vaccine which be license in 1998
it be take off the market in 2002
lyme disease remain treatable if not always curable
an antibiotic treatment usually wipe out the infection
if it do not another course of antibiotic may be administer sometimes intravenously
but bacteria can persist in the body cause harm and illness month or even year after treatment have end
stephen evan malawista be bear on april 4 1934 in manhattan

he be accept at harvard at 15 and study experimental psychology with the behavioral psychologist b.f. skinner
mr. malawista graduate magna cum laude and earn his medical degree from the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons
after decide to focus on inflammation he spend two year at the national institute of arthritis and metabolic diseases
he join the yale faculty in 1966 and be chief of rheumatology for 21 year
after his team discover lyme disease he be describe as thrilled that it could lead to an understanding of how joint inflammation can arise from infection
he be consider a leader in further understanding of how the interaction of different kind of white blood cell drive inflammation
in 1994 the american college of rheumatology present dr. malawista with its distinguished basic investigator award praise his creativity in address problem
he recognize the kernel of the unknown in them the citation say surround them with the know and search through this mechanism for insight in how to answer the question that exist
dr. malawista who share his mother 's love of theater and music start a vocal chamber music group with his wife the former tobe anne miller
dr. malawista be also survive by his half brother david malawista and his stepsister penny ritscher staccioli
dr. malawista remain fascinated by lyme disease about which many question remain
one puzzle be how the disease can reappear more than a dozen year after the initial infection
he compare that phenomenon to the dog that do not bark in a sherlock holmes mystery
what be the immune system if not a guard dog he ask
why have it stop respond to the spirochete in its midst

mr. taylor he say could get agent to work around the clock for day on end in an investigation
he could figure out how to get the job do when nobody else could mr. hardin say
after retire from government service in the late 1970 mr. taylor be a technical adviser to borderline a 1980 film loosely base on his border patrol career feature charles bronson bruno kirby and ed harris mr. taylor have a small role as a border patrolman

in an era when most city and state agency struggle under the weight of budget constraint the manhattan district attorney 's office this year find itself in an unusual position sit on a veritable windfall
in december federal and state authorities secure a record $ 1.92 billion payment from hsbc bank to settle charge that the banking giant transfer billion of dollar for nation under sanction by the united states enable mexican drug cartel to launder tainted money through the american financial system and work closely with saudi arabian bank link to terrorist organization
for its role in the investigation the manhattan district attorney 's office cash a check this week for $ 169 million slightly more than twice its total annual budget of $ 80 million
cyrus r. vance jr. the manhattan district attorney say the money would help low crime in public housing project modernize courtroom technology increase cybercrime investigative capability and add program to help keep child out of the criminal justice system
this be an unprecedented opportunity to enhance public safety in new york city mr. vance say
we be share these fund with our colleague in all five borough so that this investment of fund benefit all of new york city

the payment be the large ever make by the department of justice to a single law enforcement agency in the nearly three decade it have be share asset seize or forfeit by defendant in criminal investigation say mythili raman act assistant attorney general for the department of justice 's criminal division
under robert m. morgenthau the former manhattan district attorney the office begin investigate multinational bank that be disguise the identity of client in country on united states sanction list by strip their name from paperwork
settlement with bank by mr. vance 's office have add $ 900 million in the last four year to the city and state general fund without any guarantee that the money would be use on public safety measure
the new settlement money be arrive through a different financing stream with a requirement that it be spend on law enforcement purpose and not on continue salary
the money from such settlement have at time raise contentious issue
in 2009 as mr. morgenthau be about to leave office the administration of mayor michael r. bloomberg apparently seek to embarrass him by raise question about dozen of unregistered bank account control by his office that hold ten of million of dollar from settlement forfeiture and seizure
the city later acknowledge it have thousand of similar account that have not be register with the city comptroller 's office as be require
john c. liu the city comptroller later say the district attorney 's office should register all its account
mr. vance agree and the new settlement money be go into registered account his office say
because the amount of money be so large the department of justice require that spending plan be approve in advance
the department also require an annual audit of expenditure by an external auditor
work with the office of the mayor 's criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt mr. vance 's office have be make plan for the money for several month
federal guideline would allow mr. vance to direct the money exclusively to his own office for thing as prosaic as new car or a new office building but his office choose to share the wealth across the city 's law enforcement agency
mr. vance say he expect that the money would allow for an increase in his department 's capacity to forensically analyze electronic device something that have become a major component of many investigation and help other district attorney in the city do the same
the new york police department will also probably receive some of the money

denver the san rafael swell with its mile of twist sandstone spire and tower mesa have long be a draw for hiking and canyoneering and have even be consider for designation as a national monument
so last month when the federal bureau of land management announce its intention to open portion of the 2,000-square mile stretch of central utah for drilling by private oil and ga company conservation group react with alarm
the debate over the proposed sale of drilling lease have rekindle tension between those seek to shield wilderness area and the obama administration which have come under pressure from oil and ga company to develop more public land as it pursue a policy of energy independence
for nearly 100 year the bureau have lease tract of federally manage land to energy company which have seek to tap reserve in oil- and ga rich state like colorado new mexico and utah
dispute over the location of the drilling be not uncommon
but the announcement that dozen of parcel would be auction off in the swell a largely untouched geologic formation come as a surprise to environmental group who be worried that the administration 's energy strategy be shift away from its promise to be environmentally sensitive
we be very surprised and disappointed to see this turn of event say steve bloch legal director for the southern utah wilderness alliance
it ' a step backwards
to see a place like the san rafael swell be put up on the chopping block make no sense
on monday the utah group along with several other conservation organization file a formal protest with the bureau ask that it withdraw 55 of the propose lease
the group claim the bureau have not sufficiently weigh the environmental consequence of open part of the swell for drilling
bureau official say that recent policy change intend to slow the leasing process now ensure that tract of land like those within the swell be carefully examine before drilling be allow
and they have dispute assertion that they be appease energy company which have be critical of the administration for be too restrictive
the b.l.m. be continue to move towards full implementation of more environmentally responsible approach to oil and ga development as outline in our may 2010 leasing reform write celia boddington a bureau spokeswoman in an e mail
nationally implementation be a work in progress but we be already see positive result
accord to bureau data formal protest lodge over controversial lease be down to 317 last year from 1,475 in 2009
lease be also down
in the 2012 fiscal year some 1,729 be issue the few in any year for a decade accord to bureau data
the leasing program have face less opposition recently than it do during the bush administration when conservation organization be mire in legal battle with the federal government over how tract of land be sell
those dispute boil over during the end of mr. bush 's presidency when 77 oil and ga lease be sell near utah 's national park and recreation area
an environmental activist tim dechristopher go to prison for buy nearly $ 1.8 million worth of the lease without ever intend to pay
in 2009 ken salazar the interior secretary withdraw the lease say they have be rush
a year later the leasing program be revamp seek to better clarify which land be appropriate for drilling
now after energy company nominate lease state bureau office must undertake a more stringent environmental review and leave more time for public comment before the auction
but environmental group say those change have be slow to take hold and that parcel be be put up for lease in area where they have fend off oil and ga drilling in the past
in 2012 in colorado the bureau offer parcel near mesa verde national park for lease only to defer them before a february auction this year
a variety of organization include the state 's park and wildlife agency and the national park service raise concern about the lease
environmental group say they expect the land to be propose for leasing again
in utah which have long be grind zero for the fight over public land environmentalist note that the bureau itself consider some part of the swell to have wilderness characteristic
the area do not however have federal protection that would bar drilling altogether
in 2002 gov. mike leavitt suggest that the bush administration designate a portion of the swell as a national monument but change his mind after local resident oppose the idea
and there be some who want to see development move forward

the environmental group that be complain do not really know where the lease be or do not care say commissioner jeff horrocks of emery county who say many in the mineral rich area feel the swell could be develop while also preserve the environment
cody stewart energy adviser to gov. gary r. herbert of utah say that mr. herbert have no issue with the lease and that there be other part of the swell that better warrant protection
we do not see these lease as in high priority conservation area he say
whether the land ultimately go to auction slat for november be unclear
juan palma utah director for the bureau of land management say the bureau be review concern about drilling in the swell
the bureau recently remove about 1,000 acre from the parcel set aside for auction though the utah wilderness group note that that be only a small portion of the contested lease
it be a magnet for nanny and their charge the site of outdoor shakespeare production and a rest spot for visitor to the carroll gardens greenmarket
it be also home to numerous bench that attract teenager who do with school for the day but not yet ready to go home to other borough linger in small group for a snack a snatch of gossip and a game or two of pickup basketball
and sometimes too the park draw teenager from the housing project at the edge of the neighborhood
two shot fire on monday evening near carroll park at the heart of the brownstone neighborhood of carroll gardens brooklyn seem to fly straight from one world into the other this week underscore how even in the leafy most coddle of neighborhood the city can still show its rough edge
the police be still investigate the shot along with a fight involve as many as 20 teenager a few hour earlier on wednesday

just last month mr. alexis tell the police in rhode island that he be hear voice and be be follow by people who be bombard him with vibration
three violent incident in the past decade lead to run in with the police
for its part the department of veterans affairs say it do not have anywhere near enough clue to ring alarm bell

he be give a small refill and be instruct to follow up with a primary care provider
on both occasion mr. alexis be alert and oriented and be ask by v.a. doctor if he be struggle with anxiety or depression or have thought about harm himself or others which he deny
accord to its record the agency say mr. alexis never seek an appointment from a mental health specialist and have previously either cancel or fail to show up for primary care appointment and claim evaluation examination he have schedule at v.a. medical centers
even if he have keep the appointment it be hard to say if he would have give doctor enough reason to intervene

a second group read the same record and be also ask to look for warning sign but be not tell about murder or suicide
the group that know thing have end badly be more likely to find danger sign in the record
the second group by and large do not see much out of the ordinary
still other study dr. swanson say have find that psychiatrist be good at predict which patient will not commit act of violence but poor at recognize those who will
i wish i have better news dr. swanson say
rachel yehuda a professor of psychiatry at mount sinai hospital in new york who do research on post traumatic stress disorder say that tragedy may be avert if the police could immediately call in a mental health team when they encounter people like mr. alexis who claim to be hear voice

â
we know how to send an ambulance but maybe we should have the equivalent of a mental health ambulance
â dr. yehuda agree that predict violence be a tough call but she say that certain symptom be a warning sign include two that mr. alexis apparently exhibit hear voice and display uncontrollable anger
the idea that mr. alexis have a blackout cause by anger be especially troubling dr. yehuda say 1 2 next page
delaware announce on wednesday a new effort to encourage high achieve low income student to apply to top college say it would send application fee waiver and other information to every such high school senior in the state
the program a collaboration between gov. jack markell a democrat and the college board which administer the sat be a response to recent research showing that most poor student with high grade do not apply to any top college
instead many attend college with few resource and fail to graduate at a time when the wage gap between college graduate and everyone else be near a record high
the pattern contribute to income inequality and hold down social mobility economist say
in a separate move wednesday also in response to the recent research wellesley college unveil a calculator design to show poor and middle class student that they would pay only a small fraction of the publish tuition if they attend the college
similar calculator already exist but wellesley 's may be the simple require many few step
delaware be already one of three state idaho and maine be the others that pay for all high school junior to take the sat accord to the college board
delaware begin do so in 2010 11 in reaction to the obama administration 's race to the top education program
under the new effort pay for by the college board high achieve low income student will also receive a packet of information on selective college as well as waiver for the application fee
the information include detail on admission and financial aid policy as well as on the variation in graduation rate at different college
in a recent experiment by caroline m. hoxby of stanford and sarah e. turner of the university of virginia similar packet increase the number of student who apply to top college
the delaware packet will also include a letter from 10 elite college the member of the ivy league as well as m.i.t. and stanford say that the student be candidate for admission
the governor and the state 's education secretary will add their own letter congratulate the student on their success
because delaware be a small state with only about 9,000 high school senior the new program apply to relatively few student about 80 who be candidate for admission to elite college and an additional 300 with grade and test score high enough to be admit to other four year college
but official say they hope the model encourage large state to take similar step
kid have earn opportunity they do not take david coleman the president of the college board say in an interview
it ' our mission to fix that
one unresolved question be how college will respond if they begin receive many more application from low income student who be qualified for admission
a recent study by dr. hoxby and christopher avery of harvard find that only 34 percent of high achieve high school senior in the bottom fourth of the income distribution attend any of the country 's 238 most selective college
many who do not apply live in small metropolitan area
if more such student be to apply college could face new pressure on their financial aid budget
an array of college administrator have say they be eager to recruit more low income student even though they have largely fail to do so in recent year
wellesley a woman 's college outside boston whose alumna include hillary rodham clinton enroll a large percentage of low income student than most elite college
still official there say that many high school student remain confused about how much it would cost for them to attend and decline to apply
the new calculator which ask anonymously for six piece of financial information include income and home value will help the official say
the conversation that take place around college cost be largely misguided say phillip b. levine a professor of economics at the college who develop the calculator
people focus only on the sticker price
the publish cost of a year at wellesley include tuition room and board and fee be $ 57,042
but about 60 percent of student receive financial aid
a typical married couple earn $ 85,000 a year who have no other student in college would pay about $ 12,000 to send a child to wellesley
a typical couple earn $ 50,000 would pay about $ 4,000
the calculator somewhat understate the amount that family pay by ignore the money that student themselves pay on top of what their parent pay
most student at wellesley who receive financial aid pay about $ 5,000 a year through a combination of a loan and wage from a campus job

ryan be not here haggie be not here and step 's not here
i be plan for the guy that be
stepan 23 be a restricted free agent without arbitration right
the rangers have less than $ 3 million in salary cap space and will most likely seek a bridge deal at about $ 2.5 million per year for stepan their second round draft pick out of wisconsin in 2008 whose three year entry level contract end after last season
stepan a versatile center have not miss a regular season or playoff game in three season with the rangers

washington despite deep division that have keep congress from pass new gun safety law for almost two decade there be one aspect of gun control on which many democrats republicans and even the national rifle association agree the need to give mental health provider better resource to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buy weapon
yet effort to improve the country 's fray mental health system to help prevent mass shooting have stall on capitol hill tie up in the broad fight over expanded background check and limit on weapon sale
now the shooting at the washington navy yard by a man who authorities say show telltale sign of psychosis be spur a push to move ahead with bipartisan mental health policy change
the new debate over gun control be begin to turn not on weapon or ammunition but on the question of whether to spend more money on treat and prevent mental illness
proponent again face a steep uphill push but they see an opening even if it remain unclear whether any change under consideration could have head off the late attack in which the authorities say aaron alexis a former navy reservist buy the shotgun he use in virginia
give the clear connection between recent mass shooting and mental illness the senate should not delay bipartisan legislation that would help address this issue
senators kelly ayotte republican of new hampshire and mark begich democrat of alaska write wednesday in a joint statement to the senate leadership
the legislation they be push which be hold up when a more sweeping gun measure be defeat earlier this year would establish program to train teacher to recognize the sign of mental illness and how to defuse potentially violent situation
senator harry reid of nevada the majority leader and a strong proponent of the fail senate plan to expand the federal background check system be resist any move to advance the mental health provision fear that it would be use as a fig leaf by those who oppose expanded check while close the door to weapon restriction in the future
both ms. ayotte and mr. begich oppose the gun control bill that fail in april
some gun right advocate fear the opposite that open discussion on mental health could be a back door to a flood of new federal gun law
but several senator like senator richard blumenthal democrat of connecticut who have push for tough gun law since last year 's elementary school massacre in newtown conn. see mental health policy as a way forward
mental health be really the key to unlock this issue mr. blumenthal say
i 've become more and more convinced that we should establish the mental health issue as our common ground
but while state lawmaker have take step in recent year to make buy weapon harder for certain people show sign of mental illness in place include new york connecticut and florida where the legislation win the blessing of the national rifle association there be not yet serious discussion in congress of do so
if you 're have auditory hallucination that ' a sign of schizophrenia say senator tom coburn republican of oklahoma refer to report that mr. alexis suffer from delusion
though someone like that should not have a gun mr. coburn say he express little faith that congress could come together to write a law to fix that
it ' all politics he say
the senator help lead negotiation on a background check proposal that fall apart earlier this year
mr. alexis appear to be only the late gunman whose mental health issue do not reach the level at which he would have be prohibit from buy a firearm under federal law
and it be unknowable whether even the most drastic improvement to the nation 's mental health system would have catch and treat the symptom of someone like mr. alexis
the same can also be say for law that restrict gun ownership for people with history of mental illness
the veterans affairs department say wednesday that on the two time mr. alexis visit an emergency room in august he seem alert and deny be depress or thinking of harm himself 1 2 next page

in 2002 a novel thought to be the first write by an african american woman become a best seller praise for its dramatic depiction of southern life in the mid-1850 through the observant eye of a refined and literate house servant
but one part of the story remain a tantalizing secret the author 's identity
that literary mystery may have be solve by a professor of english in south carolina who say this week that after year of research he have discover the novelist 's name hannah bond a slave on a north carolina plantation own by john hill wheeler be the actual writer of the bondwoman 's narrative the book sign by hannah crafts
beyond simply identify the author the professor 's research offer insight into one of the central mystery of the novel believe to be semi autobiographical
how a house slave with limited access to education and book be heavily influence by the great literature of her time like bleak house and jane eyre and how she manage to pull off a daring escape from servitude disguise as a man
the professor gregg hecimovich the chairman of the english department at winthrop university in rock hill s.c. have uncover previously unknown detail about bond 's life that have shed light on how the novel be possibly write
the heavy influence of dickens for instance particularly from bleak house can be explain by bond 's onetime servitude on a plantation that routinely keep boarder from a nearby girl school the curriculum there require the girl to recite passage of bleak house from memory
bond secretly form her own novel could have listen while they study or spirit away a copy to read
the research also show that bond may have be give a man 's suit by a member of the wheeler family who be sympathetic to her desire to flee
professor hecimovich 44 say that he have verify the writer 's identity through will diary handwritten almanac and public record
he intend to publish his full finding in a book tentatively title the life and times of hannah crafts
his work have be review by several scholar who vouch for its authenticity include henry louis gates jr. one of the nation 's pre eminent scholar of african american history
professor gates buy the obscure manuscript at auction in 2001
word can not express how meaningful this be to african american literary study he say in an interview
it revolutionize our understanding of the canon of black woman 's literature
professor gates say that professor hecimovich 's discovery answer one of the large and linger question that have vex him for more than a decade about the author of the book
hollis robbins the chairwoman of the department of humanities at the peabody institute of johns hopkins university call it a tremendous finding
i 'm totally convinced she say to the extent that anything historical can be document without an iphone picture of her write the novel

the book whose language borrow from 19th century gothic novel trace the story of its narrator who endure life as a slave on a north carolina plantation and aid by her light complexion successfully escape to the north
that tale closely mirror the story of bond
enslave on a plantation in murfreesboro n.c. bond be believe to have be a self educate woman who work as a maid to the mistress of the house ellen wheeler assist her with errand and personal duty like style her hair
but around 1857 bond disguise herself as a boy and escape flee first to upstate new york and then to new jersey where she eventually marry and find work as a schoolteacher
the novel professor hecimovich believe have its beginning in the wheeler home where bond could have have access to the family 's library and its writing material include a distinctive paper that be use to connect the novel to the wheelers 1 2 next page
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 21 2013an article on thursday about the successful effort to identify the author of a novel about a slave 's life in the 19th century refer incompletely to the academic post hold by hollis robbins a scholar who review the research

new data be release on thursday by the census bureau lend support to that argument show that even as the recession have end the city 's poverty rate continue to inch up and the gap between the rich and poor remain stubbornly large
it ' not good news say david r. jones president of the community service society a research and advocacy group
we 're three year into a recovery and the poverty rate be creep upward
i do not think this have to mean an all out call for class warfare but it ' a serious threat to the viability of the city of new york
this be go to drag us all down
mr. de blasio who have attract populist support with his message of economic inequality say the late census data reinforce the need for the next mayor to alter course
i wish it do n't he say
his republican opponent joseph j. lhota have accuse mr. de blasio of promote class warfare but mr. lhota acknowledge on wednesday that poverty remain a critical problem
there be no question that people be suffer in this economy mr. lhota say
the key to lift people out of poverty be through the creation of career job and education

the poverty rate rise to 21.2 percent in 2012 from 20.9 percent the year before mean that 1.7 million new yorkers fall below the official federal poverty threshold
that increase be not statistically significant but the rise from the 2010 rate of 20.1 percent be
despite such a gloomy picture bloomberg administration official say the city be fare better than others
the national recession increase poverty rate across the country but other major city saw their poverty rate increase by more than what we have see in new york city largely because we have be a national leader in create job and break the cycle of poverty linda i. gibbs the deputy mayor for health and human service say
in 2012 the increase in poverty that result from the national recession level off but there remain an enormous amount of work to do to connect those struggle to new job and opportunity
since 2000 she say the city have go to 13th high from 6th high among poverty rate for the 20 big city
the census data do contain some other good news
in the city median household income inch up to $ 50,895 from $ 50,657 after decline for three year from its recent high of $ 54,695 in 2008
and 6 of the nation 's 10 large city have high poverty rate although 4 record decline compare with 2011
on average new york have a low poverty rate few people without health insurance and a high median household income than other major metropolitan area
a deep look at the poverty rate show that it vary widely and predictably
it be high among black and hispanic new yorkers
among child 17 and young 31 percent fall below the poverty line
so do 32 percent of family head by a single mother and 19 percent of new yorkers age 65 and over
fourteen percent have no health insurance include 4 percent of child under 18
fifty percent of homeowner with mortgage and 54 percent of renter spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing

ms. stephens be refer to a battle in congress over a farm bill which some conservative say must reduce spending on food stamp
joel berg executive director of the new york city coalition against hunger say some of the increase in food stamp recipient could be attribute to government policy like shorten application form and no longer require finger imaging
still he say one million new yorkers on medicaid be not get food stamp and a large number would be eligible

a new study provide the best evidence yet that wear a back brace will slow the progression of the most common form of scoliosis in adolescent help them avoid painful spine surgery
physician have recommend brace for more than 50 year but until now study of its effectiveness have produce mixed result
the united states preventive services task force recommend against scoliosis screening in school partly on the ground that there be insufficient evidence that brace and other conservative treatment relieve back pain or improved quality of life in these child
the new randomized study publish on thursday in the new england journal of medicine should end the longstanding debate several expert say and may spur the task force to reconsider its position
the trial be very convincing say dr. b. stephens richards a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at texas scottish rite hospital in dallas
it scientifically prove that brace treatment work for adolescent with scoliosis who be at risk of curve worsen to the point of need surgery
adolescent girl be more likely than boy to have idiopathic scoliosis or curvature of the spine from no known cause
rigid bracing be wear to restore spine alignment by external force
it be a demand treatment at a vulnerable time of life
when you have a teenager who be anxious about wear a brace to school or what their friend will think it give us a bit of heartache to try to convince them if we be not certain ourselves say dr. paul d. sponseller the director of orthopedic surgery at johns hopkins children 's center who be not involve in the study

in light of this new evidence we can say we really do have a basis for put them through brace
in the study researcher analyze data on 242 patient at 25 site across the united states and canada
the child be all age 10 to 15 and still grow and they all have a spinal curvature of 20 to 40 degree
of those patient 116 be randomly assign to observation or brace for at least 18 hour daily
because too few family agree to randomization the researcher add a group of 126 adolescent who choose for themselves between bracing and observation
bracing be deem a failure if spinal curvature progress to 50 degree or more a point at which surgery be often suggest
it be deem a success if the child achieve skeletal maturity without this degree of curve progression
the trial be stop early because of the apparent efficacy of brace
in the analysis that include both group the rate of treatment success be 72 percent among child with bracing compare with 48 percent among those under observation
the benefit increase the longer brace be wear
more than 90 percent of the child who be successfully treat wear their brace more than 13 hour a day
dr. richards the immediate past president of the scoliosis research society say the study 's strength be the inclusion criterion limited to adolescent most at risk for spinal curve progression and the use of a high tech temperature sensitive device in the brace to measure compliance objectively
there be a lot of doctor like me who treat scoliosis as the primary focus of their practice who have doubt about whether brace be effective say dr. stuart l. weinstein the lead author of the study and a professor of orthopedic surgery at the university of iowa
now the jury be in
bracing have be the standard of care since the 1940
it take so long to perform a rigorous trial of its effectiveness not only because it be a gargantuan task say joe o'brien the president of the national scoliosis foundation but also because parent do not want to just sit there and wait and watch

such a study raise moral challenge too

ethically you have to accept that some patient will be randomized to not use a brace and your presumption be they will end up need surgery say dr. john t. smith a professor in the orthopedics department at the university of utah
when her daughter maddie be give a scoliosis diagnosis at age 10 becky houser of north liberty iowa want to avoid surgery at all cost
so maddie a participant in dr. weinstein 's study choose to wear a brace
we do not want to not do anything say mrs. houser who manage rental property
thirty year ago she undergo surgery for scoliosis herself spend three week in a hospital and nine month in an upper body cast
after three year of wear baggy top and yoga pant to school to accommodate the brace maddie now 13 be thrill to learn that her spinal curvature be hold steady at 28 degree
with no more major growth spurt leave she no longer need brace
we be extremely relieved mrs. houser say
a common surgical treatment spinal fusion entail put screw and rod in the spine to straighten it
the procedure have greatly improve but young patient still face risk like infection bone healing problem and rarely paralysis
despite the apparent success of brace the study do not pinpoint which child be most likely to benefit from it
indeed the researcher find that outcome be successful in 41 percent of the intervention group even though they seldom wear the brace
conversely erica shumaker a high school freshman in tipton iowa wear her brace 22 hour a day while participate in the study
yet her spinal curvature progress and she be likely to need surgery
her brace be not help as much as they think it would say her father rick shumaker

but there ' nothing we would do any different
vilamoura portugal for humberto sousa life in vilamoura mean there be only two item on his to do list choose a beach for the day and select a restaurant for the night

vilamoura initially be create in 1966 by a banker from porto antonio cupertino de miranda the current developer be lusotur own by the catalunyacaixa saving bank
what seem to be the resort 's strong attraction be the privacy provide by its large building plot
mr. sousa 's five bedroom villa sit on a 4,277-square meter or 46,037-square foot site in the resort 's old and most exclusive neighborhood pinhal velho portuguese for old pine

portugal 's economic crisis have see the housing market stumble over the last four year although suzana bento manage director of mapro real estate in the nearby town of almancil say thing finally be start to look up this year

washington few american president have hold a deep belief in the power of the write word than president obama
and in few way have that belief be more test than in his frustrating private correspondence with the leader of iran a country with which the united states have have no diplomatic tie for 34 year
this week mr. obama indicate that he may finally have find a pen pal in tehran
at the core of iran 's recent diplomatic charm offensive a process that have include the release of 11 prominent political prisoner and a series of conciliatory statement by top iranian official be an exchange of letter confirm by both side between mr. obama and president hassan rouhani
the election of mr. rouhani a moderate in june kindle hope that diplomacy may end the chronic impasse with iran over its nuclear ambition
but the letter and the cautious hope they have generate suggest there be a genuine opportunity for change
it be not the first time since enter the white house that mr. obama have put pen to paper to try to sway iran 's leadership
until now he have have little to show for it even under the pain of punish economic sanction the iranian government have show little interest in negotiate a deal with washington on its nuclear program
this time mr. rouhani say in an nbc news interview broadcast on wednesday the tone of mr. obama 's letter be positive and constructive
he add it could be subtle and tiny step for a very important future
mr. obama speak to the spanish language network telemundo on tuesday say there be indication that mr. rouhani be somebody who be look to open dialogue with the west and with the united states in a way that we have not see in the past
and so we should test it
the president have test iran before
have promise as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemy he send a letter early in his first term to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei propose a new diplomatic chapter
ayatollah khamenei send a reply but fail to take mr. obama up on his offer
their correspondence be cut short after iran 's dispute presidential election in june 2009 unleash a popular uprising
the ensue bloody crackdown all but snuff out diplomacy for the next year
the re elect president mahmoud ahmadinejad write a lengthy letter to mr. obama in 2010 but it do nothing to break the diplomatic ice
the white house decline to discuss the content of mr. obama 's letter to mr. rouhani
but a senior administration official say it reflect the president 's judgment that mr. rouhani should be take very seriously in part because he appear to have a broad mandate within iran
this be the first time that mr. obama have write directly to an iranian president and not the supreme leader
that suggest that the white house believe ayatollah khamenei have empower mr. rouhani at least for now to seek an opening with the west
mr. ahmadinejad though not as hostile to a nuclear agreement as sometimes portray be undermine by other senior official and do not enjoy the supreme leader 's full confidence
the administration 's previous position be that we correspond with the person who make decision say ray takeyh an iran expert at the council on foreign relations
now they 're send them to rouhani
another major difference be that the new exchange of letter come in the wake of the administration 's agreement with russia to seek the peaceful transfer of syria 's chemical weapon
to make that plan work analyst say it would be helpful for iran as the staunch regional ally of president bashar al assad of syria to play a constructive role
whether that be possible be highly questionable of course
but it give mr. obama a broad diplomatic context in which to engage mr. rouhani
the united states have generally insist on negotiate with iran purely on its nuclear program which have leave both side with little to talk about after the inevitable clash over the number of centrifuge or the amount of enrich uranium that the iranians be produce
at the end of the day obama stumble into diplomacy because of what happen with syria say trita parsi president of the national iranian american council who have write a book about mr. obama 's diplomatic effort a single roll of the dice

iran 's news medium have report that mr. obama 's letter include a plea to re engage in diplomacy a suggestion depend on how any talk go that the united states would be willing to ease sanction and a request to initiate direct discussion between washington and tehran something diplomat say be critical to strike a nuclear deal
none of this should be a big surprise
the united states have long be eager for direct talk with iran
the big question be whether mr. rouhani be in the position to make concession on a nuclear program that tehran insist be for peaceful purpose and that the united states suspect be aim at achieve the ability to produce nuclear weapon
if direct negotiation be to begin mr. obama 's letter writing skill may again be call into play
presidential correspondence say dennis b. ross who advise mr. obama on iran at the white house be use often in negotiation as a form of assurance or clarification
mr. ross say the president 's reliance on letter to iranian leader make sense because in the absence of a formal relationship there be few other fully authoritative way to convey a message we completely control
the letter his adviser say also reflect the value that mr. obama attach to direct diplomacy
mr. obama and mr. rouhani both plan to speak to the united nations general assembly on tuesday
will they try an even more direct form of diplomacy greet each other in person
the white house say nothing be plan
for now though mr. obama 's pen pal diplomacy have accomplish the most basic goal of any letter
it get a reply

the beauty of the champions league and the beast within it be in full display on the second night of the tournament
we should never tire of admire lionel messi surely the fine artist in the sport
at time his rivalry with cristiano ronaldo seem to defy the accepted wisdom that soccer be a team game
how do we account for ronaldo score a hat trick in istanbul on a tuesday and then messi rise to the challenge and notch three impudent goal of his own in barcelona the follow evening
each messi goal come from his left foot the first an immaculate 25-yard free kick that brush a post before it nestle in the top corner of the net
goal 2 and 3 be low deft placement as the little argentine dare defender to touch him and then he dodge them as they try
with another goal head in by gerard pique barã§a hammer ajax 4 0
messi 's accumulation of score after score in the champions league have give him the best goal to game ratio since european club competition begin in the 1950s
his 62 goal in 80 match compare to raãºl 's 71 in 144 ruud van nistelrooy 's 60 in 88 andrey shevchenko 's 59 in 116 and ronaldo 's 54 in 96
one almost feel sorry for ronaldo
even his career total of 21 hat trick do not match messi 's 24
yet wednesday be not simply one special player 's night
the swiss team fc basel come from a goal down to defeat chelsea the 2012 european champion 2 1 on chelsea 's turf in london
that be historic because basel have visit england 10 time before without win once
chelsea score first through their brazilian player oscar but little by little the swiss team that cost a pittance compare to chelsea overhaul that lead
first mohamed salah a 21-year old from egypt curl a shot around fullback ashley cole use the defender to hide the ball from goalkeeper petr cech until it be too late
then marco streller basel 's 32-year old captain guide the ball inside cech 's near post with a header follow a corner kick
jose mourinho back as chelsea coach six year after owner roman abramovich fire him say that he be not shock by the defeat and that he would be at his workplace at 7 the next morning to put it right
we be punish in our defensive corner where we be strong mourinho say
emotionally this be not a very mature team
his implication be that chelsea need rebuild
john terry do not play at all and frank lampard be miss from the midfield at the end so chelsea be lack in leadership
the owner visit the player dressing room afterward and one good question for him to ask be why fernando torres the man for whom chelsea pay â£50 million or $ 80 million be not even on the bench
and why juan mata last season 's most inspirational forward appear only as a substitute
chelsea it have to be say be try to be a different team from the first one that mourinho build into a pragmatic and methodical but win unit
i would like to say it be a miracle but we make it in tottenham and we make a draw in manchester streller say refer to draw in previous europa and champions league match
once it be 1 1 tonight i tell the boy we can win here
he smile before add and they listen to me
on the same night arsenal stretch its run of away victory in the champions league to a record break 10 straight game
arsenal 's french coach arsã¨ne wenger take his team to southern france where it beat marseille 2 1
we have be audacious away explain wenger where sometimes we play with the hand brake at home because we lack that confidence
his team ride its luck in a patchy first hour during which the diminutive mathieu valbuena often give marseille the edge in creativity
but after marseille have miss their chance arsenal capitalize on a defensive howler from jeremy morel
his attempt to clear with a header looped into the air and as it drop theo walcott keep his eye on the ball and sweetly volley it high and handsomely into the goal
twenty minute later aaron ramsey allow the move ball to cross in front of him then outwit his marker with a smart turn and a low shot that deflect off the foot of defender nicolas n'koulou into the net
in stoppage time one marseille brother andre ayew win a penalty kick that the other jordan ayew convert
that be a mere consolation arsenal the club that pay â¬50 million or $ 67 million for one player mesut ãzil have beat marseille which spend slightly less than that to acquire six new team member in the summer
food for thought there
the best the player who can make a world of difference come at a price that few and few team can afford
one club that come close last season to disprove that theory be the champions league finalist borussia dortmund
in the pour rain in southern italy on wednesday dortmund lose more than the game against napoli
the german side concede goal to gonzalo higuaã­n and lorenzo insigne and with juan zãºã±iga gift dortmund an own goal near the end the match finish 2 1 in favor of napoli
dortmund compound defeat by lose its dignity
its goalkeeper captain roman weidenfeller be red card before halftime after rush out of his penalty area and deliberately use his hand to prevent a scoring opportunity
but weidenfeller 's be an impulsive mistake
what dortmund 's coach jã¼rgen klopp do midway through the first half be beyond condone
he be outrage by the opening napoli goal while his defender neven subotic be off the field be treat for an injury
klopp often the joker of dortmund rag at the fourth official mock him bawl into his face appear to physically threaten him
rightly klopp be send to the stand and no doubt uefa will ban him for further match
but this be the beast of soccer the ugly face that any right minded parent will not allow their child to view on youtube

in prague the top end of the property market have remain unscathed by the economic crisis ms. yakubovych say add that there continue to be demand for luxury property in the city particularly in the old town an area on the list of unesco world heritage sites
the area originally a medieval settlement date from the ninth century now be a collection of architectural style include neo gothic renaissance cubist and functionalist
for ms. yakubovych the development of a luxury property must reflect the building 's history combine original feature with modern touch
the flat that we like to do the most be in traditional building from the beginning of the 20th century she say
i always try to see the potential in an old building
sometimes i can even picture the design of the door handle
the art residence build date from the mid-1930 and be one of the first building in the city to use a steel reinforce concrete structural system rather than the traditional wooden core
the renovation which include replace the damage roof require permit from five authorities
while the bureaucracy may seem daunting many observer say it have help preserve the old town as the number of historic renovation have increase
the single hardest issue with work on building in the historical center be balance the client 's wish with what the city authorities will allow say danyal downer of ian bryan architects a local agency
the heritage department be often see as the enemy but the truth be that without their intervention the city center would quickly lose its charm
art residence 's flagship apartment name l'art de vivre cover the building 's top floor offer special view of the national theater from the kitchen 's dining nook
the two bedroom two and a half bath property be on the market for 34 million czech koruna or $ 1.76 million
the two other unit already have be sell the 205-square meter or 2,207-square foot gallery apartment for 24 million koruna and the 105-square meter mosaic apartment for 12 million koruna
both of those apartment be on the sixth floor of the building the unit on the low floor be sell as unfinished shell

it run the length of the apartment and offer glimpse of prague castle petrin hill and the astronomical clock as well as the national theater and the academy of sciences
the main bedroom have its own 48-square meter terrace
the apartment be name after a 1917 vessel now use as a river cruise barge in france a title inspire by the slant roof of the main room which ms. yakubovych say bring to mind a hull
the ba relief wood paneling in a stormy sea gray that be use throughout the apartment set off the decor 's light cream white and gray
the fitting include inlaid marble flooring in the foyer hide walk in closet and storage space as well as private elevator access
parking and extra storage be available in the basement next door to the laboratorio scuola di cucina cook school which share its official opening with the unveiling of art residence in may.
the apartment reflect the building 's name with modern chandelier in the living room and bedroom create by the glasswork preciosa in the town of jablonec nad nisou
also ira svobodova a local artist create a series of abstract geometric painting for the apartment most of which be sell at the launch party on may 22
ms. yakubovych and ms. svobodova have cooperate on project previously
for ms. yakubovych the art residence reflect both its interior design and the surroundings
with this property the location be key she say
this area be very interesting because it ' very close to everything
the developer say she believe such project be the future of old town as they will draw more resident into the city center and revitalize it as more than just a tourist spot
london when a judge rule that a 22-year old muslim defendant must remove her full face veil during testimony albeit behind a screen so that only the judge jury and lawyer may track her facial response there be much heady talk about the implication for europe 's restless and unresolved struggle with issue of faith and identity tolerance and freedom
but a pithier riposte come from salma yaqoob a muslim and former city councilwoman in birmingham who rhetorically ask a reporter from the guardian whether the full face veil the niqab should really absorb so much debate in a land seize with far broad social and economic challenge
be this the big issue we face in the u.k. right now she ask
but it be not an issue that be likely to go away four day after the court ruling there be report that 17 hospital have also order staff to remove full face veil when in contact with patient
and the question arise whether the furor be not so much about the niqab a supposed symbol of piety as the telltale marker of a deep sense of difference between faith sharpen by year of war in muslim land abroad that wrench britain 's social fabric at home
the debate be not new
in 2006 question about the niqab arise in the case of aishah azmi a 24-year old teaching assistant who be dismiss from her job for refuse to remove the full face veil in class
at that time a year after the london bombing of july 2005 britons be in a state of shock after their brutal encounter with islamic militancy when four suicide bomber kill 52 traveler on the london transit system
tony blair then the prime minister call the full face veil a mark of separation contradict the vaunted striving of a society that for decade seek to place ethnic and religious diversity ahead of enforce integration
the temperature of debate this time seem low but there be other portent
britain 's muslim population be significantly big rise from 1.6 million or 3 percent of the population in 2001 to 2.8 million accord to the washington base pew forum on religion and public life an increase that make britain 's muslim minority europe 's third most populous after those in france and germany
while congregation dwindle in traditional christian church islam be grow
society be change offer new challenge and perhaps a new assertiveness among muslims that unsettle those who expect a degree of pliancy from their minority
britain have a proud tradition of attract and welcome religious minority of offer them refuge from persecution and a place where they can practice their faith freely the conservative daily telegraph say in an editorial
but one reason why our society be both diverse and relatively peaceful be because we ask that people respect our value and do not resist integration
in this week 's court case judge peter murphy rule on a core principle establish over century of open justice say that if a fair trial be to take place the jury and for some limited purpose the judge must be able to assess the credibility of the witness
in my judgment the adversarial trial demand full openness and communication judge murphy say
i be fairly convinced that the wearing of the niqab necessarily hinder that openness and communication
by inference too the case raise question about the state 's right to curtail individual freedom particularly in the name of security concern
i think it ' for woman to make a choice about what clothes they wish to wear say theresa may the home secretary
if they wish to wear a veil that be for a woman to make a choice
but she continue there will be some circumstance in which it ' right for public body for example at the border at airport security to say there be a practical necessity for ask somebody to remove a veil
the debate be not limited to britain or europe suggest a broad social questioning as the tectonic plate of religion seem to shift
france for instance outlaw the wearing of the full face veil in public place two year ago

i make that claim because i respect your dignity and your right to self determination he continue address the russian people
you should be govern by a rule of law that be clear consistently and impartially enforce and just
i make that claim because i believe the russian people no less than americans be endow by our creator with inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he add

mr. putin use his remark and a question and answer session to touch on a wide range of subject and he portray the event itself as proof that there be no suppression of speech in russia
at one point mr. putin defend a new russian law ban propaganda on nontraditional sexual relation which be widely perceive as intend to suppress homosexuality
he say that the law do not discriminate but also that europeans be die out in part because of societal acceptance of gay relationship
even as he suggest that mr. mccain be stick in the past mr. putin raise his own complaint with a cold war edge
once we be promise that nato will not cross the eastern border of germany he say
we discuss it and gorbachev be give a promise though it be not register anywhere
and now where be nato
and where be the border
we be simply dupe
mr. mccain cite the propaganda law in his article criticize mr. putin 's government
they write law to codify bigotry against people whose sexual orientation they condemn he write
he do not defend united states policy but accuse mr. putin of shield the government of president bashar al assad of syria
how have he strengthen russia 's international stature
mr. mccain ask
by ally russia with some of the world 's most offensive and threaten tyranny
mr. mccain be not the first member of congress to respond to mr. putin in the russian news medium

he should some empathy about how emotionally painful it be for her to be leave behind she need to understand that he be do the proper thing as a son to visit his mother and be not just escape his wife

paris a lithuanian custom officer in kosovo work for a european union mission there be shoot dead on thursday in the serb dominate north of the country european union official say
the european union mission that oversee judicial affair in northern kosovo say in a statement that the shooting take place early thursday during a routine staff rotation
it say a murder investigation be under way
bernd borchardt head of the mission know as eulex call the attack an unequivocal ambush say stojan pelko a european union spokesman
mr. pelko say by telephone from pristina kosovo 's capital that six custom officer travel in two car be return from a border crossing when one of the car be fire on critically wound the lithuanian custom officer
he be dead on arrival at a hospital
the associated press cite a hospital chief say the man have be shoot in the chest and leg
mr. pelko say the other officer in the car a czech have no visible wound but have be take to the hospital
he say that it be not know how many people be involve in the attack and that the area have be seal by police officer
we do not know who shoot him and the perpetrator escape he say
we be ask citizen for any information they can provide and we be look for witness
the european union mission condemn the attack call it an act of cowardly violence
the bloc 's foreign policy chief catherine ashton condemn the killing and call on serbs and ethnic albanians to redouble effort to press ahead with an agreement aim at overcome ethnic enmity in the country
the shooting come as kosovo and serbia have be try to carry out a power share accord that the two country sign in april
the agreement under which serbia agree to recognize pristina 's authority over the police and the court in the north in return for great autonomy for kosovo 's northern serbs have be greet with deep ambivalence and in some case outright hostility by some of the north 's 50,000 serbs
while the agreement stop short of serbs recognize kosovo 's independence which belgrade vehemently oppose it have be laud by the european union which broker it as a breakthrough that could help overcome ethnic division and cement peace in the region
some serbs however have vow to resist the accord boycott municipal election plan for early november and leave kosovo
the european union mission have be oversee the police court and custom in kosovo which declare independence from serbia in 2008
while a majority of serbs reject kosovo 's independence the north in particular have remain a conflict zone because until recently a majority of serbs there live almost entirely under belgrade 's authority
serbian flag fly in the serbian part of mitrovica local drink serbian brew and belgrade have pay the salary of municipal official
georgios makeroufas a political adviser to the european union 's rule of law mission in northern kosovo say from kosovo that it be too early to assess the fallout from the killing or whether it would further inflame ethnic tension
but he emphasize that so far thing be relatively quiet
but analyst say the european union face a daunting challenge to ensure that the power sharing agreement be put into effect with resistance from many serbs in the north as well as from a vocal minority of ethnic albanians in kosovo who argue that the accord entrench division
in a sign of the obstacle ahead staff member in the office grant kosovo identification card in the north have have hand grenade lob at their home while one senior administrator be shoot in the leg late last year
angela merkel have a reputation as something of an enigma
biographer commentator and political opponent have create a cottage industry of merkel astrology around a leader that everyone find hard to read
with a general election schedule in germany for sunday a poll at which the chancellor be likely to win a mandate for a third term speculation be rife about merkel 's political course especially on foreign policy
but contrary to widely hold belief the chancellor 's position be in fact not all that difficult to identify
merkel have basically make three fundamental decision that have define the structure of her foreign policy
the first decision be to ensure that germany reject any kind of geopolitical ambition
the country have be a very useful enabler of the european union 's foreign policy in the western balkans but it have shy away from strengthen europe 's diplomatic or military capability in more substantial structural way
the same be true for nato where germany have forward a number of initiative on technical issue but be see as disengage from the big strategic discourse on the future of the western alliance in a change global security landscape
merkel have unenthusiastically heed old german military commitment in afghanistan and kosovo but she have keep germany firmly out of entanglement in the new type of crisis management operation that be emerge from the crisis in libya mali and syria
in all of this she can feel safely in agreement with the overwhelming majority of the german public
in the absence of large more global ambition what matter most in assess merkel 's foreign policy be her decision in relation to europe
this be where the crisis of the european single currency have force her against her instinct to become a decisive player and a risk taker
it be in this field that merkel 's other two fundamental foreign policy decision fall and it be here that her foreign policy legacy will be define
her second decision be to turn the euro zone into a de facto transfer union lite by guarantee the currency 's survival with pledge of billion of german taxpayer euro
in return she have since be push for immediate structural economic reform in the recipient country combine with medium- to long term project such as fiscal union and joint oversight instrument like the european stability mechanism
a bank union be still in limbo but may complete the picture in the not so distant future
all of these effort have one thing in common more or less strict oversight over a nation 's financial and economic policy
none of this would have be thinkable only a few year ago
this mean in simple term that merkel have preside over a substantial deepening of e.u. economic integration
with the measure she have take to remedy the crisis now firmly in place the european union have integrate faster and more substantially than in any previous five year period
true most of this have not be wholly voluntarily
much of it be dictate by the crisis
but in the end it be largely merkel who design or enable these great integrationist leap forward
merkel 's third decision be perhaps the most fateful one
the german chancellor have determine that she favor a politically less integrate europe after the crisis
in august she announce in a radio interview that now be the time to think about give some power back from brussels to the member state
she do not go into specific but add that europe from now on would not necessarily require more common policy with decision make by the brussels base institution
improve governance could be achieve through better coordination among member state
this victory for merkel 's long stand intergovernmental instinct over an age old german pro integration tradition be nothing less than revolutionary particularly when compare with the ideology of helmut kohl under whose tutelage she enter the political stage
perhaps it be mean to counterbalance the enormous push toward close economic integration
but it be clear that again merkel have ally herself with the majority of germans who think that europe 's economic side be great but that its political side be increasingly sinister
merkel 's third decision be risky
first of all it rest on the flawed assumption that economic and political integration can be separate from each other when the basic lesson of the euro crisis be that you can not have one without the other
second it fatefully tie her to the politically weaken british prime minister david cameron who share her vision of repatriate many government function and favor intergovernmental deal make over the e.u. 's classic community method but whose inability to control his own party be cause him existential problem at home
third merkel 's decision rip the very engine out of the entire integration idea that germany europe 's historically problematic core country underwrite the ever fragile idea of european politics transcend the merely national
of merkel 's three fundamental foreign policy decision strategic abstention be understandable but unsustainable in the long run her recipe to tackle the crisis be probably correct but could create severe collateral damage and her intergovernmental turn revolutionize the integration project by risk some of its historic achievement
expect merkel 's post election foreign policy to be build around these three foundation
if it work out which it could it be pure genius
if not generation from now historian will wonder what drive that enigmatic woman

for one thing that admire director deborah warner who lead the production 's first iteration at the english national opera in 2011 undergo an unexpected surgical procedure this summer and could not come to the met
ms. shaw her longtime collaborator on broadway production of medea and the testament of mary among others who have also never direct at the met take on the assignment at what in opera amount to the very last minute
the met approve the switch even though ms. shaw have a partly overlapping commitment to direct britten 's rape of lucretia for the glyndebourne festival 's fall tour back in england a project she have no intention of shortchanging
she have also direct three production for the english national opera since 2008
so after start rehearsal for onegin on aug. 13 ms. shaw leave new york on sept. 6
her only subsequent visit to the city be that recent friday sept. 13 to work on the first and third act and give note to the cast before fly back in the evening
she stand in the darkened auditorium half illuminate behind the lighting board in constant motion seek atmosphere while the soprano anna netrebko pour out her heart onstage and valery gergiev conduct with his customary inscrutable hand flutter in the pit
ms. shaw point to a spot on the stage then another and another
the light would change as she go make abrupt shift from cool white to rich yellow and back again as she and the designer try out different option for the classic story draw from pushkin 's verse novel about miss attempt at love between a bookish girl and a bored aristocrat
with the addition of some light from the wing a scene that have seem stark suddenly turn warm a forbid character become in the glow of a well place spot heart wrench
atmosphere gradually emerge but the work be complex slow and frustrating and ms. shaw need to get a lot do in very little time
the down side of her arrangement with the met be that ms. shaw be never able to see the second act with its grand ball scene and harrowing duel onstage with the orchestra not to mention any of the show 's final run throughs
nor as of press time do she plan to return for opening night
all of this be extremely unusual for such a prominent production particularly at the met which these day loudly and proudly tout its theatrical bona fides
the basic direction be do say the met 's general manager peter gelb in an interview
most of the detail work be do now it ' really a question of just follow it up and make sure people remember what they 're suppose to be do
mr. gelb say that he and the production team could together handle the execution of what he call ms. shaw 's meticulous note in her absence there ' always some amount of fine tuning go on but the basic blocking of the movement of the performer everything they 're do be set
direction in a production 's final stage though be not just about set the blocking
it be also about tiny detail about be on the scene to approve small yet tell shift from the light to the acting and to experience the full production and make last minute suggestion
it ' an unusual situation mr. gelb acknowledge
besides the scheduling issue with ms. shaw there be the matter of the petition
the online petition that is sign by almost 9,000 that criticize president vladimir v. putin 's antigay policy in russia that say tchaikovsky be gay which many music scholar believe but be not universally accept at the moment and that call on the met to dedicate the opening night performance to the issue
mr. putin who in june sign the law ban propaganda on nontraditional sexual relationship be not as distant from this onegin as one may think
he have be a crucial backer of mr. gergiev the director of the mariinsky theater in st. petersburg
mr. putin be the featured speaker at the gala opening of the gleam mariinsky ii theater in may when he also award mr. gergiev a recently revive soviet era prize the hero of labor award
mr. gergiev and ms. netrebko be vocal supporter of mr. putin 's 2012 presidential campaign
the met while express its displeasure with the law have resist the idea of dedicate opening night to anything 1 2 next page
athens
the perfect political storm for violent extremism have descend on greece
it consist of national humiliation economic disaster high immigration political division and international tutelage
look no further than weimar germany to understand its ingredient
in the subdued street of the greek capital where a vague menace hang like a pall temper be frayed
the economy be turn slowly after draconian cut and two bailouts total â¬240 billion but not enough yet to be feel
the cry of the extreme right resounds we the father of civilization have be sell out by the international loan shark
these be familiar insinuation
it be well known where they can lead
the neo nazi golden dawn party be rise from a negligible fringe group in 2009 to what be almost certainly the country 's third political force today represent close to 15 percent of the vote accord to poll
if the most acute phase of greece 's economic crisis have pass the most acute phase of its political trial be upon it
i have little doubt that if greece be not part of the european union with the protection and example afford by this much malign democratic club it would have tumble into catastrophe by now much as a humiliate germany do after 1918
europe have be greece 's protector even as the single euro currency have be its tormentor
a typical confrontation occur the other morning
alex soultos who work in the jewelry business be in a shouting match
a graduate of northeastern university who return to athens from boston in 2009 he be make his way through a crowd of striker outside the ministry of administrative reform and e governance when he lose it
you should be work instead of block the road
he scream his american work ethic boil up
his business be in a downward spiral in an economy that have shrink by a quarter
a group of woman scream abuse back at him
at our age they demand where can we find job
they be among the 2,000 school guard who be oust as the government scramble to find 12,500 public employee it could shift by the end of this month to meet a deadline set by greece 's international creditor
we have bill vespina papadopoulou shout
but as kyriakos mitsotakis the minister responsible for the cut explain to me inside the besiege ministry the message from the troika the international monetary fund the european commission and the european central bank be clear if you do not do it no more money
europe 's requirement be reform or else
greece with an estimate $ 3.3 billion shortfall in its social security fund this year and a large financing gap loom over the next two year still need money if much less than before
more urgently it need international understanding
the combination of the demand of the troika widely see by greeks as a trojan horse for germany and the frustration evident outside the ministry soultos 's private sector have lose close to 1.5 million job as unemployment have reach 28 percent be combustible
i watch antonis samaras the conservative prime minister give an impassioned speech this week in which he speak of the way democracy breed its own enemy which be basically extremism
he warn that greece be in the blind spot before improvement be feel a few crucial month that be not the most difficult but be the most politically sensitive
golden dawn have be on a rampage
the police say one of its activist be responsible for the stab to death this week of pavlos fyssas a leftist hip hop singer who have denounce the party
in recent week golden dawn supporter have manhandle a mayor try to honor victim of the civil war and attack communist party sympathizer leave nine hospitalize
samaras be squeeze between the demagoguery of this rampant right and the populism of the left wing anti austerity syriza party which be promise to restore most if not all of what have be lose since greece in the local phrase fall from the cloud
troika official will visit athens next week
if they make further demand for cut in wage and pension they could push greece over the edge
germany have not yet learn to play the benign superpower
it be time and after the german election this sunday there may be a little more wiggle room
toughness toward greece have play well in germany but as mitsotakis put it the country have be stretch to its limit
this need to be very very clear
in fact of course germany have also save greece from bankruptcy
it do so for the european union which help usher germany from its cataclysmic zero hour of 1945
through europe germany come back
through europe greece have be save from the fate of weimar
at a time when pettiness surround think about the e.u. and the assumption be widespread that the union 's peacemaking role be over it be critical to recall that the union be europe 's sure safeguard against the continent 's dark hour

when the brooklyn democratic establishment gather for breakfast at junior 's a few day after the primary election most eye be on bill de blasio the presumptive nominee for mayor who doled out hug and kiss as he navigate the room
but in the background several member of the city council none of them from brooklyn be also work the crowd
as guest din on egg and lox mark s. weprin from queens annabel palma from the bronx and daniel r. garodnick from manhattan whose wife have give birth to the couple 's second son day before make their way to each table shake hand and greet people with
hey how be you and great to see you
there be no need to explain why they be there
the unsaid thing be that they 're all run for council speaker frank r. seddio the chairman of the brooklyn democratic party say later
the speaker of the council elect by the member be arguably the second most influential official in the city and the position will become vacant in january when the current speaker christine c. quinn leave office after her defeat in this year 's race for the democratic nomination for mayor
ms. quinn who be elect speaker in 2006 defeat bill de blasio who last week defeat her in the primary bring a new forceful power to the post and impose discipline on a panel that have previously be view as unruly
she use her position to block legislation that she often in alliance with mayor michael r. bloomberg oppose and likewise to rally vote for legislation that she support
the election to replace her will not take place until january after the member elect in november take office
but the campaigning have be under way for month and have intensify since last week 's democratic primary since if history be any guide almost all member of the council will be democrats
by tradition county party organization play a significant role in the election of the speaker in some instance essentially dictate vote after horse trading involve committee chairmanship and patronage job
and ideology play a role too although the post will be choose by democrats some of the council 's democratic member be significantly more liberal than others
the choice be complicate as so many thing in new york city politics be by gender and race
although white make up a minority of the city it appear highly likely that the next mayor will be a white man both the democratic and republican nominee be white man and also likely that the next comptroller will be a white man the democratic nominee be heavily favor
the outcome of the race for public advocate the only other elect citywide post be unclear there will be a democratic runoff between a black woman and a white man on oct. 1 there be no republican candidate
if there be no black or latino on the democratic ticket i think there will be a lot of pressure to pick a minority member for speaker george arzt a veteran democratic political consultant say
you can not have four white man
multiple member have be mention as candidate in addition to mr. weprin mr. garodnick and ms. palma they include james vacca of the bronx inez e. dickens and melissa mark viverito of manhattan and jumaane d. williams of brooklyn
mr. williams who be african american say in an interview that pick a member of a minority group as speaker should be a priority
i think that be something that should be push he say
beyond ethnicity all of the candidate have strength and weakness
ms. dickens be a close ally of ms. quinn which could be a problem for her if mr. de blasio choose to get involve in the race
she have also be the subject of several negative story in the new york post recently about her role as a landlord in harlem
mr. garodnick who have originally plan to run for comptroller this fall withdraw his candidacy after scott m. stringer the manhattan borough president decide to drop his mayoral bid and run for comptroller instead
that may have earn mr. garodnick some good will with mr. stringer 's allies include representative jerrold nadler of manhattan 1 2 next page

six month into his papacy pope francis send shock wave through the roman catholic church on thursday with the publication of his remark that the church have grow obsess with abortion gay marriage and contraception and that he have choose not to talk about those issue despite recrimination from critic
his surprising comment come in a lengthy interview in which he criticize the church for put dogma before love and for prioritize moral doctrine over serve the poor and marginalize
he articulate his vision of an inclusive church a home for all which be a striking contrast with his predecessor pope benedict xvi the doctrinal defender who envision a small pure church
francis tell the interviewer a fellow jesuit it be not necessary to talk about these issue all the time
the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church be not all equivalent
the church 's pastoral ministry can not be obsess with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrine to be impose insistently
we have to find a new balance the pope continue otherwise even the moral edifice of the church be likely to fall like a house of card lose the freshness and fragrance of the gospel
the pope 's interview do not change church doctrine or policy but it instantly change its tone
his word evoke gratitude and hope from many liberal catholics who have feel leave out in the cold during the papacy of benedict and his predecessor john paul ii which together last 35 year
some lapse catholics suggest on social medium a return to the church and leader of gay right and gay catholic group call on bishop to abandon their fight against gay marriage
but it leave conservative and traditionalist catholics and those who have devote themselves to the struggle against abortion gay marriage and artificial contraception on the defensive though some cast it as nothing new
nobody should try to use the word of the pope to minimize the urgent need to preach and teach about abortion say the rev. frank pavone national director of priests for life who say he speak thursday about the priority of the abortion issue at a vatican conference
the interview with francis be conduct by the rev. antonio spadaro editor in chief ofâ
la civiltã cattolica an italian jesuit journal whose content be approve by the vatican
francis the first jesuit to become a pope agree to grantâ the interview after request from father spadaro and the editor of america a jesuit magazine base in new york
father spadaro conduct the interview during three meeting in august in the pope 's spartan quarter in casa santa marta the vatican guesthouse where francis say he have choose to live because it be less isolated than the papal apartment in the apostolic palace
i can not live without people francis tell father spadaro
the interview keep under wrap for week by the jesuits be release simultaneouslyâ on thursdayâ morning by 16 jesuit journal around the world
francis personally review the italian transcript and it be translate by a team into english say the rev. james martin an editor at large ofâ america
we have a great pope say father spadaro in a phone interview from his office surround by italian journalist
there be a big vision not a big shift
his big vision be to see the church in the middle of the person who need to be heal
it be in the middle of the world
the pope 's word be likely to have repercussion in a church whose bishop and priest in many country include the united states have often seem to make combat abortion gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priority
francis say that those teaching have to be present in a large context
i see the church as a field hospital after battle francis say
it be useless to ask a seriously injure person if he have high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugar
you have to heal his wound
then we can talk about everything else
from the outset of his papacy in march francis who be 76 have choose to use the global spotlight to focus on the church 's mandate to serve the poor and oppressed
he have wash the foot of juvenile prisoner visit a center for refugee and hug disabled pilgrim at his audience
his pastoral presence and humble gesture have make him wildly popular among american catholics accord to a recent pew survey
â
but there have be a low rumble of discontent from some catholic advocacy group and even from some bishop who have take note of his silence on abortion and gay marriage
this month bishop thomas tobin of providence r.i. tell his diocesan newspaper that he be a little bit disappointed in pope francis because he have not speak about abortion
many people have notice that he say
the interview be the first time francis have explain the reasoning behind both his action and omission
he also expand on the comment he make about homosexuality in july on an airplane return to rome from rio de janeiro where he have celebrate world youth day
in a remark then that produce headline worldwide the new pope say who be i to judge
at the time some question whether he be refer only to gay in the priesthood but in this interview he make clear that he have be speak of gay man and lesbian in general 1

these excerpt be from the full interview publish in english by america magazine a jesuit weekly base in new york
in his most extensive and revealing interview since he be elect in march pope francis sit for a series of talk in august with a fellow jesuit the rev. antonio spadaro the editor of the lead jesuit journal in rome
the pope formerly a cardinal jorge mario bergoglio speak of the mistake he feel he make when he become the superior of his jesuit province in argentina at the crazy young age of 36
he talk about his vision of the church and why he have choose not to spend much time talk about abortion gay marriage and contraception
he explain what he mean by the headline grab remark he make about gay people who be i to judge
and he say that doubt be essential to find god
laurie goodstein who be jorge mario bergoglio
i be a sinner
this be the most accurate definition
it be not a figure of speech a literary genre
i be a sinner
why do you become a jesuit a member of the society of jesus
three thing in particular strike me about the society the missionary spirit community and discipline
and this be strange because i be a really really undisciplined person
but their discipline the way they manage their time these thing strike me so much
what do you learn in your early experience as superior of the jesuit province in argentina
my authoritarian and quick manner of make decision lead me to have serious problem and to be accuse of be ultraconservative
i live a time of great interior crisis when i be in cordova
to be sure i have never be like bless imelda but i have never be a right winger
it be my authoritarian way of make decision that create problem
what should the church say to divorce and remarry people and homosexual
in buenos aires i use to receive letter from homosexual person who be socially wound because they tell me that they feel like the church have always condemn them
but the church do not want to do this
during the return flight from rio de janeiro i say that if a homosexual person be of good will and be in search of god i be no one to judge
by say this i say what the catechism say
religion have the right to express its opinion in the service of the people but god in creation have set us free it be not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person
a person once ask me in a provocative manner if i approve of homosexuality
i reply with another question tell me when god look at a gay person do he endorse the existence of this person with love or reject and condemn this person
we must always consider the person
what kind of church do you dream of
we can not insist only on issue relate to abortion gay marriage and the use of contraceptive method
this be not possible
i have not speak much about these thing and i be reprimand for that
but when we speak about these issue we have to talk about them in a context
the teaching of the church for that matter be clear and i be a son of the church but it be not necessary to talk about these issue all the time
the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church be not all equivalent
the church 's pastoral ministry can not be obsess with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrine to be impose insistently
we have to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church be likely to fall like a house of card lose the freshness and fragrance of the gospel
the proposal of the gospel must be more simple profound radiant
it be from this proposition that the moral consequence then flow
i say this also think about the preaching and content of our preaching
what should be the role of the vatican 's various department or congregation
they be instrument of help
in some case however when they be not function well they run the risk of become institution of censorship
it be amazing to see the denunciation for lack of orthodoxy that come to rome
i think the case should be investigate by the local bishop conference which can get valuable assistance from rome
these case in fact be much better deal with locally
the roman congregation be mediator they be not middleman or manager
what should be the role of woman in the church
i be wary of a solution that can be reduce to a kind of female machismo because a woman have a different makeup than a man
but what i hear about the role of woman be often inspire by an ideology of machismo
woman be ask deep question that must be address
the church can not be herself without the woman and her role
the woman be essential for the church
mary a woman be more important than the bishop
i say this because we must not confuse the function with the dignity
we must therefore investigate further the role of woman in the church
we have to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman
only by make this step will it be possible to better reflect on their function within the church
the feminine genius be need wherever we make important decision
the challenge today be this to think about the specific place of woman also in those place where the authority of the church be exercise for various area of the church
if encounter god be a journey then we can make mistake
if one have the answer to all the question that be the proof that god be not with him
it mean that he be a false prophet use religion for himself
the great leader of the people of god like moses have always leave room for doubt
you must leave room for the lord not for our certainty we must be humble

our life be not give to us like an opera libretto in which all be write down but it mean go walk do search see

we must enter into the adventure of the quest for meet god we must let god search and encounter us
if the christian be a restorationist a legalist if he want everything clear and safe then he will find nothing
tradition and memory of the past must help us to have the courage to open up new area to god
those who today always look for disciplinarian solution those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal security those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exist they have a static and inward direct view of thing
in this way faith become an ideology among other ideology
i have a dogmatic certainty god be in every person 's life
god be in everyone 's life
even if the life of a person have be a disaster even if it be destroy by vice drug or anything else god be in this person 's life
you can you must try to seek god in every human life
although the life of a person be a land full of thorn and weed there be always a space in which the good seed can grow
you have to trust god

in the way we structure the company i own 50 percent because i have the capital and i get the company up and run and they jointly own 50 percent
they say we do not think that ' fair anymore
we 're go to divide it equally and you 're go down to 20 percent
i say i do not think that ' what i be plan on
i do everything i could to talk them out of that but they be very resistant
i finally say look i have get a way that you can have 100 percent of the company
i leave and i go out and find a new set of partner and do a complete restart
i set really clear expectation with my next set of partner
q.
and your next company be
a. manhattan associates
it take me about five year to get to 30 people and then within three year we be 800 people and we go public
i stay with them until they be well over 1,000 people and then i decide want to do something new
q.
now you 're the chairman of airwatch
what have you learn about culture from run two big company
a.
start a company be a bit like watch a murder mystery movie
the first time you 're just try to figure out how it end
the second time you know how it end and you 're actually focus on the hint that the director be give you through the process
you 're much more focused on the style of the movie
q.
can you elaborate
a. with manhattan associates we be scale so quickly and we just keep hire people
we hire people who be a little bit too young
i find that it be easy for me to hire out of school and train the people i want as oppose to the people who be more set in their way
the problem be you can not run 800 people with a bunch of very young employee
we have kid with one year of experience who be manage people with six month of experience
there be a little bit of internal chaos when you 're grow that quickly because i would never do this before
q.
how be your leadership style evolve
a. i make every mistake you could possibly make
i be extremely autocratic
one of the reason we probably have a lot of young people be because i could tell young people what to do and they would not question it
if you bring in more senior people and tell them how to do their job they do not like that very much
i be not married and i have nothing else in my life and i do not have the view that anybody else have a life
why would you when you 're have this much fun build a company like this
it really be not until after the i.p.o. that thing start to slow down a little bit and we become more accept of different role different people and different way of managing
q.
so to use your metaphor you have have a chance to watch the movie a second time in your current role
tell me about that
a. we have grow from 100 people to 1,500 people in the past three year
you have get to build team that be organized
you have get to have different layer of management and skill set
you do not just take a salesperson and make them a sale manager because those be completely different skill
we still hire a lot of young people out of school
we do a lot of interview but we 're extremely selective
people want to be challenge in their interview
q.
so let 's talk about hire
how do the conversation go
a.
we ask how people feel about mobile
do they like it
how do they interact with their device
we want people who be passionate about this
we ask them if they feel lucky
we want people to feel lucky because the harder you work the lucky you get
so people who work hard actually feel lucky
and i make the statement that i think there be three kind of people in this world
with the first you ask them to do something and they can not get it do
with the second type of person if you tell them what to do they will get the job do
there ' a third type of person you point them in the right direction and they will figure it out
we need that third type of person
q.
what other question do you ask a. you ask them to tell story
give me situation where you have do something creative
give me situation where there be a problem that you need to solve
give me a situation where you do not have the leadership tell you what to do but you have to go fix a problem
and then you just let them go from there
by ask really open ended question you get a good sense of not only how people answer question but also how they think
and i almost always ask somebody to take something that ' complicated and that they know really really well and explain it to me
i do not care what it be
can they put it in plain language and communicate it in clear and crisp and complete term
there ' just nothing more important than clear communication
be able to take the complex and turn it into simple that ' what we do for a living
it take a lot of technology to create the illusion of simplicity

several time in rush ron howard 's excitingly torqued movie set in the formula one race world the camera get so close to a driver 's eye that you can see each tremble lash
it ' a startlingly beautiful but also naked image partly because there ' no hiding for an actor when the camera get that close
in moment like these you 're no longer watch a performance with its layer of art and technique you have cross the border between fiction and documentary to go eye to eye with another person 's nervous system
mr. howard do not just want you to crawl inside a formula one racecar he also want you to crawl inside its driver 's head
specifically he want to get inside those of james hunt chris hemsworth and niki lauda daniel brã¼hl formula one titan and rival who in 1976 help push the sport into mainstream consciousness
well at least in much of the rest of the world formula one have long struggle in the united states
in 1976 when both man be in their late 20 they race after each other while chase the world championship over wet dry and terrifyingly gnarly track
tuck very much alone into open wheel machine that could easily have become coffin hunt and lauda cut corner and graze death lap after lap whoosh over racetrack city street and deceptively pastoral road into the sort of sport legend that translate only occasionally into good cinema
build for speed on and off the track hunt be the pretty one a tall blond british playboy who transcend his middle class background to become racing royalty the king james of newspaper headline
bear into a wealthy austrian family the short slighter and dark lauda be by contrast cruelly nickname the rat because of his pronounced overbite
the beaver would have be a more apt handle
hunt partied hard archival photograph inevitably show him bookended by woman his gaze nestle in their decolletage while lauda assume the role of the frosty teetotal tactician
they be an ideally match telegenic salable pair the heartthrob and the master gearhead whose difference in and out of their car put a playful at time anguish human face onto a sport story
it ' one that the screenwriter peter morgan strip down to its satisfying straightforward core
there be all sort of narrative that could be spin out of formula one include how life be sacrifice for profit
in 1994 ayrton senna become the last driver to die in a grand prix
it ' hard to believe though that even a down and dirty expose would be a fraction as entertaining as rush which distill the thrill of race into a clash of personality one nail bite face off a catastrophic accident and a wild comeback
enzo ferrari the ferrari founder who be call the saturn or devourer of his child because of the fatality during his tenure may have be more important to formula one than any driver but romance like rush do not belong to the owner they belong to the worker the grim one and the smile one the one with the death wish and the one with the gusher of champagne
shortly after the movie open hunt be walk barefoot into a hospital bleed from the nose while still in his racing suit
he ' a ravishing mess and his effect on the room which go immediately silent be unmistakably erotic
hunt james hunt he announce echo a familiar line
before long a nurse be at once dress his wound and undress the rest of him a seduction that ' as much about the audience 's pleasure as that of the character on screen
best know for play the comic book hero thor mr. hemsworth be pretty than the all too real man he play in rush
yet this surplus of beauty work for the role because the actor who hold the screen with the unconscious physical confidence of the truly lovely look like the star that james hunt become
the scene of hunt sauntering into a hospital also signal that for all the machine and money rush be a human story about body if one almost always in furious motion
it ' also about work about find a drive as they say in racing and keep it even after machine and people spectacularly fail
lauda who ' see buy his way into race with loan his family do not support his passion be not a natural physical specimen or showman like hunt
yet one of the movie 's deepen pleasure be how as the story slyly shift from one man to the other it peel back the arrogance encase lauda who ' so abrasive that it ' hard not to root against him even as mr. brã¼hl 's dexterous textured performance pull you close
london the song arrive late in the new musical charlie and the chocolate factory but when that familiar lilting melody begin audience come alive as at no other point in the show
during one performance this summer several people hum softly while others smile broadly as the mysterious chocolatier willy wonka step into his glass elevator and sing pure imagination the immensely tuneful number from the 1971 film willy wonka the chocolate factory
the show 's director sam mendes fear this would happen
he resist include pure imagination at first say he already feel haunt by the performance of gene wilder as wonka from the movie
he do not want his musical 's otherwise original score to be size up against the most beloved song from the movie
but now it be pure imagination more durable than an everlasting gobstopper that is haunt the $ 20 million musical
the show may well end up be remember as a cautionary tale for movie studio who want to make musical out of film and book in this case by roald dahl that be treasure by many
it ' a song you can not get out of your head say an audience member david reid of inverness scotland as he and his 12-year old son matthew stand outside the drury lane theater after the show
it ' quite hard to improve on that movie be not it
charlie the late theatrical effort by hollywood studio to cash in on movie property be face an uphill climb toward a major goal of its producer at warner brothers become a hit on broadway
the world premiere open here to sharply mixed review this summer include some harsh one a hindrance to any future broadway transfer let alone eventual profitability here or in new york or from road and international production that may follow
more damning than anything some critic declare that the most resonant song in the musical be not one of the 18 original number by the tony award winner marc shaiman and scott wittman hairspray but pure imagination the only tune import from the wilder movie
while mr. mendes 's musical have much else that be new a plot twist involve wonka play by the tony winner douglas hodge la cage aux folles for instance and an updating of charlie and the other four child with golden ticket the show nevertheless find itself struggle to compete with a ghost
i find it pretty difficult to un remember gene wilder while i be work on this but ideally people have to put aside the movie say mr. mendes himself the oscar win film director of american beauty and whose last picture be the james bond blockbuster skyfall
look we have see visual rendition of world on film that you be never go to get in theater the yellow brick road will only go to the back wall of the theater and wonka 's river of chocolate can never be match onstage mr. mendes add
you have to find magical solution to theatrical challenge and hope that the audience be open to them
no one be hop more than the show 's lead producer from warner brothers mark kaufman and raymond wu who take over the theatrical division in 2011 as part of a shake up after its broadway musical flop baby it ' you and lestat

the two man be bullish during a recent interview use their own superlative to describe the london production of charlie but they also say that the musical would be retool for broadway
a new york transfer have not be announce while the 2014 15 theater season be think to be the target the two man decline to say when it would happen
another musical base on a dahl book matilda be now run in london and on broadway it have have strong review and solid ticket sale in both market
the charlie producer say they be confident that matilda would not swamp them
every show and everyone deserve a second chance mr. kaufman say
plenty of show get review that be not favorable the first time out
our word of mouth be good and we 're play at 95 percent capacity which be a very good sign
several broadway producer who have come here to see charlie be lukewarm about its script and score and say they would not want to invest in any broadway transfer of the show
the producer would only disclose their reservation anonymously for fear of offend the artist involve
none have any easy solution to the show 's flaw but posit two idea
lack excellent review the show need to build into a box office sensation to justify a transfer to new york
and the producer could add more popular tune from the wilder film like the candy man or the oompa loompa song that accompany the little orange skinned man who work in the factory
but the warner brothers executive who have hear these suggestion wo not go there 1 2 next page

it be late august in martha 's vineyard a bright sunny day perfect for a farmer market
i arrive at 9 a.m. with chris fischer chef farmer guy who know everyone
mr. fischer who grow up on a farm here and have have a job since he be 9 look as if he grow up on a farm here and have have a job since he be 9
his dark weather skin wrinkly eye gray beard and crack callous hand belie a mere 33 year
mr. fischer a 12th generation islander be here to shop for the evening 's menu at beach plum inn and restaurant where he take over the kitchen four month ago and where as you may have hear the obamas recently have a date night lobster for him mussel for her accord to mr. fischer
the farmer market here in west tisbury be small but serve two entirely different need
the first be for vacationer bouquet of zinnia alpaca sweater gluten free muffin fresh ear of corn to throw on the rental house grill
then there ' the market that only the farmer themselves see
in this one the player know who have the best field green or who have a rough year
they pay each other in trade as often as in cash
there ' camaraderie and history and real friendship among them
at the whippoorwill farm stand mr. fischer grab more beet than any civilian could possibly need
next he haul an armful of basil plant from a man whose hair could only be describe as bozo the clown go brunette
at the tea lane farm stand we stop to inspect bucket of delicate papery flower be organize by a young cherubic looking woman
and finally i be introduce to a farmer name bob who hand mr. fischer two bag of potato
arrgh sorry bob say
i do not bring any today
bob make his own hooch mr. fischer explain
he usually bring me a bottle
scratch the surface of any vacation town and you will find the local
but on martha 's vineyard which have long be a popular getaway for northeasterners it ' only two and a half hour from boston by car and ferry local culture be particularly storied farmer cheesemakers coffee roaster and fisherman who have establish an ad hoc new england utopia
they know one another intimately date one another occasionally work the land rarely go to the beach and keep to the area know as up island
this pocket of martha 's vineyard actually the western side of the island revolve around chilmark and menemsha
it ' where resort give way to pasture and farmland and wildlife
it ' where you find century old farm run by 28-year old as well as lithe woman whom you may mistake for model or actress in new york or los angeles pick kale on bucolic 10-acre plot
it ' a bohemia that ' both real and not on one hand there be dairy farm and free roam turkey and people who barter vegetable on the other bill clinton play golf nearby and seth meyers just have his wedding here
mr. fischer cater tea lane farm do the flower and so on
and mr. fischer who run the famed beetlebung farm and who recently return to martha 's vineyard to helm beach plum in my opinion the best restaurant the island have ever lay claim to be at its center
but here ' the trick mr. fischer 's insider world the farm the food the storybook beauty be wide open to the public
the farm have unmanned stand on their driveway where fresh produce be sell
just leave your money in the cash box it ' the honor system
at beetlebung farm you can actually cut your own flower
other spot like tea lane farm and north tabor farm be not technically open to the public but the proprietor be usually happy to let you meet the animal especially this time of year when the tourist drift back home and the island empty out
mr. fischer 's approach to food come from his father albert
a former commercial fisherman albert imagine an only slightly trimmer wilford brimley teach his child to hunt fish forage and farm all before they hit puberty
we eat off the land albert say
live on this island you eat well
and then in a phrase that could be print on every beach plum menu he add food should be simple and fresh and you should be able to see your ingredient

tom delay be the very symbol of congressional power and in the view of his detractor excess
his political career collapse in 2005 when mr. delay a texas republican who be the house majority leader be indict on money laundering charge that result in a three year prison sentence
but mr. delay 's long and colorful life take another turn on thursday as a texas appeal court throw out the november 2010 verdict rule that what he be convict of laundering corporate contribution to divert money to elect republicans to the state legislature do not violate any state law
mr. delay as it turn out be in washington at a luncheon with his former republican colleague when the decision be announce
the former congressman know as the hammer for a political style that embrace hard edge political tactic and a relationship with washington lobbyist that invite scrutiny from prosecutor be nothing short of jubilant praise god and belittle democrats and prosecutor for make such an effort to go after him
i just thank the lord for carry me through all of this mr. delay tell reporter as he leave a meeting of the texas republican delegation
it really drive my detractor crazy because i have the joy of jesus in me and they do not understand it the decision by the third court of appeals which vote 2 to 1 on party line be the late time that a high profile prosecution of an elect official invoke unusual legal theory have be stymie by an appeal court or stumble in the legal process
others who avoid conviction or have them overturn include former senator john edwards of north carolina and former senator ted stevens of alaska
from the start many republicans have denounce this prosecution as politically motivate overreach
still give the long list of ethical question that have cloud mr. delay 's career the former congressman say he have spend nearly $ 12 million on legal bill fend off everything from the congressional ethic committee to the department of justice the decision appear to fall short of a complete ethical cleansing
when he step down as majority leader in 2005 and later decide not to seek re election from his district in sugarland mr. delay now 66 face not only the indictment in texas but also an investigation by the department of justice into his relationship with jack abramoff a lobbyist at the heart of an ethic investigation
the justice department never bring charge against mr. delay for among other thing accept gift from mr. abramoff like a 10-day golf trip to scotland and england for mr. delay his wife and some staff member
mr. delay 's lawyer brian w. wice say that the investigation have ruin his life in large part but that mr. delay view the decision as a vindication a chance to restart his career
now that this sword of damocles have be remove i would think he could do almost anything he want to do he say
mr. delay have be free on a $ 10,000 bond
he have be anything but low profile deliver speech offer consulting advice write a blog and in a career turn that may have eclipse his work in washington appear on dance with the stars while wear a vest with leopard trim
they never get rid of me mr. delay say
you may see my shadow or footprint around over the last seven year
i have be active
mr. delay be convict with two associate of funnel $ 190,000 in corporate contribution through the republican national committee to republicans run for the state legislature in 2002
the election have national implication mr. delay be look to lock in republican control of the legislature as it prepare to redraw congressional district line
and after that election republicans in texas push through a redistricting plan that markedly change the playing field in favor of republicans strengthen mr. delay 's control in washington
this be the first time that prosecutor in texas have attempt to use a money laundering statute against a politician charge with try to circumvent the state ban on corporate contribution that have be in place since 2003
mr. delay never deny he engage in the practice describe in the indictment but say they be common and legally accept campaign practice
in its decision the court flatly reject the case bring against him
the evidence be legally insufficient to support delay 's conviction justice melissa goodwin write for the majority
the fundamental problem with the state 's case be its failure to prove proceeds of criminal activity
the travis county district attorney 's office say it be consider whether to appeal to the full texas court of criminal appeals
we be concerned and disappointed that two judge substitute their assessment of the fact for that of 12 juror who personally hear the testimony of over 40 witness over the course of several week and find that the evidence be sufficient and prove delay 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the office say
mr. wice who describe himself as a close friend and a consigliere to mr. delay i 've be do this for 30 year and you want to win them all but i never want to win one more than this one say that he do not expect the appeal court to overturn the decision and that he think it unlikely they would even take it up
i 've clerk at that court i have follow it since the truman administration he say
i be confident that they be not go to look at the case
you do not need to be a legal genius to see that the money laundering statute do not apply here
as he talk to reporter mr. delay trace his problem back to 1995 when the democratic congressional campaign committee begin file ethic charge against him
i have raise and spend on legal fee over that period over $ 12 million he say
but that ' what they want to do they want to destroy me

milan the paint face star down from the wall in ecstasy anger sadness all woman of course for these be mural by artist from jeanne detallante 's beauty masks to gabriel specter 's colourful women
and this be a show by miuccia prada
i want to do such beautiful dress but i want to express the fight that have to be very visible say ms. prada backstage
i struggle to do it
i personally love it
and i try to make it interesting at least from my point of view
interest the dress be colorful and extraordinary illuminate not just by the bold face print digitally over the low body of a wool or fur coat but also smother in sequin especially rhinestone brassiere build in at the bosom
with the vivid green red yellow and blue color the knee high sporty leg warmer and sometimes colored feather in the hair the effect be tribal
but there be also an unexpected feeling of the 1980 and those vivienne westwood external bra inspire by african woman
but ms. prada make everything her own
instead of the ugly aesthetic for which she be famed these clothes be weirdly beautiful
the vast head on the clothes or handbag seem to shout the story of this current decade look at me
it ' all about me
no other designer capture quite so forcefully in fashion the current female mind
the name myllokunmingia may not ring a bell but it be worth know
this 520-million year old creature be the size of a guppy with a tiny swordfish like fin run high over its back
the fossil it have leave behind preserve trace of a skull
human have a skull too
this and a number of other trait we share with myllokunmingia reveal it to be one of the old most primitive vertebrate yet find
it be in other word a hint of where we come from
myllokunmingia emerge during one of the most important phase in the history of life an evolutionary boom know as the cambrian explosion name for the geological period when it take place
over the course of about 20 million year the old know fossil of most of the major group of live animal appear reveal a rapid diversification of life that lead directly to human
it ' rapid in geological term but it ' probably not rapid to anyone who ' not a geologist say paul smith the director of the oxford museum of natural history
by some estimate the first animal evolve about 750 million year ago
but it ' not until around 520 million year ago that many major group of live animal leave behind their first fossil
for decade scientist have search for the trigger that set in motion this riot of diversity in the animal kingdom
recently dr. smith and his colleague david harper of the university of durham take a look at the hypothesis that have be offer about what cause the cambrian explosion
it become apparent just how many hypothesis there be out there dr. harper say
thirty plus over the past 10 year
the scientist find that many of those explanation have boil the cause down to just one trigger
geologist suggest geological cause
ecologist propose ecological one
many of those idea have merit dr. smith and dr. harper argue in a commentary in this week 's science but it ' a mistake to search for a single cause
they propose that a tangle web of factor and feedback be responsible for evolution 's big bang
long before the cambrian explosion dr. smith and dr. harper argue one lineage of animal have already evolve the genetic capacity for spectacular diversity
know as the bilaterians they probably look at first like little crawl worm
they share the precambrian ocean with other animal like sponge and jellyfish
during the cambrian explosion relatively mod change to their gene give rise to a spectacular range of body
but those gene evolve in bilaterians ten of million of year before the cambrian explosion put them to the test note dr. smith
they have the capacity he say but it have not be express yet
it take a global flood to tap that capacity dr. smith and dr. harper propose
they base their proposal on a study publish last year by shanan peters of the university of wisconsin and robert gaines of pomona college
they offer evidence that the cambrian explosion be precede by a rise in sea level that submerge vast swath of land erode the drown rock
there ' a big kick that correlate with the sea level rise dr. smith say of the fossil record
he and dr. harper propose that this kick happen thanks to the new habitat create by the sea level rise
these shallow coastal habitat be bath in sunlight and nourish with erode nutrient like phosphate
animal colonize these new fertile habitat dr. smith and dr. harper argue and evolve to take up new ecological niche
but these great flood also poison the ocean
the erosion of the coastline release calcium which can be toxic to cell
in order to survive animal have to evolve way to rid themselves of the poison
one solution may have be to pack the calcium into crystal which eventually evolve into shell bone and other hard tissue
dr. smith do not think it ' a coincidence that several different lineage of bilaterians evolve hard tissue during the cambrian explosion and not sooner
these shell and other hard tissue speed up animal evolution even more
predator could grow hard claw and jaw for kill prey and their prey could evolve hard shell and spine to defend themselves
animal become lock in an evolutionary arm race
this new ecological food web grow even more complex
big predator evolve that could eat small predator
meanwhile some bilaterians burrow into the sea floor for the first time allow oxygen rich seawater to flow into the sediment
those first burrowers profoundly transform the world 's ocean create yet another habitat that other oxygen breathe animal could also invade
that drive the diversification onward say dr. smith
kevin peterson a biologist at dartmouth praise dr. smith and dr. harper for point to the right way to study the cambrian explosion
we be long past identify single trigger for the event he say
dr. peters agree that take a holistic view of the cambrian explosion would lead to a better understanding of it
it 'll be a fun next decade he predict
but philip donoghue of the university of bristol do not think the link dr. smith and dr. harper use in their hypothesis be tight enough yet
question still remain for example about how long vertebrate and other animal group already exist before they leave behind fossil like myllokunmingia
if animal diversify earlier then scientist will need to look at earlier cause
timing say dr. donoghue be everything
in finding that be as scientifically significant as they be crush to the popular imagination nasa report thursday that its mars rover curiosity have deflate hope that life could be thrive on mars today
the conclusion publish in the journal science come from the fact that curiosity have be look for methane a ga that be consider a possible calling card of microbe and have so far find none of it
while the absence of methane do not rule out the possibility of present day life on mars there be plenty of microbe on earth at least that do not produce methane it do return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without any hopeful data to back it up
the history of human fascination with the possibility of life on mars be rich encompass myriad work of science fiction percival lowell 's quixotic effort to map what turn out to be imaginary canal orson welles 's panic induce 1938 war of the worlds radio play and of course bugs bunny 's nemesis marvin the martian
but marvin apparently do not emit enough methane for curiosity 's sensitive instrument to find him
you do not have direct evidence that there be microbial process go on say sushil k. atreya a professor of atmospheric and space science at the university of michigan and a member of the science team
but nasa scientist be go strictly by their data and they be leery about draw broad implication to the question once pose by david bowie
be there life on mars
john p. grotzinger the project scientist for the curiosity mission would go only so far as to say that the lack of this ga do diminish the possibility of methane exhaling creature go about their business on mars
it would have be great if we get methane dr. atreya say
it just be not there
curiosity which have be trundle across the planet for a little over a year make measurement from martian spring to late summer come up empty for methane
scientist have long think that mars warm and wet in its early year could have be hospitable for life and the new finding do not mean that it be not
but that be about three and a half billion year ago
methane molecule break apart over a few century victim of the sun 's ultraviolet light and of chemical reaction in the atmosphere so any methane in the air from primordial time would have disappear long ago
that be why report of huge plume of methane rise over mars in 2003 fuel fresh hope for martian microbe
those finding base on data from telescope on earth and a spacecraft orbit mars set off a surge of speculation and scientific interest
on earth most of the methane come from micro organism know as methanogen but the ga be also produce without live organism in hydrothermal vent
either possibility would be a surprising result for mars
after the 2003 methane reading a lot people get excite and start work on it say christopher r. webster of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif. and the lead author of the paper in science
it be a very important result because of the magnitude of methane
the fresh data from curiosity bring the earlier claim into question
not everyone be daunt
robert zubrin president of the mars society a nonprofit group dedicate to the planet 's exploration and settlement say he be still convinced that martian life be wait to be discover in underground aquifer
if it have find methane that would have be killer dr. zubrin say refer to curiosity
yes it ' disappointing in that we do not get a pony for christmas
but it do not mean there be not pony out there
one of the scientist who find the methane plume in 2003 michael j. mumma of nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt md. say in an interview this week he be certain that his earlier measurement be still valid
he say he now believe that methane on mars be episodic release in large plume and then quickly destroy
he suggest half jokingly that there could be huge colony of methane eat microbe on mars that eliminate the ga from the air
dr. mumma acknowledge that he could not identify any phenomenon that would explain why methane plume spurt out that year but not more recently or how methane could be destroy much more quickly on mars than on earth
mars may not be operate the same way he say
it ' a puzzle

in a way you have to forgive people of a certain age the writer david sedaris say recently
like when you watch the movie into the wild

it ' a smart drolly tell come of age story both mocking and indulgent of its narrator 's unearned righteousness of all the humiliation that accompany self discovery
with hope of acquire the film right to c.o.g. the writer and director kyle patrick alvarez attend one of mr. sedaris 's reading stand in line to meet him and then hand over a dvd of his first film easy with practice
i just put it in my bag mr. sedaris say
then i finish my tour and get back to england and think oh right this to tell you the truth i get a lot of thing like that
but i think well i will give it a try
and i just really really like it
i think it be such a unique and strangely beautiful little movie
he eventually say yes to mr. alvarez
c.o.g. which be release on friday by screen media and focus world be the first film adaptation of his work
mr. alvarez write the script
i do not at any moment think be i say yes to the wrong person mr. sedaris say
and when it come to movie he know a thing or two there be stretch he say when he go to see film as often as three time a week and repeat viewing sometimes dozen be not uncommon
on the phone from his home in england mr. sedaris speak about some of the film he ' watch the most
the only thing i ever walk out of be dr. doolittle with eddie murphy he say
it ' remarkable what i will sit through it really be
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 29 2013because of an editing error an article last sunday about the favorite film of the writer david sedaris misidentified the child actor show with dylan baker in an accompanying picture from the todd solondz film happiness
he be evan silverberg not justin elvin
the article also misidentified the distributor of c.o.g. a new film base on an essay by mr. sedaris
it be be release by screen media and focus world not by forty

milan high rise building in milan their metallic frame and glass window wink with the september sun have bring a new futuristic feeling to this city
the porta nuova business district be not just home this week to a financial initiative by the conde nast group to support artistic italian student
it have also be a fresh venue for forward look designer
across the spectrum of the italian spring/summer 2014 season be a yearning for modernity
however deep the heritage of a brand lead designer be look for the future not the past in style and technique
the main message from these early show be let there be light
that be the story at fendi where backstage silvia venturini fendi announce light be an inspiration before take a joint bow with karl lagerfeld in his 48th year at the helm of the brand
the show start with a gust of lightness dress in red organza the skirt blow out
the same material would appear later with cutout of shear mink add to the collection 's graphic modern feel
for all its ethereal effect the show be also rich in the famous fendi fur delicately use as light as feather tease into animal shape bag dangle as earring below the model japanese square cut hair and as fur ring embed with crystal
these accessory be from the new family fashion recruit the jeweler delfina delettrez fendi
the recent trajectory of fendi have be to a streamlined modernity and mr. lagerfeld achieve that by use the exceptional work of the couture fur atelier
with a new store opening this week on via montenapoleone and an exhibition in a historic cinema of fendi fur in film the brand be on a roll
maxmara have always be a no nonsense brand with a focus on coat but there be something almost monkish about the ultra plain finely cut outerwear over midcalf dress
both be in pallid neutral color although enrich with texture
this parade of plainness cover up poncho coat include go on to a fault until there be an injection of the same look in vivid color fuchsia purple orange and red
maxmara do a real service to woman make such clean clear well cut clothes
but an exploration of more subtle color like terra cotta blush pink and rain wash sky blue would have give a tinge of glamour
ennio capasa bring his costume national woman 's collection back from paris to his native italy
and it be to what the designer call a new milan the concrete basement of a soar glass and steel skyscraper
the switch of showplace and space inspire mr. capasa to take a fresh look at deconstruction and reassembly
so the collection have sharp tailoring and high tech material mix with craft tunic set at an angle tailoring apparently in weave linen contrast with a silvered finish suit to the skeleton of the hyper modern building
all the current minimalism in milan have a hint of celine today and of helmut lang from the past
but take a modern and streamlined route be an important move for designer in this city
to see the yin and yang in milanese design there be alberta ferretti turn to that perennial gift of summer flower
but her floral pattern have a touch of folklore as though peasant girl have cross stitch embroidery on white cotton
the south of italy meet south america say ms. ferretti backstage to explain the hot orange bougainvillea pink and ocean blue that punctuate the collection
the effect be pretty and girlish with dress that will attract loyal client who want to look feminine rather than feminist
but like those folkloric dance for the tourist this vision of local culture go on too long
with a galaxy of explosion as a backdrop and blownup image of nature on the perky summer clothes the just cavalli range be rich in digital pattern
the concept of animal skin with vegetable and floral pattern if not new make a fine splash of color and print
but why do roberto cavalli have to communicate this message by sexting the word for those suggestive image send via smartphones across cyberspace
mr. cavalli 's sexy message be clear from the first visible bra albeit with pretty print that fill an open front outfit
the theme go on with cut away curve on a summer dress reveal flesh at the side crop top bar the midriff and many more take on the visible brassiere
the just cavalli message seem to be welcome to the world of sea sand and yacht
and why not
but apart from some patterned pant and a few narrow strap dress these outfit seem too hot to handle in the workplace
with shoe so often center stage at the current show the shoe brand hogan have want to identify its clothing range
the total look as envisage by ã¼ber stylist katie grand be more tailor than usual and the foot of the model lounge in chair even have high heeled pump to compete with chunky boot
the trim leather jacket be an inspiration from the past
i think of a leather jacket my father loan me that i use to wear in the 1970
i take away the zipper and replace it with button say ms. grand who always make anything historic look immediately modern

despite face the dread san francisco 49er run defense lynch score three touchdown two rush rewarding owner who be brave enough to stick with him
it be a good reminder that sometimes fantasy owner can overthink the matchup and end up bench a player they draft in the first round
in general we preach that you should start the team you draft especially in the first few week of the season and that player who have unfavorable matchup should not be bench if they be of a certain caliber
lynch owner have it easy this week as he be up against the jacksonville jaguars
he be among our favorable matchup pick for week 3
if you have a tough lineup question for week 3 you can ask us on twitter
follow us at @5thdownfantasy
favorable matchup quarterback tony romo dal vs. st. louis
the rams secondary be off to a poor start allow an average of 350 yard pass and four total touchdown through the first two game
russell wilson sea vs. jacksonville
the jaguar have allow just 15 fantasy point per game to the position through the first two week but we be not buy that they have improve much consider they face alex smith and terrelle pryor
matthew stafford det vs. washington the redskins problematic secondary have be ransack for 72 fantasy point this season which be top in the league
stafford be a must start top five quarterback in week 3
ryan tannehill mia vs. atlanta the dolphins appear to have finally figure out a way to deploy their pricey new receiver mike wallace 9 rec

alex smith kc vs. philadelphia smith get a foul eagles secondary that make philip rivers 419 yard 76.7 percent completion rate 3 tds look like aaron rodgers last week
but smith be still the check down king rank 30th in the league in yard per pas attempt 5.66 which keep his upside ground in mid qb2 territory for week 3
run back reggie bush and joique bell det vs. washington bush 's availability for sunday be up in the air but if you handcuff him with bell you will be fine
whoever get the start should have a field day against a terrible redskins run defense that make the mediocre james starks 158 total yard 1 td one of the most popular waiver wire add this week
marshawn lynch sea vs. jacksonville you may have bench lynch against the dominant 49er defense only to be burn when he score three touchdown but he should be consider a top two fantasy run back this week in a dream matchup with the jaguars 31st rank run defense

he take on a detroit defense that have surrender the second most fantasy point to oppose back so far
knowshon moreno den vs. oakland
it seem strange refer to the raiders as a favorable matchup this week as they have give up just 6 fantasy point per game to oppose run back so far but take a look at the competition vick ballard and a struggle jaguars ground game
moreno will lead the mile high committee in snap for a third consecutive week and be an rb2/flex option this weekend
wide receiver mike wallace mia vs. atlanta wallace be free from his usual vertical downfield role last weekend which result in great number versus the colts

be you the person that we can ask question
or be you just a guard
if the visitor 's word sting jeffrey martinez he do not show it
after a summer protecting work by the artist james turrell at the guggenheim museum he have grow accustomed to rove throng of the baffle
fielding question be not his job as a guard but the questioner do not know that
they 'll come and say what ' go on
what be this?'â he say
and they will either shrug and move on or stay and be interested
the dark secret of this acclaimed show which close on wednesday be that it have mystify a lot of people whether or not they admit it
many do not understand what mr. turrell 's quadrilateral of light project onto dark background be about and why this show be such an art event
you see it in the visitor eye search the room for the likewise perplex
some spot a guard like mr. martinez sidle up with question
he always answer base on his own reading and on insight forage from his colleague
it be not the first time i would see guard at this exhibition which be short on explanatory label do the same
they be after all the only thing stand between many visitor and incomprehension or in the case of at least one regretful musing about the number of beer he could have have for the price of admission
if they 're go to pay $ 22 to get in they may as well know what it be mr. martinez say
but he bring to his brief and mod answer empathy not just for the visitor but also for the artist
after all he too be an artist a lifelong painter who know that his own work be unlikely ever to require guard but who have live for art all the same
tall and thick as a linebacker with eye that swell in conversation and just a dusting of buzz cut hair mr. martinez 47 be stand on a recent tuesday in the museum 's high gallery beside a turrell work title ronin a vertical corridor of light whose depth and source be its alluring mystery
one by one the visitor come saw become confused and very often seek the guard 's guidance
an elderly man who wish to be identify only as martin walk in and fail to notice the illuminate strip point instead toward an empty wall ask be this part of the exhibit
mr. martinez redirect the man 's eye toward the light and martin walk off to stand before it dutifully commune
this one i do not get he mumble
martin be there he say because of a friend who get on his nerve
the friend always find everything great wonderful amazing
martin thus avoid whatever the friend praise
the friend dislike the turrell show which make martin think this one must be good
now martin walk back to mr. martinez
so it ' an opening
he ask wonder where the light be come from
reassure that it be martin now declare that he would understand all along my perception be not usually that clear but it be immediately clear that it be a hole in the wall he say
not everyone need to understand
i be not try to get it i be try to experience it say carol hoffman 73 a mix medium artist from princeton n.j.
for her share bafflement be the point we 're with all these other people try to figure it out
the 4 p.m. rotation come and mr. martinez move to another room
he watch adult make shadow puppet in the project light of another turrell piece
a frenchwoman stroll past put a spin on the exhibition as trã¨ trã¨ trã¨s minimaliste
three chilean woman approach mr. martinez and in spanish ask the significaciã³n of a work that look a lot like someone have turn on a home projector without fire up the laptop
mr. martinez be careful to begin there ' no specific meaning but my own interpretation be he offer his standard turrell spiel this particular artist 's method be to play with your perception
no one want to be the person who do not understand and a moment later one of the woman declare herself enthralled beautiful precious very exciting

tokyo hiroshi yamauchi who transform his great grandfather 's playing card company nintendo into a global video game powerhouse die on thursday in kyoto japan
he be 85
the cause be complication of pneumonia the company say
mr. yamauchi who lead nintendo from 1949 to 2002 be japan 's most unlikely high tech success story
name president of the family business at 22 he steer nintendo into board game light emit toy gun and baseball pitching machine fruitless foray that he later attribute to a lack of imagination before the company arrive at arcade game
its donkey kong and the original mario bros. become hit and give rise to nintendo 's wildly successful home video game business
the nintendo entertainment system a console first release in japan in 1983 as famicom unseat early leader in the video game industry sell more than 60 million unit thanks to shrewd marketing close attention to product quality and a crop of game base on unlikely yet endearing character that soon become household name
in 1988 the new york times write many nintendo best seller like super mario bros. 2 be base on wildly preposterous premise note that the two mustachioed hero of that game endure various trial such as dodge hammer swing turtle and lava ball and man eat plant in order to save a mushroom princess
but the article conclude no matter
kid can not get enough of the game
under mr. yamauchi who profess not to understand video game nintendo go on to dominate the business
when a successor machine be release in 1990 fan camp outside electronics store for day in anticipation it sell almost 50 million unit
next come the nintendo 64 and nintendo game cube home console as well as game boy hand hold machine
nintendo dominate the list of all time top sell game
in the early 1990 mr. yamauchi find himself in the middle of an international dispute when he offer to buy a majority stake in the seattle mariners
the team establish in 1977 have be threaten to leave seattle if it could not find a new owner willing to keep it there
nintendo have its united states headquarters in seattle
the team 's owner approve the deal but the commissioner of major league baseball fay vincent and a four man m.l.b. owner committee initially oppose it
they relent and approve the sale in 1992 after mariners fan and the seattle news medium rally in favor of it
in 2001 the mariners sign the star japanese outfielder ichiro suzuki now with the yankees help to open the door for many more japanese player to join major league team in the united states
in a show of his characteristic detachment however mr. yamauchi confess at the time that he be not much interested in baseball either
he say he have never go to a baseball game and be think to have never go since
one of his few hobby be the japanese board game go which he play at the master 's level
hiroshi yamauchi be bear in kyoto on nov. 7 1927
he be raise by his grandparent after his father shikanojo yamauchi desert the family
the yamauchis have be maker of hanafuda card a japanese playing card game base on flower since 1889
once favor by the elite it become popular as a gambling game often play by japanese gangster
mr. yamauchi join the family business in 1949 after his grandfather have a stroke
he move quickly to take control at the company force out a cousin and later purge officer appoint by his grandfather
but the playing card business be in terminal decline and mr. yamauchi shift the company 's focus to one toy after another until he find success with video game in the 1980
he be help by the renowned video game designer shigeru miyamoto who join the company in 1977 and create mario donkey kong the legend of zelda wii and other product
mr. yamauchi develop a strategy that set him apart from other consumer electronics manufacturer in japan
from early on he farm out the production of nintendo 's video game machine to small supplier allow the company to maintain a relatively small staff and low overhead cost
nintendo approve only a handful of game each year whether design internally or by outside company ensure that price and profit margin remain high
there be some misfire under mr. yamauchi 's watch
the company 's cumbersome headache induce virtual boy portable console a red box on leg with rubber visor that player peer into to play game in 3-d be a flop
and begin in the late 1990 first sony then microsoft steamroll into the gaming market with new console the playstation and xbox respectively challenge nintendo 's dominance
mr. yamauchi step down in 2002 i have no energy leave he tell reporter and be credit with go outside the family to appoint a successor to steer nintendo through rocky time
under satoru iwata the current nintendo president the company roar back with its nintendo ds hand hold machine and the wii home game console though mr. iwata too have stumble with the most recent hardware release and be increasingly under siege by smartphone game
mr. yamauchi 's survivor include a son katsuhito
in one of his last interview with the magazine nikkei business in 2003 mr. yamauchi offer a longer view of the gaming market
at the time nintendo be be pummel by sony 's immensely popular playstation 2 console
but he scoff at suggestion that the battle for supremacy in gaming be over
that ' absolutely wrong the gaming war they will never end he say add that ' just not how this business work
nobody know what tomorrow will bring

kabul afghanistan taliban insurgent have reportedly capture or kill large number of afghan government force in the remote and usually quiet northeastern corner of the country for the second time this year official say thursday
accord to dawlat mohammad the governor of warduj district insurgent ambush a police convoy in the district on wednesday kill 10 policeman and take 16 others prisoner
a text message send to journalist from a taliban official claim that the insurgent have kill 25 policeman and capture 12
but on thursday the spokesman for the afghan interior ministry sediq seddiqi dispute both the insurgent claim and those of the warduj governor say no police officer have be capture
the dispute report be symptomatic both of an increase casualty rate among afghan force and grow government sensitivity about such information
last year afghan official report that afghan national army soldier be be kill at the rate of more than three a day while death of police officer be about six a day twice as high
by comparison coalition casualty have never reach two a day and be now few than one a day
while hard figure be scarce this year a number of public comment have suggest a significant increase in casualty on the government side
this month the newspaper the guardian quote gen. joseph f. dunford jr. the american military commander as say that afghan force be lose 100 a week
i 'm not assume that those casualty be sustainable general dunford be report to have say
if that trend continue it would represent a substantial increase over last year 's report 2,970 death for afghan security force include both police officer and soldier
on july 22 the interior minister gen. ghulam mujtaba patang address parliament during impeachment proceeding against him defend himself by say he have be preoccupy with the rise death toll
from march 21 up to now i swear to god 2,748 police have be martyr he say
afghan government official later dispute general dunford 's figure and general patang 's office issue a clarification say his number refer to wound as well as dead
mr. seddiqi say thursday that casualty figure have not yet be compile nationwide so he be not able to give number
i can say there have be a slight increase in the number of casualty he say
he attribute that to afghan authorities take on great responsibility as nato and the americans have less of a combat role run more operation and more aggressive one and prepare for election next year by try to improve security condition
i can not give you the exact percentage of that increase but it be slight he say
in wednesday 's episode mr. seddiqi insist that no policeman have be take prisoner in warduj district in badakhshan province
mr. seddiqi say the authorities there have be conduct an operation to clear taliban fighter from the area and have kill 47 insurgent in the district
he acknowledge that the police have sustain some casualty but decline to give detail until a briefing after the current operation be over
so far we have clear 90 percent of the district of the taliban 's presence he say
warduj district be also where the taliban kill one afghan soldier and capture 22 others in an ambush in march
after negotiation with tribal elder in the area six of the soldier be release unhurt but 16 others be kill by the insurgent
warduj district lie along the highway lead into the wakhan corridor an area of very high mountain border by china and pakistan

as dexter reach its final episode on showtime on sunday night the question be will he go or will he go
that be will the serial killer dexter morgan head off to happy retirement in argentina with his family or end up in some kind of hell whether above or below ground
do the man we have watch plunge long knife into helpless victim for eight season require punishment no matter how charming and sometimes heroic he ' be
the proper fate of the seemingly irredeemable hero be a hot topic in prime time right now with break bad play out a similar scenario in its fifth and final season which end on sept. 29
of course history tell us that these accounting can be ambiguous tony soprano freeze in his booth at the diner vic mackey consign to a desk job but reach for his gun
those finale of the sopranos and the shield suggest that dramatic value and the feeling of fan outweigh moral consideration when it come to end popular long run cable series and that a good hero be hard to kill off no matter how many people he ' kill himself
the endgame have a different importance though in dexter a more stylized and fanciful show with an even more single minded focus on its protagonist 's psyche
the question of dexter 's fate be bake into the gothic premise a psychopath train by his adoptive father a police officer to be an honorable killer dispatch only those who need killing
and the show 's mix of film noir and fairy tale seem to leave open the possibility of redemption and even a happy ending
the result be that for at least two and perhaps three season it have feel as if we would be in a long process of preparation for sunday night with story line whose primary purpose be to push dexter ever closer to an edge that keep recede as the show 's rating remain strong by premium cable standard
season 7 and 8 have be the show 's highest rat average 2.1 million to 2.2 million viewer
it have be a frustrating ride for those of us who love the show 's early season when it achieve an unusually happy balance of interesting long arc dexter 's progress toward humanity and his intense relationship with his foster sister the dedicated cop deb and snappy short term storytelling his season length battle with other serial killer and his dealing with his droll colleague in the homicide squad of the miami police
in addition to gore suspense and heartbreak include the authentically shocking murder of dexter 's wife at the end of season 4 dexter be also mark by its easygoing sunny vibe and its undercurrent of jab workplace humor
as the rest of the cable drama landscape grow increasingly grim and heavy handed it be a welcome respite like pick up a fast and punchy charles willeford novel miami blues say after slog through a well review pretentious literary mystery
even as the story have lose some of its steam in recent season it ' be worth stay around because of the cast begin with michael c. hall and jennifer carpenter as dexter and deb and include excellent support performance by david zayas c. s. lee and desmond harrington as cop who never quite figure out that their blood spatter analyst be murder people under their nose
ms. carpenter the fire to mr. hall 's ice in the show 's central relationship have suffer the most from the need to keep the show go last season deb kill an innocent a superior officer no less to protect her foster brother and have since be an uneasy partner in his plot
it ' a development that have strain credulity even in the hothouse context of dexter and the water be further muddy by her admission to a therapist that she be attract to her brother
it probably would have be better if none of these thing have happen which be to say that it would have be better if the show have wrap up by season 5 or 6
but here we be in season 8 and the good news be that the pace have pick up recently as you would expect
the icelandic actor darri ingolfsson step into the shoe of past guest star like john lithgow and jimmy smits have make the dexter doppelgã¤nger oliver saxon a chill worthy adversary
viewer who be up to date spoiler ahead will know that dexter 's decision to walk away from a kill ready himself mentally for that idyllic new life in argentina have have potentially tragic result
i will admit here that i have see the finale and know the answer to my initial question
i wo not give anything away except that i expect that it will be controversial prepare for a twitter storm around 9:45 p.m. on sunday and that while i do not buy everything in the episode i buy the end
you may or may not think that dexter 's final resting place be the one he deserve
but it work
frankfurt even though the federal reserve have decide to maintain its economic stimulus for now the recent behavior of global financial market and national economy show just how tricky it will be for the world to adjust to life without central bank painkiller
the mere prospect of a gradual decline in fed bond purchase in the united states push up borrowing rate in europe in recent month even as the european central bank be try to tamp them down with its own limited set of remedy
but whether in the united states europe or elsewhere the big dos of monetary stimulus of the sort the fed have be administer since the global financial crisis erupt five year can go only so far in heal sick economy
the withdrawal symptom as market have anticipate a fed tapering of the dosage include the fluctuation in currency value over the summer that add a new element of uncertainty for multinational company
and an investor exodus from develop country threaten to undercut the buying power of some of europe 's most important customer
although european stock rise thursday and market rate for government bond decline after the fed say it would continue dispense its stimulus at full strength a bit longer those movement be very likely only a temporary reprieve from disruptive force largely outside europe 's control
this be a deferral it ' not a cancellation say carl weinberg chief economist at high frequency economics in valhalla new york
high rate be come
now the question be what if anything policy maker outside the united states will do about it
in europe at least the early indication be not much
european leader be still too preoccupied with their own domestic political problem to act more aggressively to stimulate demand and promote job growth for the euro zone
they be too fractured and factionalized to take the action that be beyond the scope of the monetary policy of the european central bank like spend on common infrastructure or other joint project that may help put people and company back to work
and they seem to have run out of energy for further overhaul of the flawed architecture of the currency union include continue aggressive action to fix europe 's trouble bank
in germany the euro zone 's wealthy country chancellor angela merkel may be constrain even after election on sunday be behind her
that be because even though her christian democrats be likely to retain power poll on thursday show that alternative for germany a right wing party that want to dissolve the euro will probably get enough vote to win seat in parliament
meanwhile italy which still have one of europe 's big economy despite its debt problem be once again preoccupy with silvio berlusconi the former prime minister
despite his legal peril mr. berlusconi still have the political clout to disrupt the stability of the italian government
marco tronchetti provera chairman of the italian tire maker pirelli say by telephone that europeans need a clear signal that thing be get better so that they would be willing to start spend again
without a project to regain confidence it ' difficult to predict a strong recovery he say
but he be pessimistic about the ability of european leader to act
what we need be a simple and more effective euro which mean strong integration with bureaucratic simplification mr. provera say
the decision make process in europe be too complex
the european economy have emerge from a recession that last a year and a half
but the growth have little momentum of its own and remain dependent on demand from abroad include the united states and develop country like china and brazil
as a result the euro zone be acutely sensitive to policy make in washington over which it have little influence 1 2 next page
berlin germany 's race for parliament tighten thursday three day before election with fresh poll underline the difficulty that even the popular chancellor angela merkel face in build a win coalition
ms. merkel 's social democratic challenger peer steinbrã¼ck a classic center leftist who have deep experience in germany 's state and federal government urge his party to make the most of what it say be collapse support for the chancellor and her christian democrats
in three day you can be rid of them
mr. steinbrã¼ck tell a crowd gather in alexanderplatz in the heart of former east berlin accuse the merkel lead coalition of be the most quarrelsome useless and backward look government in modern german history
the chancellor herself mr. steinbrã¼ck charge have give no direction in the past four year
instead she prefer to drive around in circle like a caged tiger at the berlin zoo he add
two poll publish thursday show that ms. merkel 's coalition have a narrow lead ahead of sunday 's vote
accord to a telephone survey for the public television network zdf the chancellor 's center right party be back by 40 percent of voter while its partner the business minded free democrats be support by 6 percent
the center leave social democrats earn the backing of 27 percent of voter while their prefer partner the greens earn 9 percent
the poll survey 1,369 voter on tuesday and wednesday and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage point
another survey conduct by insa for the newspaper bild zeitung show that ms. merkel 's party have the support of 38 percent of voter and the free democrats have the backing of 6 percent
support for the social democrats and greens be consistent with the zdf poll at 28 percent and 8 percent respectively
alternative for germany which reject the euro garner 5 percent compare with 4 percent in the zdf survey pass the 5 percent threshold would make it a surprise entry into parliament
the poll survey 2,248 voter by telephone from sunday to wednesday and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage point
both major party insist that germany 's future be firmly in europe have rule out a coalition with alternative for germany
if the anti euro party do get into parliament it could reduce the number of seat ms. merkel 's coalition receive force her to forge a so call grand coalition with the social democrats
that would match the coalition that govern in her first term when mr. steinbrã¼ck be finance minister and the pair together guide germany through the 2008 financial crisis
and it would potentially make mr. steinbrã¼ck a major player in the next phase of germany 's leadership whether his party win or not
mr. steinbrã¼ck 66 have say that he will not be part of another grand coalition
but it be increasingly clear that he would like to be part of negotiate whatever program the two big party can thrash out
the uncertainty of the outcome mean that the european union which have be hold its breath as the german vote near be likely to wait a few more month before learn where berlin would like to guide the troubled continent
mr. steinbrã¼ck a bright but sometimes bluster politician be regard as a strong alternative to ms. merkel 59 when he declare his candidacy a year ago
almost immediately however he start to stumble first over disclosure that he have receive $ 1.7 million for speech and writing then over whether politician be pay enough and next over a suggestion that he would never buy cheap wine
his party which be still divide over a legacy of labor and welfare overhaul that it initiate when last in power under ms. merkel 's predecessor gerhard schrã¶der be slow to get its campaign roll
even as late as july mr. steinbrã¼ck seem a somewhat reluctant slogger on the trail
since his lone television debate with ms. merkel on sept. 1 from which he emerge look as if he could be chancellor mr. steinbrã¼ck have take to campaigning with zest
in a format that be unusual for german election campaign which tend to be script and repetitive he have hit the road with a strategy call plain talk in which citizen sit around him as he field their write question filter through a moderator but not obviously prepared
mr. steinbrã¼ck who once govern germany 's most populous state north rhine westphalia have one of the ready wit on the campaign trail
i 'll start off answer your question and then i think it ' a 120-minute election speech and i will read it to make it even more boring he say as he take the stage one evening in munich last week with barely 1,500 supporter shiver through his presentation
he have regularly accuse the news medium of write his political obituary in advance remind a television interviewer on aug. 30 that in soccer a national passion here it ' not a matter of the first 20 minute but of the last 10 as to who win
i be amazed at how many people in your profession have already write their ready commentary he add
mr. steinbrã¼ck become a national topic of conversation last weekend when the magazine of the newspaper sã¼ddeutsche zeitung show him give his middle finger in reaction to an interviewer who have ask him to respond to unkind nickname attach to him during the campaign
the photo be from late july when mr. steinbrã¼ck be far behind the chancellor in personal popularity poll
he still trail but by less
many germans say that even if they do not share ms. merkel 's center right politics they believe that she have do a good job of guide the nation to relative prosperity in europe handle the euro crisis and reduce unemployment
her party which in the last two election saw its support drop just ahead of the actual vote have make ms. merkel the center of its campaign
since her free democratic partner make a poor showing in bavarian state election last sunday she have appeal directly to voter appear on national television late wednesday to urge people to cast both their vote for district candidate and party list for her and the christian democrats
that she be tell germans be the only way to guarantee she stay in charge
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 19 2013an earlier version of this article misquote remark by peer steinbrã¼ck to an audience in munich last week.â
he say jokingly that he would give a 120-minute election speech not a 20-minute election speech
washington the obama administration on thursday expand its effort to curtail severe penalty for low level federal drug offense order prosecutor to refile charge against defendant in pending case and strip out any reference to specific quantity of illicit substance that would trigger mandatory minimum sentencing law
the move announce by attorney general eric h. holder jr. at a speech before the annual conference of the congressional black caucus build on a major policy change he unveil last month to avoid mandatory minimum sentencing law in future low level case
by reserve the most severe prison term for serious high level or violent drug trafficker or kingpin we can better enhance public safety mr. holder say
we can increase our focus on prove strategy for deterrence and rehabilitation
and we can do so while make our expenditure smarter and more productive
the policy apply to defendant who meet four criterion their offense do not involve violence the use of a weapon or sell drug to minor they be not leader of a criminal organization they have no significant tie to large scale gang or drug trafficking organization and they have no significant criminal history
on thursday the justice department order prosecutor to apply the new policy retroactively to defendant who be already in the system but have not yet be sentence
it be not immediately clear how many pending federal drug case would be affect
in case where a defendant have be charge but guilt have not yet be determine prosecutor will be direct to file replacement criminal complaint to eliminate reference to specific quantity of drug that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence be the defendant to be convict accord to a three page justice department memorandum from mr. holder to federal prosecutor
mr. holder 's memorandum say that for case in which a defendant have already be find guilty but no sentence have yet be impose prosecutor have discretion about whether to apply the new policy
they be encourage to apply the policy in guilty plea case where legally and practically feasible he write but they should generally not seek relief for a defendant who choose to go to trial
the memo portray the policy as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and direct justice department official to fight any motion by a convict but not yet sentence defendant to seek relief without the government 's consent on the basis of the new policy
the memo also say prosecutor should not disturb the sentence in a case in which sentence have be impose
the justice department policy follow effort pioneer in state include conservative lean texas and south carolina to control soar taxpayer money that be spend to incarcerate huge number of nonviolent offender
still those change be approve by state legislature
by contrast the obama administration be undertake its move without wait to see whether congress will approve legislation to restore great leeway to judge in sentencing
the wave of change come as crime have plummet to the low level in four decade lead to a bipartisan pendulum swing against the tough on crime policy impose a generation ago amid the crack cocaine epidemic
those policy result in an 800 percent increase in the number of prisoner in the united states at a time when the national population grow by only a third
mr. holder have repeatedly criticize the moral impact of the nation 's high incarceration rate emphasize that while the united states have only 5 percent of the world 's population it have 25 percent of its prisoner

piscataway n.j.
two year ago paul james could not get a single division i football program to notice him
he spend college sign day in 2011 sitting in class at glassboro high school in south jersey
his coach work the phone furiously hop for a late break
the fax machine stay silent
it really hit me james say
like wow i have nothing go for me.'â more than four dozen other prospect from new jersey include run back savon huggins sign letter of intent that day a glut of talent that rutgers help corral
to james rutgers official offer this show up on june 25 and we will give you a walk on spot
since then james have replace huggins as the scarlet knights start run back and after three astonishing game he lead the football bowl subdivision with 493 rushing yard an average of 8.1 yard per carry
when rutgers 2 1 host arkansas at high point solutions stadium on saturday james will receive the bulk of the carry
but he be not the team 's only contribute walk on
michael burton a fullback will be block for him in what rutgers believe to be the only nonscholarship start backfield for a major college in the country
they be the no star tandem an improbable twosome in an era when recruiter net be cast wider and wider
an overlooked talent will occasionally amble onto a roster and emerge as a sensation as dominique whaley do at oklahoma not long ago when he arrive as if bear from a cloud of dust
but in new jersey
it just show what we overcome james say
we both come in as walk ons and it show how strong we be to get to this point and how hard we have to work to keep it as be
burton grow up in long valley n.j. as a die hard rutgers fan attend summer camp on campus as a high school junior and senior
but burton who be an oversize 220-pound run back say college seem hesitant
he say he have offer from low tier program like towson new hampshire and maine but only marginal recruiting interest from his top choice rutgers
instead like james he be extend a lukewarm invitation come to practice and see if you can stick
there be never any guarantee in life you have to prove yourself every single day burton a redshirt junior say
i use that as motivation
james and burton be so call preferred walk ons prospect whom the coach staff notice and like but do not offer scholarship
it be not the low rung on the college sport ladder but the ground be mighty close
burton and james begin as practice pawn and member of the scout team often line up against the first team defense and mimic what another team may run
they be in the dredge of the team 's depth chart
but eventually the coaching staff take notice
we do not really talk about be walk ons burton say
we 're out there try to win game
how do so many program miss the speedy james who have six touchdown in three game
different player end up in different situation for different reason rutgers coach kyle flood say
from what i understand he have some injury issue his senior year of high school
i think when coach see that they be probably less likely to invest a scholarship at that point in a player
james sustain a high ankle sprain in the third quarter of the first game of his senior year after rush for 1,730 yard for tiny glassboro as a junior
that fall college have begin to show interest tulane marshall east carolina temple and even penn state james 's top choice
but the ankle injury the next season halt his momentum
he miss two game and then begin lose playing time to corey clement a talented junior who wind up commit to wisconsin
james 's recruitment fall off
as his senior year kind of tick away a lot of those other school wind up kind of fall off greg maccarone the glassboro offensive coordinator say
two low tier college delaware and james madison remain interested in james as a defensive player and marshall and east carolina give him offer that quickly expire
he hedge and both scholarship be fill
so james wait until he could not wait any longer
he begin call college and send tape mining for a glimmer of interest
he visit the team close to home temple as well as rutgers that may. greg schiano then the coach of the scarlet knights tell him he could show up in june and have a roster spot but nothing else be guarantee
i could either look at it as an insult or an opportunity to grab james say
i could get in here and work my way up the food chain and get to where we want to be
if it all sound a bit like the movie rudy james say the thought have enter his mind too
if you 're a walk on if you do not have a scholarship if you be not highly recruit that ' how people look at you they will doubt you james say
you just can not let that get to you

norihiro ishizuka 70 stand alone wear not a crisp chef 's coat but a samue traditionally a monk 's work robe that slouch at his waist like a dress gown
he have a benevolent and slightly rakish air with his faint pencil mustache and white gray hair peek out of the bottom of his cap
he nod and grin already halfway to a laugh and the meal have not yet begin
outside kura 's east village shopfront be austere a blank wall crosshatch by the shadow of a fire escape with no sign save a linen drape hang in an archway ink with an unfinished circle
inside 12 seat line a blond wood counter
delicate jazz chime above
but this be not a shrine
behind mr. ishizuka be expose brick and the rough edge seem to suit him
no glass case separate him from diner instead fish be heap unceremoniously in a wide shallow basket
mr. ishizuka heft the fish up and slap it back down as if assemble sushi be a purely practical matter not require a soundtrack by philip glass
the great sushi chef of new york tend to be musical in their movement

mr. ishizuka be more of a tony bennett a crooner work the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand
he make sushi with substantial cut of fish tricky to eat in a single bite
alongside beautifully fresh kampachi tuna salmon and aji horse mackerel may be aka uni the large sweeter red sea urchin from the channel islands off california scallop balance on a band of nori over rice and saba mackerel present kyoto style fish and rice roll together in cloth and cut like slab of cake twice the height of ordinary sushi
keep in mind those rough edge
one evening the vein of fat in marble otoro be more resistant than yield ikura salmon roe be unchecked in its saltiness tamago a block of egg scramble with sugar sake and dashi be sweet without nuance
these seem less like misstep than choice come from a fondness for more direct flavor
soy sauce be provide but no wasabi
you will not miss it
instead there be tip of finger lime to be rub on the fish until their tiny juice sac squeeze out look like pale green roe and burst tartly in the mouth
all meal be omakase start at a reasonable $ 65 for 10 piece of nigiri and a hand roll which mr. ishizuka hand to you across the counter with a flourish soup aka dashi perhaps deepen with long ferment black miso and an appetizer tuna snowcapped with sticky mountain yam and stipple with nori dust say or creamy orange ankimo monkfish liver under grate daikon saturate red by chile
also available be osaka style kappo cook dish attune to the season less formal than kaiseki
these may include sesame tofu which be not tofu at all but a perfect cold cube of ground white sesame paste its taste at once familiar and ethereal and tuna tail brush with an understated teriyaki sauce char and strew with miniature rice cracker pearl
mr. ishizuka come from japan to new york in the late 1980 to preside at umeda near gramercy park then decamp to a restaurant in michigan
one of his partner at kura huey cheng work for him there as a waiter a role that mr. cheng 24 reprises here along with help to make the sushi rice and finish the kappo dish in the back kitchen
one night mr. ishizuka offer everyone at the counter shiokara an izakaya snack of fermented squid gut
i have eat the dish before and still it take my breath away like down a jigger of seawater intensely salty and fishy sop yet crunchy
other diner wince and giggle nervously
mr. ishizuka lean over to an old japanese gentleman at the counter
for the young one he say and they laugh

joseph j. lhota face on thursday with another poll show him far behind bill de blasio in new york 's mayoral race propose hold weekly debate hop they may alter the dynamic of the contest
mr. lhota a republican say that the two city sponsor debate which be already schedule for late october be insufficient and that the man should face off in all five borough
i think it ' important that we go out to the people and they see the contrast between the two of us he say in an afternoon news conference on the step of city hall add we have two very very different philosophy

mr. de blasio speak to reporter in the bronx do not accept or reject mr. lhota 's proposal
we be go to figure out the best way to go about debate and most importantly the televise debate program where most people have the opportunity to see the contrast between the candidate and you will see plenty of contrast say mr. de blasio a democrat
i guarantee there will be a good number of debate
i look forward to them
mr. lhota make his proposal shortly after another poll show mr. de blasio with a commanding lead underscore the long odds mr. lhota face in a city where democrats far outnumber republican
in the new poll release by quinnipiac university mr. de blasio have the support of 66 percent of likely voter compare with 25 percent for mr. lhota
the independence party candidate adolfo carriã³n jr. receive 2 percent
a poll of likely voter release on tuesday by wnbc the wall street journal and marist college show mr. de blasio with a 43-point lead

ninety percent of black voter support him as do 68 percent of hispanic voter and 52 percent of white voter

the day my daughter arrive home from her first year in college her boyfriend move in
they do not consult me
one day i be happily live alone in my two bedroom seattle apartment and the next i have two teenage roommate one of whom i hardly know
the boyfriend who be still a high school senior have be my daughter 's summer fling before she leave for college last september
with my last child go i think i would be terribly sad and lonely
and i be for about 10 minute
after i have spend a brief stint lie on her bed mourn her childhood i do what my own mother have do i gather the stuff she have leave behind and move it to the basement storage unit
then i take over the office nook she have claim but hardly ever use and make it my own
i instal shelf and fill them with my reference book
i stock the refrigerator and cupboard with gluten free low fat food
i buy soap in scent that please me and shampoo that suit my hair type
i rearrange the furniture and clean the house from top to bottom
with each pas of the vacuum i find myself become cheerier
my husband have move to our farm on lopez island in the san juan islands of washington with our two dog to pursue his dream of be a homesteader change our marriage into a long distance arrangement with occasional weekend visit
i find myself for the first time in 35 year live alone in a perfectly tidy apartment
i love it
then in may the school year end and my daughter come home for the summer
after be away for so long she could barely wait to see her boyfriend
he move into her bedroom the night she arrive and hardly ever leave except to attend his last few class of high school
the two of them be so enamored of each other i do not have the heart to separate them
i assume they would soon grow bore with see each other every day and he would go home
this do not happen
the big problem be that my daughter and her boyfriend bring with them a level of messiness i have grow unaccustomed to
they shed clothing like dog shed fur pepper the apartment with sweatshirt t shirt and underwear
they prefer my shower to hers and soon the drain be clog with hair
while i be out of town on business they move into my bedroom too i have a king size bed and they find it roomy
they produce mound of laundry garbage and recycling
the water and electricity bill both shoot up
my daughter love cooking and decide that her summer job be to teach her boyfriend to cook
unfortunately their enthusiasm do not extend to clean up
i would arrive home from work to dirty dish and half fill pot and pan on the stove
the kitchen floor would be sticky the stovetop spatter with oil and the oven bottom crusty with burn food
when i ask if the boyfriend may help out a little by do dish or take out the compost my daughter say he ' phobic about get his hand dirty
i 'm sure that work well for him i reply
weeks pass as the lovebird languish in my apartment
i would leave for work at 10:30 a.m. and return at 7 p.m. to find them exactly where i have leave them sprawl on the couch watch rerun of monk
the only way i could tell they have even move be that the food i have buy for dinner be go and the kitchen be a mess
the boyfriend 's mother upset that her 18-year old son hardly come home anymore often call him on his cell
a refugee from war tear vietnam she have high hope for her son and i often overhear him argue with her in vietnamese
one day when he and my daughter put in a brief appearance at her house his mother sit my daughter down and try to explain that her son be college bind and nothing especially a girlfriend be go to stand in his way
when i ask my daughter how the conversation have go she reply she ' nuts
over dinner one night at a local restaurant i vent my frustration to my friend howard
why be you allow it
he ask incredulous that i have not put my foot down
liberal mother syndrome
i say
it ' probably a reaction to my own experience

judith gille live in seattle
her memoir the view from casa chepitos a journey beyond the border be to be publish next month by davis bay press
jhumpa lahiri first make her name with quiet meticulously observe story about indian immigrant try to adjust to new life in the united states story that have the hush intimacy of chamber music
the premise of her new novel the lowland in contrast be startlingly operatic
udayan an idealistic student in calcutta in the 1960 be draw into mao inspire revolutionary politics
after his violent death which happen fairly early in the novel his devoted dutiful brother subhash marry his pregnant widow gauri and bring her to america in hope of give her a new start in a new country
their marriage though will remain haunted by their memory of udayan and a terrible secret gauri keep to herself
the lowland be certainly ms. lahiri 's most ambitious undertaking yet and it eventually open out into a move family story
it be initially hobble however by page and page of historical exposition by a schematic plotline and by a disjunction between the author 's scrupulous lapidary prose and the dramatic dickensian event she recount
it be only in the second half that ms. lahiri 's talent for capture the small emotional detail of her character daily life take over immerse us in their story and make us less aware of the book 's creaky and often noisy hydraulics
in her 2003 novel the namesake as in her two collection of short story unaccustomed earth and the pulitzer prize win interpreter of maladies the life of ms. lahiri 's character be make palpably real to us through her exacting evocation of their day to day routine the wonder bread sandwich tint green with curry that a bengali mother make for her embarrassed daughter to take to school the careful adoption of american ritual like make snowman or dye easter egg
such particular accentuate the difference between immigrant parent and their american bear child and the almost existential sense of dislocation that exile can produce in people who feel at home neither in their ancestral country nor in the united states
while the reader come to know these earlier people as distinct individual the character in the lowland seem to have be conceive as representative type with designate role to play in a family melodrama construct to underscore generational pattern of resentment and redemption rootedness and freedom
udayan be the rebellious impulsive brother who make a series of reckless decision that will affect everyone who love him for decade to come
subhash be the nice rational brother who will spend much of his life deal with the fallout from his sibling 's heedless action
gauri be an angry selfish woman who will repay subhash 's generosity and kindness and his effort to invent a new life for them in rhode island with chilly disregard
subhash 's mother have try to dissuade him from marry gauri tell him that she ' udayan 's wife she will never love you
she also warn him that gauri be too withdrawn too aloof to be a mother
though this prophecy have be deliver by a woman embitter by the death of her favorite son it will turn out to be all too true gauri will abandon her daughter bela conceive with udayan and bring up by subhash as his own beloved child to pursue her own dream of study philosophy and build an academic career
ms. lahiri never manage to make this terrible act handle by gauri with cruelty and arbitrary highhandedness plausible understandable or viscerally feel
why would gauri regard motherhood and career as an either/or choice
why make no effort to stay in touch with bela or explain her decision to move to california
why not discuss her need to leave her marriage and her child with her husband
because ms. lahiri never give us real insight into gauri 's decision making or psychology she come across not as a flawed and complicated person but as a folk tale parody of a cold selfish witch who ' fulfil her nasty mother in law 's bad prediction
the reader often have the sense that ms. lahiri be try to fit her character into a predetermined narrative design which can make for diagrammatic and unsatisfying storytelling
what turn this novel around and ultimately seize the reader 's imagination be ms. lahiri 's deeply feel depiction of subhash 's relationship with bela his unwavering devotion to this good hearted little girl his bafflement as her grief over her mother 's abandonment lead her to withdraw from him as well his slow painful effort to rebuild a life for himself in the wake of gauri 's departure
it be in these late chapter that the cumbersome historical exposition and overarching narrative architecture fall away and ms. lahiri 's most shining gift as a writer come to the fore her ability to conjure the daily texture of people 's life her understanding of how their personal and cultural expectation have shape their choice her talent for map mood and inchoate emotion with pointillist precision
as this happen the character in the lowland with the qualified exception of gauri become fully human drive not by one identifiable trait like duty anger or rebellion but by a full spectrum of feeling and capable not only of rage and vexation but also of forgiveness and hope
by its end this ungainly novel remind us of ms. lahiri 's copious talent as a writer however imperfectly they be employ here

i want to strangle the man he leave very very little emma rutherford the curator of warts and all the portrait miniatures of samuel cooper which open on nov. 13 at the philip mould gallery in london say in an interview

san francisco
this be already go to be a banner season at the san francisco opera for the american soprano patricia racette
her performance always thoughtful and touching ms. racette have long be a favorite here and she be schedule to star in no few than three of the year 's eight production
then as tend to happen in the hyperdramatic world of opera calamity strike
late last month the powerful mezzo soprano dolora zajick who have be give the title role in tobias picker 's new opera dolores claiborne an adaptation of the stephen king novel drop out cite bad knee and the part 's vocal and physical challenge
ms. zajick have an understudy the veteran mezzo catherine cook but the company no doubt want a big name for such a prominent premiere
so ms. racette who have create role in two prior picker opera emmeline 1996 and an american tragedy present by the metropolitan opera in 2005 step up and learn the part in time for opening night on wednesday
ms. cook will sing the two final performance schedule for early october
ms. racette 's admirable move be that of an authentic trouper a gutsy act that should not be underestimate particularly since ms. racette be concurrently star in boito 's mefistofele
you want her to succeed
if in the end though she merely acquit herself nicely it be more the fault of mr. picker and his librettist the poet j. d. mcclatchy than it be hers
their drab dolores have a drab dolores at its center
which be surprising since dullness be the one thing you could not accuse mr. king 's 1992 best seller of be
this be the first operatic adaptation that mr. king have approve but not the last the shining by paul moravec and mark campbell be schedule to open at the minnesota opera in 2016
dolores claiborne take the inherently theatrical form of a monologue dolores an age housekeeper on a tiny island off of maine be at a police interrogation deny the charge that she murder her rich capricious employer vera donovan
dolores do however freely confess to kill her husband joe st. george decade earlier
she be irresistibly profane candid and contentious as her story plunge back to her miserable marriage to joe a lazy alcoholic who beat her and sexually abuse their daughter selena
during a solar eclipse she finally lure him drunk and furious into the backyard well ensure selena 's future but also painfully their estrangement
there be clear operatic potential in a woman who turn homicidal when she have her back up against the wall
not for nothing be the san francisco opera call mr. picker 's dolores claiborne an american tosca
but puccini ruthlessly effective in his melody and his dramaturgy make you believe to the depth of your being in the love that propel tosca 's fate forward and the evil that stand in her way
his pacing be swift and inexorable
mr. picker and mr. mcclatchy on the other hand have create an opera that hover rather than hurtles
while we be tell that dolores care for selena they sing a duet after all we never feel it so her sacrifice do not pack any punch
that be not to say that mr. picker 's craftsmanship be ever less than expert
his score cleanly arrange for a traditional orchestra be consistent and coherent in its post romantic brooding rather than fashionably eclectic
conduct by george manahan it simmer clearly enough to make all the exposition audible the scene be separate by interlude full of grand wave of sound
there be lovely detail throughout
early in the first act vera 's admonition to her maid about properly hang the sheet to dry set to angular jitter open up into sumptuous ardor then close again into anxiety with an ease of transition that recall janacek
the collaborator have invent an ingeniously creepy nursery rhyme for joe the resonant fearless bass baritone wayne tigges to sing as he molest selena with a translucent percussive accompaniment
but as with too much contemporary american opera the vocal line strand between speak and sing dissonance and tonal lyricism leave sen ten ce with odd stil ted stress es
and the trapping of traditional grand opera embrace by mr. picker do not serve this particular story
a party scene at vera 's mansion promise to be like the wedding in lucia di lammermoor interrupt by some horrible public revelation but nothing much happen
two soar aria one for dolores and one for selena both seem extraneous mean to relieve tension but serve only to halt momentum
selena 's sing with pure tone by the soprano susannah biller be an ode to the star that ultimate poetic cliche 1 2

we have 25 artist and this be a way of do thing serendipitously he go on
if a young artist have an idea we can respond to it quickly
from the met to texas since he leave the metropolitan museum of art to become director of the museum of fine arts houston last year gary tinterow have woo several of his former colleague to join him in texas

violence against child strike most people as a uniquely terrible phenomenon which may be why filmmaker be so fond of it
nothing spark a revenge plot or allow a director to trade intellectual nuance for visceral feeling quite as efficiently as a child in peril
when deal with people who gratuitously cause the innocent to suffer no retribution seem too extreme and the history of movie be full of good man and a few woman drive to righteous brutality against predator kidnapper and abuser
keller dover the enrage
grief addled father play by hugh jackman in denis villeneuve 's prisoner seem like such a character
he ' not a person keller say of the man he believe be responsible for the abduction of his young daughter and her friend
and this conviction that the apparent perpetrator have forfeit his humanity allow an honorable family man to contemplate torture and murder
he beat his captive bloody and lock him in a makeshift cell in an abandon building hop to extract the truth and perhaps also a measure of rough justice
when the other girl 's parent viola davis and terrence howard express doubt about what keller be do their qualm strike him as evidence of weakness and irrationality
but if prisoners write by aaron guzikowski uphold some of the convention of the angry dad revenge drama it also subvert them in surprising at time devastating way
the easy catharsis of righteous payback be complicate at every turn and pain and uncertainty spread like spill oil on an asphalt road
when the girl anna and joy go miss late on thanksgiving afternoon suspicion focus on the driver of a camper that have be park in their small town pennsylvania neighborhood
an arrest be make of a young man paul dano who seem mentally disabled and share no information about the girl whereabouts
then a dead body be find in an elderly priest 's basement and a second young man with a nervous manner and a haunted look show up at a vigil for the miss child and run away into the night
false lead and shadowy connection proliferate and nobody know if anna and joy be dead or alive
it ' all very creepy and mysterious and prisoners be among other thing a satisfy whodunit with artfully deposit clue and twist that be surprising without entirely undermine the film 's naturalistic credibility
but mr. villeneuve a french canadian director whose previous movie include incendies and polytechnique be more invest in mood and meaning than in plot
a connoisseur of grim tale incendies be about the endless trauma of a middle eastern civil war polytechnique be base on the true story of a shooting rampage at a montreal university
he have an intense almost philosophical interest in the nature of evil
like zodiac mystic river and the silence of the lambs prisoner suggest that evil be not confine to a single person or set of action
crime be specify and criminal be discover but empirical solution be not enough to dispel the feeling that an uncontained atmospheric menace brood over this wintry landscape
roger a. deakins 's somber cinematography turn the keystone state into a study of gray and brown dead leaf and bare tree under a sky like wet metal
keller a survivalist with a basement full of canned good and battery seem to have be infect by it even before the disappearance of his daughter
his wife maria bello tip into a pool of despair
other people like the aunt of one of the suspect melissa leo be weigh down by bad luck and weary dread
but the most tormented character may be detective loki jake gyllenhaal whose connection to the kidnapping be professional rather than personal
like keller loki be a familiar figure in a movie like this and the contrast between them the hotheaded impulsive avenger and the cool careful sleuth be something we have see before
mr. jackman be solid and persuasive but it be mr. gyllenhaal with his downturned mouth and twitchy eye who anchor the film
we know nothing of loki 's off duty life if he even have one but he be the sensitive skeptical filter through which we try to imagine the fate that could have befall two happy child play on a november afternoon
nearly all of prisoners take place within a single week but mr. villeneuve wisely if also somewhat cruelly refuse to speed up or to spike the action with jolt of adrenaline
he capture with impressive discipline just how slowly time can move during a crisis how the static condition of not know can press down on every moment
panic can be paralyze as it be for keller 's wife and joy 's parent but act rashly as keller be incline to can have catastrophic effect
prisoner be the kind of movie that can quiet a room full of casual thrill seeker
it absorb and control your attention with such assurance that you hold your breath for fear of distract the people on screen exhale in relief or amazement at each new revelation
by the end you may be a little wear out and perhaps also slightly let down by the fussily clever revelation that wrap up the story but in the meantime you be a willing captive unable to tell the difference between dread and delight

steve murphy swear he have nothing against his parent
but at age 27 mr. murphy who have his own financial planning business do not feel like he should still be live in his childhood home in massapequa long island
i think i be push the limit to be honest with you he say
but you almost become complacent
you almost think it ' the norm
in a sense it be
accord to a new report from the regional plan association an urban research and policy group 55 percent of all 20- to 34-year old on long island still live with their parent which be up 11 percent in a decade and appear to be one of the high rate in the country
but while some may actively choose to sleep in full view of their teenage poster and trophy most be there because there be few other place they can go
nassau and suffolk counties suffer from an acute shortage of rental apartment accord to the report long island 's rental housing crisis which state that the place that practically invent the postwar tract suburb have fail to keep pace with housing trend since
for year government official housing advocate and real estate executive on long island have warn about the exodus of young people not to mention the difficulty of housing low wage earner
but the regional plan association report draw some tough conclusion
the shortage of affordable rental home be already strain long island 's economy and will make it much hard to compete for job in the year ahead it say
â
what seem hard to dispute be that long island be seriously crunch for apartment compare with other suburb
base on census data 21 percent of long island 's household live in rental compare with 33 percent in western connecticut 34 percent in the hudson valley and 37 percent in northern new jersey number analyst consider a healthier portion
long island 's 4 percent vacancy rate be also at the low end of the scale put pressure on rent which average $ 1,490 a month in county where income have steadily decline accord to the report
blame for the problem can be lay at the foot of many of the island 's nearly 100 village government whose zoning ban have severely restrict multifamily housing say christopher jones the vice president of research for the regional plan association and an author of the report
by contrast in new jersey there ' be a spike in the construction of rental housing since the state 's supreme court rule in the early 1980 that municipality could not use zoning to exclude low income people and by extension often minority from wealthy area
mr. jones stress that tweak the zoning on long island to allow more apartment do not have to mean that the low slung spread out look of the island epitomize by the curve cape line street of levittown would disappear
indeed the rental could be add in compact downtown business district which could in turn benefit from customer in their often struggle store he add
the character do not have to change mr. jones say
you will still have the same single family neighborhood that people think of when they think of long island
there will just be more choice
yet the pro growth slant of mr. jones 's report have irk some critic who note that some of the report 's contributor employee of building trade association and bank for instance stand to gain from development project
long island have be trouble by a tight rental market since the 1940 when its farm begin to get plow under for subdivision say robert w. burchell the chairman of the urban planning department at rutgers university
dr. burchell know that scenario firsthand
from 1947 to 1959 when he be a child his family rent a series of home in nassau county
we have to move anytime the landlord find somebody willing to pay more he say
but long island for the most part have prosper all the same with low crime rate good school and high property value all the hallmark of a desirable area he say 1 2 next page
homeowner with a mortgage insure by the federal housing administration or the department of veterans affairs should consider use their loan term as a marketing tool when it come time to sell
mortgage loan from both government agency include a little know feature know as assumability
in other word the buyer of a home finance with an exist f.h.a. or v.a. loan may be able to take over or assume the seller 's loan under the same term rather than take out a new mortgage
during period when interest rate be rise home offer for sale with an assumable low rate mortgage may have extra appeal for certain buyer
you could now have a seller say i have a great house to sell you and a great mortgage to go with it which be better than my neighbor who only have a great house,'â say marc israel an executive vice president of kensington vanguard national land services and a real estate lawyer
it ' a very clever idea
the saving for buyer assume a loan extend beyond a low interest rate
assume a loan be cheap than apply for a new one because there be few settlement fee
an appraisal be not require though a buyer may want to obtain one anyway
and in new york borrower assume a loan do not have to pay the hefty mortgage recording tax a second time mr. israel say
â f.h.a. loan do demand that the borrower pay for mortgage insurance over the life of the loan
but when assume a loan borrower do not have to pay the upfront mortgage insurance premium require on a new loan accord to john walsh the president of total mortgage services in milford conn.
and he note because the original mortgage holder would have be pay the loan for a number of year the buyer assume the loan will start at a point deeper into the amortization schedule than on a new loan
that mean more of the monthly payment will go toward principal
in a rise rate environment assumability be a very attractive option say katie miller the vice president of mortgage product for navy federal credit union
it end up make home that much more affordable
she emphasize however that loan assumption be often not a viable option for first time buyer if the seller have accumulate substantial equity in the home
say for example that the seller 's loan balance be $ 150,000 and the sale price for the property be $ 200,000
the borrower assume the loan must come up with the $ 50,000 difference either in cash or through some type of subordinate financing
that can be too big a hurdle for first time buyer
the more attractive option at navy federal be the homebuyers choice loan which offer 100 percent financing
these loan currently account for about a quarter of the credit union 's purchase volume and 65 percent of those borrower be first time buyer ms. miller say
borrower seek to assume a loan must also prove their creditworthiness as they would for any f.h.a. or v.a. loan
under f.h.a. rule once a new borrower be find to be creditworthy enough to assume a loan the lender must release the seller from any future liability for payment of that loan
borrower consider loan assumption should weigh the cost against other loan option pay attention to the principal and interest payment the amount of cash require upfront and the private mortgage insurance premium
at the end of the day mr. walsh say if the prospective buyer can come up with the down payment and qualify for the loan assumption then it could be a huge benefit
the new york times company announce on thursday that it would pay a quarterly dividend to its shareholder for the first time in five year
the company 's board vote to approve a dividend of 4 cent a share to all shareholder of record as of oct. 9 2013
it will be pay on oct. 24 the week before the times announce its third quarter earnings
the times have not pay a dividend since dec. 14 2008
the dividend which apply to both class a and class b share will cost the company roughly $ 24 million a year
in a statement mark thompson president and chief executive of the times say that the board have conclude that the strength of the balance sheet justify the restoration of a dividend
but mr. thompson warn that the company would remain cautious in its financial strategy
give the expectation of continued volatility in advertising revenue and the fact that our growth strategy be at an early stage of development we will maintain a prudent view of both the balance sheet and free cash flow he say
during recent earnings call analyst have repeatedly ask times executive to issue a dividend
in the first quarter of 2013 analyst note that there be a sell off of the company 's stock after management announce it would not issue a dividend because of concern about the financial state of the medium industry
but in august the times report that it have swing to a profit from strong circulation revenue and lower operating cost
john janedis an analyst with ubs say that it make sense for the times to issue a dividend now because the company be sell its final noncore asset the new england media group which include the boston globe
after that sale close next month the times will be able to focus exclusively on build its core brand the new york times
you basically have a clean balance sheet you have free cash flow at the company mr. janedis say
he add that a dividend also make sense give how much the company have slimmed down in term of asset
mr. janedis estimate that the times could afford to pay shareholder the dividend despite the medium industry 's financial challenge
even if the ad market weaken further and there be virtually zero return on their growth initiative they can easily fund the dividend if not increase it mr. janedis say
in its last earnings report the times report that as of june 30 it have cash and security total about $ 918 million
london ed miliband the leader of the opposition labour party appear to have prime minister david cameron on the rope
mr. cameron have just lose a vote in parliament on a nonbinding motion to consider military action in syria over chemical weapon the first time in at least a century that a prime minister have not get parliamentary support for such a response
mr. cameron throw in the towel
but mr. miliband whose own position on the issue keep shift do not seize the moment neither that night aug. 29 nor in the next day
he neither speak convincingly to the nation about the nature of its alliance its foreign policy or its value nor do he attack mr. cameron effectively for mismanage the entire issue
in a sense both major party leader show themselves unable to master their own restive party
after three year as head of labour mr. miliband just 43 have not manage to convince the british public that he be prime ministerial material
question about his leadership will hang over his party 's annual conference which begin sunday
in the word of a columnist for the newspaper the guardian michael white mr. miliband while have good instinct flicker rather than shin
john curtice professor of politics at strathclyde university in glasgow say more bluntly that polling show that mr. miliband be clearly not a help to his party and he may well be a hindrance
the coalition government of the conservative mr. cameron and the liberal democrat nick clegg be unpopular mr. curtice say but there be deep doubt among voter about whether mr. miliband believe in anything very strongly
people be unclear what he stand for mr. curtice say
it ' not just that he ' see as geeky or intellectual he have not manage to show people that he have a vision and a sense of direction
there ' a lack of definition
mr. miliband who become the labour party 's leader three year ago after a devastating election defeat that end 13 year of labour government always have a huge task ahead of him even with new election not expect until may 2015
he become leader a few month after his party be reject comprehensively say peter kellner a political analyst who run a polling firm yougov
he be a cabinet minister and close to gordon brown so he be implicate in the wide reputation of a government that fail
any new labour leader would have trouble combat that
mr. miliband mr. kellner say have plainly not manage to break through as a person there be mountain of data on our web site on how he be not regard as strong or tough or up to the job as prime minister
in any case mr. kellner note britons historically give new government a second chance
it have be decade since a party new to opposition win a majority government after a single term
mr. miliband have real strength beyond intelligence and decency
he do not support britain 's involvement in the iraq war which so badly damaged tony blair and he boldly oppose rupert murdoch 's powerful medium empire in the wake of the phone hack scandal
in my view ed 's leadership have be characterize by courage resilience and a determination to stand up for family who have bear the brunt of economic tough time say stewart wood a close adviser to mr. miliband

he stand up to rupert murdoch he stand up to david cameron on syria and he have not be afraid to say that labour have to turn the page from the blair/brown year
mr. wood say that labour 's emphasis on how to reverse the decline in living standard that face most people in our country will help the party regain popularity
with the economy finally improve and the election more than 18 month away labour will argue that a mod recovery will benefit only a small slice of british society that need no help
part of mr. miliband 's problem stem from his past as a bright young aide and then minister in labour government and part come from the residue of his extraordinary decision to run for the leadership against his old brother david miliband who be a more senior figure have be foreign secretary
it be an openly freudian struggle which the young miliband win narrowly with the help of trade union vote david miliband have come out ahead among labour lawmaker and party member
mr. miliband have struggle to lose both the taint of fratricide and the stain of be beholden to trade union boss who be not the most popular figure in britain
to avoid further speculation david miliband finally quit his own seat in parliament and leave the country recently begin a new job in new york as the head of the international rescue committee a nongovernmental organization aid refugee
mr. cameron highlight the influence of union leader whenever possible
so recent claim that a union have rig the selection of labour 's candidate to fight a parliamentary seat in falkirk scotland prove highly embarrassing
mr. miliband set up an inquiry which find no rule be break
but more boldly in an effort to show decisiveness he also announce plan to end the automatic affiliation to labour of about three million union member unless they specifically ask otherwise
while union member will still be invite to join the party labour face an inevitable and significant drop in financing
still recent statement suggest that union may retain significant influence over some labour decision make prompt claim that mr. miliband be backtrack and will accept a half measure
his allies argue that an overhaul will be more successful step by step
but he may gain little credit anyway mr. curtice say give the perception that he be force into change by the falkirk controversy
be mr. miliband a tory leader with similar rating mr. kellner say he would be subject to a possible putsch
but labour have little tradition of dump its leader
mr. cameron and mr. clegg be not themselves especially popular
mr. clegg be consider to have sacrifice crucial element of his electoral agenda to get his party into the govern coalition and be clearly the junior player to mr. cameron
mr. cameron have oversee tough year of economic austerity and recession and he be be outflank on the right by an anti european party know as the united kingdom independence party or ukip. mr. curtice think that labour should be significantly farther ahead in the poll than now its lead over the tories have shrink considerably since early summer
still he say give an electoral system that favor labour because of the distribution of its voter the unpopularity of the liberal democrats and slippage of conservative vote to ukip the labour party may win by default
do not go look for fancy italian at osteria cucina rustica in marlboro
despite the impose facade of this restaurant in a former bank the fare be indeed rustic as the name suggest
flavor be simple
quality be high and most everything be make in house
much of what i sample on two visit be well prepared a main dish of risotto with delicate and juicy grill shrimp each grain separate and slightly al dente exquisite branzino fillet perfectly pan sear and season with butter shallot white wine lemon and a sprinkle of caper lay over a bed of beluga lentil hearty hanger steak that be tender and delicious enough to continue eat past satiety
service be old school indulgent
we be lead to our table by young woman all the waiter be attentive man in lab style white coat who pay attention to water and wine and apologize when the main course take too long to arrive
price for such service food quality and attention to detail be not cheap but they be fair
others seem to agree since there be a robust size crowd there both night on my first visit a weekend several diner accompany by woman and child display full sleeve tattoo on a weeknight though there be a few woman and couple it seem more like a businessman 's club
the ambience be mix
wide plank floor salvage from old barn around the country with expose beam above say down home the high ceiling and the sleek white tile see in the partly open kitchen behind glass suggest sophistication
the space be also inordinately loud and the air conditioning be so cold on both visit that i contemplate use the elegantly large napkin as a shawl
the owner angelo bongiovanni who act as host and steven botta the chef open the restaurant in mid july they be also partner in brando 's an italian restaurant in asbury park mr. bongiovanni say in a phone interview
it be clear that they care about the food
a trio of amusement roast garlic in olive oil herbed ricotta and pickle zucchini arrive alongside a basket of warm bread and be tasty with the addition of a bit of salt
among the appetizer the fritto misto which be mostly calamari with a cameo of shrimp and scallop be nicely do the fried batter enhance rather than distract from the seafood the inclusion of caper berry their stem on tuck into the seafood be a witty touch
burrata a special with prosciutto one night be diminish only slightly by its cool temperature the polenta with shave black truffle be agreeably hot but too much pecorino romano mask the flavor of corn
of the three salad the caesar with its romaine heart and ciabatta crouton be best ingredient in the toscana chop green red onion tomato cucumber slice almond and dry cherry stubbornly resist melding and the finocchio a combination of fennel with parmigiano reggiano toast pine nut and slice orange lack flavor
a special appetizer of fig stuff with maytag blue cheese and roasted garlic then wrap in prosciutto and set atop small oval of cool watermelon be a terrific idea but with every bite i wish that the prosciutto have not be broil to brown but leave pink and luscious
among the pasta the bolognese sauce be well flavored and balanced but the pasta serve with it pacheri imagine very fat unwieldy rigatoni leave us wonder how to eat it since we certainly could not twirl it around a fork
farfalle with swiss chard gaeta olive and toast breadcrumb be flavorless hard to fathom with such assertive ingredient
as for the secondo that stellar branzino risotto with shrimp and barolo glaze hanger steak face competition from the pollo scarpariello
the pan sauteed chicken piece with sausage and lemon be serve with just enough potato piece to mash into the juice
vegetable be uninspired except for the mashed potato and intensely flavorful cherry tomato serve with the hanger steak
sauteed broccoli rabe be exceedingly mild to the point of boredom
and i have hop the swiss chard with fava bean puree would be a riff on the italian bean and green stew but no
it be a portion of green with a scoop of greenish gray matter on top
yes that be the bean and they taste o.k. but the dish need a do over
of the typical italian dessert we like the zabaglione and the affogato vanilla ice cream top with espresso of the atypical the warm chocolate cake with a small scoop of ice cream be memorable enough to put on my list for the next time i be in the neighborhood after a caesar salad and that branzino over lentil

behind close door art in the spanish american home 1492 1898 at the brooklyn museum leave us in the strange position of marvel at the opulence of domestic life in the spanish colony while ponder some of the ugly aspect of colonialism
this be awkward to be sure but also enlightening
as its voyeuristic title suggest the show follow the layout of a typical house belong to an elite member of new world society
draw largely from the museum 's sizable collection of spanish colonial art it fashion a gorgeous set of temporary period room out of the fourth floor special exhibition gallery
they overflow with sumptuous textile family portrait bear coat of arm fine silver and porcelain and gild everything arrange in the more be more manner of the spanish american upper crust with cabinet stack in pyramid and luxury good lay out on carpet platform
all this conspicuous consumption be as strategic as it be materialistic
it be a way for newly wealthy creoles in this context spaniards bear in the americas and people of indigenous ancestry bar from important church and government position because they be not bear in spain to thumb their nose at the spanish crown
dignitary from spain who visit one of these home would see potent reminder of the new world 's natural resource
they would also at time see spanish americans assert their own noble lineage in genealogy or portrait of inca royalty paint in a european style
one such painting of 14 inca king hang at the exhibition 's entrance next to goya 's 1806 painting of don tadeo bravo de rivero a peruvian who edge his way into spain 's chivalric order through military service
one of the few creole able to do so he flaunt the cross and jeweled badge of the spanish order of santiago
as these example suggest obsession with race bloodline and birthplace some particular to the spanish colony others more widespread haunt
behind closed doors
visitor be constantly confront with family tree and other more or less hereditary claim to power
title could be purchase but the buyer first have to prove noble ancestry and a purity of blood a phrase that effectively mean people of jewish or moorish descent need not apply
also on view be casta painting that employ a rigid racial classification system one be call from spanish and indian mestizo and show a spanish man and his indigenous wife with their mestizo or mixed race baby
here too be work that be not quite casta painting but seem closely related such as the group portrait free woman of color with their child and servant in a landscape by agostino brunias an italian work in the british colony
the painting be not as progressive as it sound it reinforce colonial hierarchy of race and class by surround its fashionable young heroine one of the free woman of the title with dark skin attendant who may well be her slave
in some of the decorative artwork at least culture mix and mingle freely and without the need for taxonomy
a highlight be a large folding screen that once grace the viceregal palace in mexico city
one side show battle scene base on dutch print from the great turkish war the other depict a hunt party model on those in gobelins tapestry
both have be render by mexican artist in a traditional shell inlay technique know as enconchado on an object the six panel screen long associate with asia
and in various place throughout the show the museum 's european art curator richard aste juxtapose spanish colonial art and furniture with similar object from the british colony
in do so as he note in the catalog he be continue a dialogue from a 1999 installation in the museum 's american paintings gallery
viewer of behind close door may also want to visit interwoven globe the worldwide textile trade 1500 1800 which have a similar cross colonial frisson at the metropolitan museum of art
it ' a lively one especially when portrait go head to head miguel cabrera 's stern 1760 painting of a wealthy creole doã±a marã­a de la luz padilla y gã³mez de cervantes for instance versus john singleton copley 's steely 1772 depiction of abigail pickman gardiner marry to the wealthy boston landowner sylvester gardiner
see them together let you compare and contrast the fashion and beauty trend particular to their respective colony doã±a marã­a 's face be dot with chiqueadores or glue on beauty mark while mrs. gardiner wear a billowy costume ã la turque of a salmon color robe over green harem pant

behind close door offer an intimate look at the life of colonial woman
we come to know some of them like doã±a marã­a through their formal portrait others like the wealthy indigenous landowner marã­a angela cachicatari through private painting and object in their possession
a large and fascinating section of the show recreate the estrado a parlorlike area of the home where woman pass much of the day socializing drink yerba mate and do needlework while sit cross legged on floor cushion
these glimpse of the good life and enough decorative installation to fill many an interior designer 's inspiration board be what we expect from a show on the home of the wealthy
but in this exhibition the severity of colonial subjugation be just as visible and in the end more affect

consider that cervantes present his don quixote as the translation of a chronicle of true event write by one cide hamete benengeli this do not strike me as particularly perplexing unless she ' wait for enlightenment about why j. m. coetzee decide to make cervantes 's narrative device the truth in the world of this book

we celebrate the power of memory not just on rosh hashana the day of remembrance but on all the holiday when we recall the exodus from egypt as well as the entrance of our ancestor into the promised land the various harvest of the crop and even the creation of the world on the sabbath
moreover four time a year we recall loved one go but not forget at the yizkor memorial service

dara horn 's clever meditation on jewish memory while a delight to read leave the impression that jews be distinct in their piety to history
this be nonsense
religious holiday mark allege historical event from easter to ramadan as much as jews stand again at sinai
such commemoration cut both way
serbian nationalist evoke century old battle against the turks to justify hostilities against muslims and protestants march in northern ireland to commemorate victory over catholics
a variety of religious community be urge not to forget in order to justify present political decision
jews today fret about the pogrom of passover past but orthodox west bank settler also reimagine palestinians as enemy from the biblical amalek to nazis
preserve memory often through misremembering can be as dangerous as it can be pious

dara horn call the suggestion that the anxiety that attend passover may be trace to the terror jewish ancestor feel while prepare the seder in a time of murderous pogrom a mystical and irrational belief in a type of memory no neurologist would recognize
but psychoanalyst be very well acquainted with the intergenerational transmission of trauma
the child and we be now discover the grandchild and great grandchild of holocaust survivor be seriously wounded people
they can certainly heal but scar always remain
i would not consider it mystical or irrational to hypothesize that century of serious easter link trauma could still be send out ripple not that many century later

the acting be wooden the set amateurish the writing banal the pace erratic
moreover ms. parnes use a digital program that turn photographic reality into a hallucinogenic cartoon as richard linklater do in his brilliant film wake life and a scanner darkly
but in ms. parnes 's case the trippy effect come off as crude and garish
the whole thing look like it be make by an enterprising but not exceptionally talented high school student
know it to be actually a sophisticated spoof make no difference
i wonder how i be go to get through an hour of it
after a while however it begin to seem interestingly bad
then it become mysteriously fascinate
i could not stop watch
the plot of what ms. parnes 's web site describe as a web base episodic digital film be complicated

more recently interest in him have be increase abroad and alexander and bonin who represent a somewhat similar artist paul thek continue to be mr. buthe 's new york champion with a third solo show
mr. buthe like mr. thek be gay roman catholic and seek source for art outside his own culture
he be well enough establish in his 20 to be include in the legendary 1969 exhibition when attitude become forms
a year later he first visit morocco and in 1972 spend nearly five month there in the beguiling seaside city of essaouria
its high color building and cornucopian souk cast a spell that saturate his art which move from quasi minimalism to orientalist hippie environment to small exuberant picture that bring sigmar polke a fellow art school student as well as paul klee to mind
there ' a nice suite of such work upstairs at alexander and bonin though the main show consist primarily of three large piece
the 1985 landscape spanish energy a dense assemblage incorporate a pitchfork brocade and the image of a star eye find mr. buthe in a theatrical mode while a pair of 15-foot long abstract triptych painting recall his minimalist root
the two triptych share a title the last secret of fatima a reference to a reported appearance in portugal in 1917 of the virgin mary to three child to whom she entrust three secret
two be make public in the 1940 and the third after heated speculation in 2000
both picture be compose of two monochromatic panel blue in one painting red in the other cover with all over pattern of tiny star and join by a third vertical panel in silver and gold
the result suggest blank icon yayoi kusama dot painting with hinge and stereoscopic view of intergalactic space
they 're lovely

although heavy handed in its symbolism joanna malinowska 's late solo be a high spirited exploration of the north american frontier and its us and abuse by modernist artist
mix sculpture video and performance it make clever theatrical use of a space that ' cavernous by lower east side standard
the main component be a six ton pile of dirt truck in from the yukon territory which nod obliquely to work by robert smithson and walter de maria but be mainly a set for a performance
visit the gallery at the right time and you may see ms. malinowska pan for gold
nearby be another set this one derive from isamu noguchi 's austere design for the martha graham/aaron copland ballet appalachian spring
title bootleg noguchi ms. malinowska 's version substitute a crooked tree branch for the original production 's rectilinear wood frame
on video a russian composer read aloud from allen ginsberg 's poem america his strong accent and deadpan manner work against the ranting verse
this piece be not subtle and neither be the giant papier mã¢che bear model on roadside monument in the yukon that tower over the gallery but both have a role to play in the polish bear ms. malinowska 's affectionate skewering of cold war era pioneer myth
maccarone 630 greenwich street at morton street west village through oct. 19 the protean carol bove continue to cultivate her extraordinary garden operate in the gap between art and design modernism especially minimalism and nature language and structure find and make order and chaos her work/art and other people 's work/art
one of the best artist of our peculiar moment ms. bove start with appropriation sculpture consist of shelf display wear carefully choose paperback on often arcane metaphysical subject
here this opposition be manifest in a large sheet of glass suspend between i beam and flank by two column of the gallery it serve as an immense frame for a small gordian knot of a painting design for the qor corporation by the polymath artist and kabbalist harry smith
it be also implicit in the inclusion of a vitrine of eccentric geometric drawing by and from the archive of lionel ziprin and joanne ziprin who form the mystically incline geometry obsess qor corporation also a tile business with mr. smith
the grid be a living grow thing in ms. bove 's universe
it be present here as fragmentary and possibly mutate in a low lie structure of small perpendicular i beam
it be definitely elegantly mutate in peel 's foe not a set animal laminate a tone of sleep two concrete block that form a seven foot monolith the upper one eat away by a metastasizing grid of shiny brass
her white tubular glyph sculpture while all curve imply infinite extension in their own way while breathe new gently irreverent life into generic public art abstraction
the molecular metabolic nature of the grid be signal by the inclusion of a sculptural and mathematical feat from 1976 by richard berger the top surface of his couch iterate in small lead pellet suspend from micro filament
it also seem implicit in the monumental piece of petrified tree trunk that ms. bove have attach with only six bolt to a tall i beam where it resemble a torso a broken column and its former self
as if this be not enough ms. bove and philip smith a rare book dealer have organize a dense exhibition about the qor corporation in maccarone 's project space at 98 morton street
it contain more drawing by mr. smith and the ziprins and much more study and prototype for tile in which geometry truly lose its mind and gain the universe
meanwhile the title of ms. bove 's show say a lot ra or why be an orange like a bell
it flag her work as relational aesthetic at its most profound and inclusive and flippantly posit the unity of natural and artificial form with a riddle from batman 's foe the riddler
answer they both have to be peel or peal
this show be endless
kansas 59 franklin street between broadway and lafayette street lower manhattan through oct. 19
the victorian pastime of flower press look decidedly contemporary in virginia poundstone 's late solo which make it difficult to separate nature and artifice art and craft and maybe even the quick and the dead
here crush botanical also link several medium digital photography monochrome painting and glass and bronze sculpture
in a series of wall base work for instance ms. poundstone have print image of floral bouquet on perforated vinyl and then sandwich the fabric between glass leave many fold and crease that do not conform to our expectation of the botanical still life
even more confounding be the sculpture small nubby look bronze with pour glass accent
identify as fossil they be cast from plaster impression of flower petal and rest on stack cardboard press in lieu of traditional pedestal
the different material volume and sculptural technique make you think about the structural complexity of a live blossom and the difficulty of preserve it
the painting gold rush and high roller which cover small wooden panel with uniform arrangement of silky yellow petal be the most conventional work here
their title however be suggestive they bring to mind the 17th century dutch phenomenon of tulipmania as well as more current form of economic speculation
and they round out this sometimes cerebral show with a burst of color and texture that ' intensely gratifying however long it last
thomas erben gallery 526 west 26th street fourth floor chelsea through oct. 26 bear in tehran in 1982 barbad golshiri be part of a generation of young iranian artist who work primarily at home be distance themselves from the easy exoticism that sell well abroad
at the same time they 're try to make art that ' critically responsive to contemporary iran and to a political culture that oppose on ideological ground much of what they 're do
mr. golshiri 's tough wiry second new york solo be make up of sculptural grave marker most of them in the horizontal format of muslim tombstone
at least one piece directly subvert the traditional model
call pentimento it ' a flat rectangle of black iron pierce with a cluster of stakelike upright and carry a heretical inscription the customary arabic invocation there be no god but allah reduce to two word no god
other piece be dedicate to political martyr
one tombstone incise with a labyrinth pattern commemorate ahmad mir alaei a translator of jorge luis borges into persian who be kill in 1995 in the so call chain murder of iran reputedly carry out by government agent that wipe out dozen of dissident writer and intellectual many of them friend of the artist 's father the novelist houshang golshiri 1938 2000
another memorial design for a dissident who have be officially deny a tombstone consist of a stencil cut of a funerary inscription that can be temporarily but repeatedly apply to the site of the grave
the show a collaboration with aaran art gallery in tehran include tribute to western artist and writer jan van eck samuel beckett
mr. golshiri hold dear as well as a marker for himself which look like a work in progress
surely its existence be premature but in the context of work about the politics of death the message be be ready you never know
few wine notion be toss around as frequently and as randomly as balance
often it ' state axiomatically as in good wine must be balance
who can argue with that
sometimes it ' use as a rationalization as when speak of ultrahigh alcohol wine alcohol be just a number
it do not matter as long as the wine be balance
i take issue with that statement
alcohol manifest itself in many way beyond a feeling of heat on the palate
it affect the texture the body and naturally the physical effect of a wine
balance be just a small part of that overall equation
i have be think about balance since the wine panel not long ago taste 20 bottle of red bierzo from castilla y leã³n in northwestern spain just east of galicia
bierzo be one region that have help usher in the exciting modern era of spanish wine
the primary red grape mencã­a can make wine range from light and pretty to dense and structured yet always with beguiling exotic aroma of wild red fruit
the style depend on the intent of the winemaker of course but also importantly on where the grape be grow
those on terraced slate hillside for example tend to be more concentrated and complex than those from clay base soil on the flatlands
we have taste bierzos several time over the last eight year
in the past we have be thrill by the unusual quality of these wine and by our own sense of discovery
we have observe bierzo an ancient wine region yet new to the world of international wine commerce as it navigate the intricacy of global business waver between a desire to appeal to establish popular taste and a devotion to what make the wine distinctive in the first place
in our late tasting we saw a region that have move past the thrill of the new though eight year may feel like an eternity to modern attention span it be nothing in agricultural year
it be still grapple with issue of stylistic identity as well as with current economic reality
bierzo estate have come and go in the american marketplace where consumer have perhaps gravitate more to the more delicate wine of ribeira sacra also make primarily of mencã­a across the border in galicia
while these big issue remain we be more concerned with the basic winemaking issue of balance
we certainly encounter wine that we like very much but we be also strike by the number of wine that do not seem to conform to that axiomatic definition of a good wine
for the tasting florence fabricant and i be join by gil avital the wine director at tertulia in greenwich village and jill roberts wine director of the marrow in the west village
how do you perceive balance
partly you can sense it when each individual element in a wine fruit tannin alcohol and acidity be in proportion so that no one element dominate or be noticeable by its absence
but balance have a figurative element as well
a truly balance wine will have tension and energy as with german riesling that walk a tightrope between cloy sweetness and mouth parch acidity thrill as they teeter back and forth or great champagne that crackle with a vivacity that demand another sip
the flavor of a wine must also be in balance as with the push pull between bitter and sweet so typical of many italian red
this in particular be where we find too many of the bierzo wine in our tasting fall short
we love the aromatic fruitiness of these wine but quite a few show an off put bitter quality that be out of proportion to the other element
what may have cause such a disjointedness
i can only speculate but i would guess that either the grape be not properly ripe at harvest or the wine be overwork in the cellar as producer try to manipulate or eke out of the wine more intensity than it have to offer
it really depend on where mencã­a grow gil say
it ' get to have balance but it ' hard to handle properly like pinot noir
though we be perhaps more aware of the miss our tasting have its hit as well like our no 1 wine the 2010 vico from raãºl perez
mr. perez be one of the superstar winemaker in northwestern spain and his wine always show great purity and definition
this wine be burly than his more graceful ribeira sacra wine an excellent example of mencã­a make in a slightly warm climate with fruit flavor buttress by mineral and oak accent
yes it be beautifully balance and it will reward a few more year of aging
at $ 35 this be one of mr. perez 's more modestly price wine
other cuvees can soar past $ 90 or $ 100 1 2 next page
dakar senegal oil be be steal on an industrial scale in nigeria the world 's 13th large producer and the country 's politician and security official be among those profit accord to a new report from a prominent british research group
thief steal an estimate average of 100,000 barrel a day the report say work in elaborate network and protect by corrupt security official they tap into the huge and isolated network of pipe that crisscross the country 's swampy southern niger delta region
the price of oil fluctuate but a hypothetical per barrel price of $ 100 would mean an annual loss of $ 3.65 billion
oil close at $ 107.28 per barrel on thursday
much of this oil wind up be export globally say the report which be release thursday by the london base organization chatham house
the problem have reach such proportion that major oil company operate in nigeria have recently complain that theft be cut significantly into production
a similar report last year commission by the nigerian government but largely ignore say that over the preceding decade thief have be steal 6 percent to 30 percent of the country 's daily production
hydrocarbon theft be a major source of loss of revenue to the federal republic of nigeria say that report prepare by the country 's former top anticorruption official nuhu ribadu
it describe the problem then as an emergency
the full extent of the country 's larcenous ingenuity be on display in the oil thievery
there be theft from tank farm refinery storage tank jetty and port accord to the nigerian report
official and private actor disguise theft through manipulation of meter and shipping document
small scale pipeline tap operation can easily be detect in short daytime trip into the swamp from the niger delta 's population center
telltale plume of smoke from illegal refining operation rise above the water
but more significant bunkering as oil theft be know here involve siphon oil from pipe on land or underwater load it onto small barge then transfer it to big barge offshore in the gulf of guinea
sometimes thief use pipe up to 12 inch in diameter to tap the line accord to chatham house
sometimes crude be steal from export terminal
the chatham house report underscore profiteer at high level
top nigerian official cut their teeth in the oil theft business during military rule it say

over time evidence surface that corrupt member of the security force be actively involve
the country 's return to democracy in 1999 then give some civilian official and political godfather more access to steal oil
security official be say to extort payment from the oil thief in return for protection accord to chatham house
the chatham house report suggest that high oil price have contribute to the incentive to steal
but it be inconclusive on the question of how much of the steal crude be export and how much be process in operation in the nigerian swamp
the bush refining business be highly decentralized and secretive it say which make its size hard to estimate

mr. ribadu 's report give a high possible figure for the scale of daily theft 250,000 barrel but the chatham house document emphasize the unreliability of figure from government and oil company
mr. ribadu suggest in strong term than the more recent document that the problem be grow note that shell claim a fivefold increase in loss between 2009 and 2012 from 10,000 barrel per day to 50,000 in march of last year
chatham house by contrast say that outsider should look closely at claim that nigeria be lose oil at unheard of rate add that the high divergence in industrywide estimate make it hard to gauge trend reliably
no american president be more improbable than thomas woodrow wilson
none better embody how we like to think of ourselves in the great world
a princeton university president and political economy professor give to make high minded speech and advocate a parliamentary system wilson hold no public office until he be 54 year old
recruit to run for governor of new jersey in 1910 by a democratic machine bos who think he would be easily control the prof school the pro in practical politics pass a reform agenda that curb the power of party and corporation alike
after deal with college politician he gibe i find that the man with whom i be deal with now seem like amateur
adroitly rid the progressive wave break over the country wilson take the presidency two year later only the second democrat to capture the white house since the civil war
he possess a rare instinct for power and how to use it
once in washington he put his theory to the test audaciously choose to rule more as a prime minister than a traditional chief executive
within 10 month he have pass a progressive agenda that have be stall for a generation slash tariff rate that protect monopoly pass the first permanent federal income tax and create the federal reserve system to end the bank panic that continually ravage the american economy
more reform to bolster antitrust law discourage child labor and inaugurate the eight hour day and worker compensation follow
handsome and charismatic wilson be our first modern president hold regular news conference complain about have to live in washington and delight in popular distraction like baseball game detective story golf and especially the new move picture
he adore woman and have remarkably modern partnership with them share every aspect of his work and his idea with his wife ellen and after she die with his second wife edith
he also have a longtime and apparently platonic female friend
a. scott berg tell the story of wilson the man very well indeed
the author of four previous prizewinning best sell biography he have a novelist 's eye for the striking detail and a vivid prose style
he be on less sure footing when it come to wilson the statesman
too often he rely on shoddy source that distort the historical record
the black death recur frequently but it do not last for 400 year
henry cabot lodge be not a right-â­winger the royal navy do not take a timorous approach to german u boat and winston churchill do not believe that america should have mind its own business and stay out of the world war
berg give us little on the vital economic debate of the progressive era and only a perfunctory comparison of wilson 's new freedom and teddy roosevelt 's new nationalism
there be barely a mention of the pujo committee 's investigation into our financial system which make many of wilson 's reform possible and no attempt to assess the long term effect of these reform
he do better on issue like woman 's right and especially race
wilson a virginia native steep in the lore of the lost cause stuff his cabinet full of bigoted southern mediocrity who cruelly segregate federal office cafeteria and washroom for the first time
when a black journalist and wilson supporter william monroe trotter protest too persistently the president order him out of his office
both his temper and his injudicious selection of adviser be indicative of flaw that would come to devour his presidency
wilson attract some of the most talented figure in american political history to his administration and his cause franklin roosevelt louis brandeis herbert hoover walter lippmann and bernard baruch among others but
too often he fail to delegate well routinely write his own speech and even type his own policy paper
absolute loyalty be value over candor

for the player who have reject two propose contract one that would have cut their salary by a third another by a quarter the lobby itself cost some $ 30 million have become a symbol
though money be raise specifically for the renovation project the player cast the lobby expenditure as a misappropriation of fund that may better be direct toward their remuneration and welfare
the lockout which begin last oct. 1 and wipe out an entire season of concert now jeopardize the start of another which be to include four concert of sibelius at carnegie hall conduct by osmo vanska the orchestra 's music director
it also jeopardize mr. vanska 's tenure since he have threaten to resign if the first two carnegie concert in early november be cancel

the administration say that for that to happen the player would have to have agree to a new contract by last sunday

the orchestra 's season the carnegie concert and mr. vanska 's tenure continue to hang in the balance
be this a time for a gala celebration fund raiser or not the ball raise $ 1 million say michael henson the orchestra 's president and chief executive
if we cancel it we would be $ 1 million bad off
the player be plan a fall season of their own begin with concert on oct. 4 and 5 feature the pianist emanuel ax accord to their web site
what be more say their spokesman blois olson there have be soft interest from unspecified quarter in the notion of have the player stage their own sibelius concert with mr. vanska at carnegie free of management involvement as unlikely as that may seem
magdeburg germany when chancellor angela merkel make an hourlong campaign stop in this town in the former east germany this week ilse siegert be determined not to miss her chance
a descendant of an impoverished noble family who land here in the chaos of 1945 ms. siegert 74 have see her share of german history
for more than a decade she have campaign for better benefit for retiree and others she think be not get their fair share from the german state
so she say she buttonhole ms. merkel as she work the crowd of about 1,500 on tuesday and demand to know what the chancellor plan to do about the issue

before the election they all want to know us ms. siegert say
after the election no one know us at all
she say she may vote for ms. merkel on sunday when the chancellor hop to win a third term but be still consider shun the election altogether
ms. merkel 59 a train physicist spend her first 35 year in the communist east so she may be consider one of us in these part of germany by the political and other elite who like to talk at least publicly of the blossom new state
but she may also have an uphill battle to win over eastern germans who feel shortchanged by capitalism nearly a quarter century after the fall of the berlin wall
part of the former east particularly southern region around leipzig and dresden have flourish
but in place like magdeburg a 1,000-year old town with germany 's old gothic cathedral a renowned university and some very soviet look building that replace bomb ruin leave by the allies the present and future look less gleaming
in more than a dozen conversation a visitor have with old resident at ms. merkel 's campaign stop at old market square talk turn quickly to their too meager pension and among young spectator to their abide indifference toward the chancellor
wage in the former east still tend to be low than in the former west and while pension have even out many easterner rear on illusory view of western bounty still feel cheated
those who have live in the west before the wall fall rarely grouse much anymore about how much reunification cost estimate run around $ 2.7 trillion although some note occasionally that while the living condition of east german may have be miserable most go along with communist rule for four decade
eastern germany have far few people and vote to offer than the west but with poll show the race tighten in its final day ms. merkel find time to make her case here with her usual stump speech modify in an effort to appeal
we have no vote to give away she emphasize possibly the same thought that lead her to visit magdeburg and surround town after catastrophic flood this summer
political loyalty in the former east germany with a population of roughly 15.5 million be split in the last federal election in 2009 between ms. merkel 's christian democrats who win slightly less than 30 percent of the vote and the far leave die linke which get just under 29 percent
the center leave social democrats the no 2 party nationally come in a distant third with 18 percent
peer steinbrã¼ck the social democrat who be ms. merkel 's main challenger cause a stir in august when he accuse her of lack an emotional affinity for europe something he attribute to her east german background
mr. steinbrã¼ck swiftly deny any intent to impugn all east germans whom he call hardworking enterprising people
but the backtracking fail to convince some include werner schulz a european parliament member who be in germany 's parliament for 15 year and a human right activist in east germany
someone who speak like mr. steinbrã¼ck be not worthy of become chancellor mr. schulz say
some of the warm applause ms. merkel receive from the crowd on tuesday come when she praise europe as a place in which freedom of speech religion the medium and association be guarantee
the line a stump speech staple resonate more here than in the west and to whistle heckler she add the zinger that yes even in magdeburg there be no price to pay for disagree with her 1

it have style flair and a short compelling menu devise by jacob hamilton the chef who formerly work for todd english in new york
it be own by two brother mario and jaime lopez and their partner gustavo jaramillo
the dining room which run the length of the building and seat 70 be stylish too with crystal chandelier with gauzy red shade a wood floor and a communal table in the center

there be six starter choice and seven entree they sound intriguing and those we try be prettily plat and generally very good
top for creativity be an appetizer of king salmon tartare
a generous stack of chop fresh salmon speckle with shallot and fiery jalapeã±o rest on a bed of arugula with both black and pink peppercorn scatter on the plate a most attractive presentation
crunchy fried calamari another starter be serve in abundance along with a mildly spice marinara dip
eggplant parmesan with prosciutto and mascarpone sound lovely
but the reality be not as fresh tasting or as exhilarating as the other starter
as for the prix fixe entree we love the radiant freshness of the house make pea tortellini four or five pasta pillow fill with sweet pea cook in brown butter with a tang of honey on a plate decorate with fresh pea shoot and tendril
another pasta dish fusilli combine roasted cauliflower garlic and olive oil and radiate tantalizing aroma
it taste as good as it look but it need more olive oil which our waiter willingly supply to moisten and enliven the dish
we also enjoy the pan sear shrimp succulent jumbos in a swirl of lobster sauce and accompany by a barley salad with pea mushroom and carrot
the pan sear striped bass on the other hand be a bit overcooked for my taste
it be team however with a refreshing barley asparagus salad jazz up with a tangy lemon vinaigrette
the regular ã la carte dinner menu also have some very good choice generally well prepared
our dinner begin with excellent crusty focaccia serve gratis with first rate aria extra virgin olive oil that have a few bead of olive tapenade float in it
among the first course we love the piping hot grilled squid exceedingly tender and fresh tasting with white cannellini bean and cherry tomato anchor in a luscious herb rich sauce
equally pleasing be the nicely brown crunchy top crab cake make with maryland lump crab meat which come alongside a flawlessly dress arugula salad with fresh tomato and a zesty cherry pepper sauce
crispy artichoke be another delight though the dress on the accompany green salad could have benefit from a touch more vinegar
an entree of baked salmon arrive with an engaging potpourri of veggie pea green bean lima bean asparagus carrot spring onion and radish
another dish pan sear red snapper be plat with a crisp risotto cake tomato ragã¹ mussel olive spinach and smoke sweet paprika oil
both fish order be expertly cook
dessert be few but two of those we try be noteworthy a warm brown sugary apple cobbler and tiramisã¹.
the pistachio gelato be to my taste a tad too sweet

the rockwell small town rock chair the old fashioned house with the welcome mat the genial family doctor the grandfather clock there they be depict in all their lifelike apparently cozy detail
both rockwell and king know such detail intimately right down to the brand name

danny survive both his evil infested dad jack torrance and the ghoul that inhabit the grisly overlook hotel in colorado escape by the hair of his chinny chin chin just before the clock strike midnight and the hotel 's infernal boiler blow up incinerate the force of bad and leave reader hide under the bed but cross eye with relief
in doctor sleep dan have grow up but he retain his shin ability
have wrestle the demon drink to an uneasy standstill his father have that problem too as we recall he ' attend a.a. and work at a hospice facility where with his mind probe talent he help the die to reconcile themselves to their often misspent life
thus his nickname doctor sleep which echo his childhood nickname doc

this be a whole new twist on steampunk
the knot member have be alive for a very long time not usually a good sign as those who know their dracula and

feisty young woman chase around sweden track down killer be by no mean the only people with dragon tattoo on their flesh
the middle aged french canadian gallery owner at the center of robert lepage 's slight but move work the blue dragon at the brooklyn academy of music 's harvey theater through sunday have a similar creature snake across his back an emblem of his reverence for chinese culture and his adopt home
mr. lepage most famous or be that infamous
in new york now for his controversial and expensive production of wagner 's ring for the metropolitan opera have a long career behind him as a theater auteur he write direct and sometimes act in production for his ex machina company
the blue dragon originally stag in 2009 be a small scale sequel of sort to his more epic five hour plus dragons trilogy from 1985
this show run an intermissionless hour and 50 minute and be perform in english french and mandarin with english supertitle
mr. lepage portray pierre lamontagne a central figure in the dragons trilogy whose life be take up 20 year after the end of that work
pierre have leave canada behind to forge a life in shanghai as a gallery owner his ambition to create art of his own have be set aside
his affair with a young chinese artist whose show he be present xiao ling tai wei foo hit a rough patch when a lover from his past claire forãªt marie michaud arrive in shanghai on a quest to adopt a baby
claire and pierre have reach point in their life at which decision make in their youth be circle back to haunt them and at which decision make now can involve momentous irreversible change
claire too have leave the art world to become an advertising executive but now see the shelf life of her career shorten before her as young colleague keep apace with the disorient change in medium and culture
pierre 's life have suddenly become precarious the chinese authorities be plan to expropriate the property where he have long live along with many other artist to build a train station
both mr. lepage and ms. michaud who together write the script for the blue dragon give subdued delicate and emotionally resonant performance
we sense quickly how easily pierre and claire re establish their rapport while the question of what may have be between them they marry for mercenary purpose to gain more grant money and never divorce lingers quietly in the background like music just faintly hear
when claire 's bid to adopt go awry she feel herself even more at loose end but she strike up a friendship with xiao ling that lead to an unexpected development
xiao ling have become pregnant they discover one day when an expedition to the zoo be interrupt by a bout of morning sickness
chinese cultural dictate make it difficult for single woman to raise child on their own
could her unwanted baby be a stroke of happy fortune for claire
the blue dragon move with the cinematic fluidity emblematic of much of mr. lepage 's work
i keep reflect that the production seem almost design for film
it open with movie style credit during which ms. tai dance in traditional costume before the screen on which the credit appear
and the action be mostly confine to a narrow two level strip of stage that give the show a kind of two dimensional feeling as if we be watch the whole thing unfold on a screen
film may also amplify the impact of the performance
aside from a single scene of conflict in which pierre and claire trade recrimination and accusation after a tense night the blue dragon rely on minor key emotional development that the actor to their credit never overplay but that do not necessarily register strongly enough to engage an audience in a large theater
i have the odd feeling that i be watch a quiet finely etch indie movie on an iphone and lose too much of the detail
mr. lepage do supply some nifty directorial sleight of hand as when two white sheet slide slowly across the stage to indicate a thin layer of snowfall
and as always his integration of video imagery by david leclerc be seamless and sometimes witty
one interstitial segment appear to be an old style chinese martial art movie set in the legendary past until patty of fry chicken appear in the hand of the warrior it ' a chinese ad for kfc. the blue dragon end on a movingly ambiguous note
earlier xiao ling tell claire the grim legend of how woman with unwanted baby once dispose of them by throw them into the yangtze river and let the three gorge decide their fate a new family death by drown or a return to the place where they be abandon
evoke this legend mr. lepage and ms. michaud conclude the show by offer three provisional ending all plausible and rewarding on their own term but each leave one of the three character wave a bittersweet goodbye to the other two suggest that whatever the future hold someone will end up abandon and alone

san francisco kids
the reckless rant and picture they post online can often get them in trouble by compromise their chance of get into a good college or even land them in jail
what to do about such lapse vexes parent school official the internet company that host their word and image and the law
now california legislator be try to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minor the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretion
the legislation put the state in the middle of a turbulent debate over how best to protect child and their privacy on the internet and whether state should even be try to tame the web
the governor jerry brown have take no position on the bill
he have until mid october to sign it after which without his signature the legislation become law
california be often in the vanguard when it come to digital privacy
it be the first state to require company to report data breach and it require web site and mobile apps to post privacy policy that explain how personal information be use
a recently pass law require web site to tell user whether they honor browser do not track signal
the right to delete or eraser provision be part of a broad bill that prohibit web site which have actual knowledge that a minor be use the site base on a profile and activity on the site from run ad for a range of product include alcohol spray paint tattoo tanning bed and e cigarette
the eraser section compel online site to let user under 18 delete rant tweet picture status update and other material
although many company include facebook and twitter already offer this option to their user the california bill would make it a right across the internet for child who live in that state
kid and teenager often self reveal before they self reflect say james steyer chief executive of common sense media a san francisco base advocacy group that push for the law
it ' a very important milestone
the rash revelation by a texas teenager justin carter on facebook last february a threatened school shoot his family insist be sarcastic make in the heat of play a video game land him in a texas jail on a felony terrorism charge for nearly six month
his father jack favor the california legislation but wonder if it would go far enough
they should be allow to delete it but then again be it really delete
mr. carter 39 of san antonio say in an interview this week
also mr. carter say if his son have delete the conversation that someone report to the authorities would the deletion be see as destroy evidence
his son now 19 be out on a bond pending trial
any law try to tame the internet he say be likely to run into turbulence
it ' a whole new territory it grow fast than the law do mr. carter say
we 're try to come up with thing to make it all neat
there ' collateral damage my son be one of them
critic of an eraser law see pitfall
they warn that in try to protect child the law could unwittingly put them at risk by dig deeper into their personal life
to comply with the law for example company would have to collect more information about their customer include whether they be under 18 and whether they be in california
there be also practical concern
if other state pass similar law company would be force to devise multiple policy for the underage resident of different state confuse consumer and create unwieldy requirement for web business that be essentially stateless except for issue like collect sale tax
the internet opponent of the law say should be regulate by a uniform set of rule not piecemeal by the state
this be well mean legislation but there be concern about it say stephen balkam president of the family online safety institute which advise company like facebook and microsoft on online safety issue
mr. balkam say he favor congressional oversight in issue like child 's online privacy and if necessary regulation by the federal trade commission
where california lead others follow he say
i think it will be a mess
some supporter of the bill say internet company get off easy
the eraser bill do not for example require company to remove the delete data from its server altogether nor do it offer any way to delete material that have be share by others a sensational picture that have go viral in other word can not be purge from the internet
and it be nothing like the right to be forget measure that legislator in europe have be press for
that proposal would at its core allow all europeans not just child to delete their online personal information several amendment to the plan address freedom of expression concern
it ' an important first step but there ' more to be do mr. steyer say
mr. steyer 's organization which participate in a safety advisory group with facebook but soon leave after disagreement with the company 's approach have be push for more aggressive legislation
those effort in 2011 lead member of congress to propose a measure that would have allow parent to scrub material post by their child
criticize by free speech advocate the bill go nowhere though senator edward j. markey democrat of massachusetts who be a co sponsor plan to introduce it again later this year
short of federal privacy law in general state have be pass law on a host of privacy matter in many case follow california 's lead
often you need to comply with the most restrictive state as a practical matter because the internet do not really have state boundary say mali friedman a lawyer in the san francisco office of covington burling a national law firm
bank regulator around the world be force bank to hold more capital than they do before the financial crisis reveal just how inadequate their capital truly be
but one set of american bank appear to be on the verge of keep the right to have no capital at all
that group be the money market fund which function as bank but historically have have the best of all regulatory world no capital requirement no reserve no fee for deposit insurance and a belief by their customer that they be at least as safe as bank
this week the comment period close on proposed money market rule set forth by the securities and exchange commission
the rule be pitifully weak and inadequate
they could even make the system more vulnerable in a crisis as the president of all 12 federal reserve bank point out in a letter to the s.e.c.
but that have not stop the mutual fund industry from try to weaken them even more
by coincidence the deadline for comment be on thursday just five day after the fifth anniversary of the collapse of lehman brothers
it be that collapse that reveal to all just how shaky the money market industry be
the answer be or ought to be remarkably simple they either have to be bank or mutual fund paul a. volcker the former federal reserve chairman tell me in an interview
if they be bank promise to pay at par on demand they should be regulate like bank
if they be mutual fund they should be regulate like mutual fund
but such a sensible proposal would outrage the money market fund industry which have lobby politician intensely
it be perhaps the big embarrassment of mary schapiro 's tenure as chairwoman of the s.e.c. that she be unable to persuade a majority of commissioner to propose any reform of the industry
so her successor mary jo white be praise when she manage to get the commission to unanimously put out the two rule for comment
surely something be better than nothing
well in this case perhaps not
one proposed rule call for allow the net asset value of money market fund to fluctuate
currently fund price their share at $ 1 round to the near penny and promise they will remain there
in practice that mean that as long as the value remain at or above 99.5 cent the fund will not break the buck
the s.e.c. proposal would stretch that round out to the near hundredth of a penny
but the s.e.c. proposal would not actually do very much
fund that invest primarily in government security would not face a float net asset value
nor would so call retail money market fund which allow investor to withdraw no more than $ 1 million at a time
even those few fund that would be subject to the rule would be able to use an exist s.e.c. rule that usually let them assume market price be equal to par value for any security that will mature within 60 day
the fact that the proposal would do little have not stop the industry from complain
fund company want to change the definition of retail fund
some suggest raise the limit to $ 5 million
others say that as long as the investor have a social security number the fund should be deem retail
the other s.e.c. proposal set up an elaborate procedure that would allow but not require money market fund that have experience a lot of redemption to either impose a fee on redemption or to simply suspend such payment for 30 day
this be call the gate proposal because it erect gate to protect fund
and what be the virtue of that
well it would prevent or at least delay a run on any fund that get in trouble
if protect the fund and not its investor be the top priority maybe that make sense
but in reality it probably would do more harm than good
as eric s. rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston write in a letter sign by all the other regional fed president a fund could run low on liquidity and thus initiate the gate proposal if a couple of large investor in the fund withdraw their money for any reason
that could scare investor in other fund that seem similar in some way produce more run and more gate
as this represent a new run mechanism that do not exist under the status quo the fee and gate alternative may actually increase run risk relative to not enact further reform mr. rosengren write
to much of the industry there be no problem at all
what happen in a 2008 be a once in a generation scenario that be unlikely to recur as a lawyer for one money market fund group federated investors put it in a comment letter
any further reform he add should be design to preserve the utility of money market fund 1 2 next page

before the metamorphosis arthur pita 's dance theater adaptation of franz kafka 's novella officially begin the stage tell a story
on one side be a kitchen where a mother dry silverware a father hunch over a newspaper and a pigtailed daughter lie on the floor check her homework
on the other be edward watson recumbent in bed with a white sheet pull up to his chest
eerily his body seem trap
even as he lift his head off the pillow and slowly roll it side to side he remain otherwise still
in the metamorphosis which be see wednesday at the joyce theater a travel salesman wake up to find that he have be transform into a gruesome insect
like kafka 's character mr. watson 's gregor samsa be oddly matter of fact about his predicament he also never completely part with his humanity even as his parent and eventually grete his young sister accept the transformation with equal part acceptance and revulsion
set to an ominous score by frank moon who can go overboard with his insect in the night vocalization the metamorphosis feature impressive visual design simon daw 's set which feature a move wall contrast between the grotesque creature with its sterile surroundings
dark brown sludge seep out of gregor 's mouth eventually turn his bedroom into a streaky mudslide that conjure a blood soak carrie
if only there be more tension in mr. pita 's increasingly long wind production which open the joyce theater 's fall season and be originally produce by the royal ballet in 2011
much care be devote to gregor 's pre insect existence in which his routine be establish he rise from bed dress put an apple in his bag and catch a train
here mr. watson 's precision be unflinching
but the transformation from salesman to insect be more abrupt than macabre
even worse be the sense that this insect have study yoga
it do not matter what a pair of long leg be do there be still no place in the metamorphosis for a shoulder stand
still mr. watson a celebrated royal ballet principal possess a spindly ranginess that be affect especially as he use his joint to etch razor sharp angle
roll on his back he extend his leg in the air and point and flex his toe
thread an arm in between his thigh and wrap it around the outside of his calf he curve his spine in a deep contraction without lose his strange define prickliness
duet with his mother nina goldman and grete corey annand be more obvious often they expose little more than partner mechanic
grete an aspire ballerina in this version struggle to straighten gregor 's leg and arm but he be slinkyesque
there ' no way to stretch him back into a man
mr. watson 's gregor have more to do with spirit than the knotting and unknotting of muscle
when it work the struggle be internal confusion yearning and despondency be nakedly reveal in his forlorn eye
david hallberg would be good in this would not he
for all its predictability gregor samsa be still a meaty role for a ballet dancer it ' a chance to get down and dirty

if you want an interesting perspective on a police procedural watch it with a real police officer
if you want insight into the accuracy of a medical drama watch it with a doctor
it ' too bad there be no late-14th- or early-15th century british king around with whom to watch the hollow crown a four part serving of shakespeare that begin on friday on pbs 's great performances
think of the question you could ask do you guy really make a habit of spout eloquent eulogy and speech at improbable time
be there really practically no woman in england then except mrs. weasley from the harry potter movie
do king ever do any actual governing or do they just fight and fret about who be or be not try to unseat them of course your pestering may just earn you a beheading which seem to have be the method prefer by king and would be king of yore for make annoyance go away
a couple of head be graphically lop off in richard ii
friday 's opening installment of the series which also include on successive friday henry iv part 1 henry iv part 2 and henry v.
those tumble head be worth note
first let 's get this caveat out of the way nothing beat a stage performance of a shakespeare play if the cast be first rate and the direction insightful
that say a television or film treatment can be helpful especially for the uninitiated and especially for these play which be not as well know or audience friendly as say romeo and juliet
when a full battle be call for you see a battlefield with horse and army
when a chorus recitation be demand it be recite by john hurt over footage of a ship at sea embark on a cross channel invasion
and when head must be sever pity poor bushy and green in richard ii the director rupert goold have the option of show you the unpleasant act and he take it
shakespeare have it occur offstage
there be bloody moment in the hollow crown but not gratuitously so
these be high stake play and graphically render death underscore that in a way that a stage production ca n't
for the most part the flexibility that television provide be use to good advantage in the hollow crown to clarify the action and enhance the dynamic
only occasionally do it feel misplaced as in richard ii when mr. goold go all in with jesus imagery
to have richard view himself as a christ figure be fine but here it seem more the director 's choice than the king 's
group the four play together provide the chance for a study in kingly contrast and the actor and director provide it
jeremy irons among the most familiar cast member to american audience in these british production be henry iv in the middle two play direct by richard eyre and give you pretty much what you would expect from mr. irons solidity fury precision
most interesting be ben whishaw 's airy effeminate richard ii a character who can not seem to decide whether to be protective of his power or indifferent to it
richard 's best speech come late in the play as he be lose his grip on both reality and his throne to the advance henry bolingbroke rory kinnear who the next time we meet him have turn into king henry iv and mr. irons
prince hal eventually to be henry v be play by tom hiddleston who ably transition from the devil may care fellow of henry iv part 1 to the serious monarch of henry v direct by thea sharrock
he may not make anyone forget kenneth branagh 's 1989 film portrayal just as this henry v as a whole do not outshine that one but he have his moment especially the scene from henry iv part 1 in which he kill hotspur and then pronounce one of those incongruously move spur of the moment epitaph
there be character other than king in these play of course among them julie walters of the harry potter film as mistress
quickly one of the few female role of any size
the most beloved be surely falstaff and simon russell beale have great fun with the role make the portly fellow feel like a person rather than a mere buffoon
great performances

a newly engage couple have have us to dinner at their place a few time

at around 10:30 or 11 p.m. the woman cuddle up to her fiance pull a blanket over herself and fall asleep
meanwhile the fiance be happily awake and offer us nightcaps
we feel hugely awkward
my husband be good friend with the guy and we would love to stick around and chat but the sleep body make it less enticing
how should we handle this
anonymous new york leave taking be the most complicated part of many dinner party stay long enough to signal our enjoyment and appreciation without tip into that dread zone know to host as how can we miss you if you wo not go away

a gracious exit be even tough here where your host be send mixed signal
his nightcap may suggest do n't move a muscle
but her rendition of sleepy time gal be decidedly even if unconsciously scream enough already
simply stand up and in a quiet voice so as not to wake sleep beauty say it ' get late
let 's pick this up next time
if the gentleman host be unhappy with the earlier than he desire departure of dinner guest he will admonish his fiancee in private i hope to keep her eye open longer
and if your husband have load more to discuss with his pal reciprocate quickly
or let the two of them meet up for lunch
but stay put while your hostess be pass out seem irremediably awkward not to mention creepy
do not take her nodding off as any negative judgment about you
she may be tired especially if she do a full day 's work then cook a fancy dinner
and be i the only one who think 11 p.m. be pretty late
learn to socialize with couple take time more move part
so if you like these folk keep at it
in the meantime here ' your hat what ' your hurry
identity crisis i have an unusual name that can be intimidate on paper but be very easy to pronounce once instruct
i have teach people my whole life
but my in law my parent in law brother- and sister in law and now their young child still do not say it correctly even though my husband and i have be marry for more than a decade
we have try to correct them sporadically over the year only to be meet with be we really say it that differently
my feeling have evolve from amused to annoyed and insult
be i be oversensitive
anonymous newburyport mass.
of course not
as jim croce sing approximately four million year ago like the pine tree line the wind road you get a name you get a name
and your in law owe it to you to pronounce it correctly
let 's assume they start out flummox by it which over time turn to fear and denial and your sporadic attempt at remedial education have be insufficient
this may be kind than they deserve but you have not sketch out any other cruelty so we will keep to the sunny side of the street
the next time you be all together sit down with your husband and tell them listen it ' be a decade and it ' not that hard a name
then do a call and response repetition until even the tiny child can pull it off without a hitch
go big and go home a victor
it ' worth the effort
we all learn to pronounce zach galifianakis correct
recropping the photos
my amazing guy and i have be together for 10 year and marry for 2
but his ex wife continue to package photograph of the good old day include romantic moment between them and have them deliver by their 20-year old daughter
he immediately rip them up and throw them out but i want to let her know that she need to move on
any thought
anonymous vancouver keep quiet about the whole business
it be none of your concern and your husband be handle it
and for the record i would be just as jealous and upset as you
my only thought be that your husband should not be destroy these photograph but store them in the attic or basement
there may come a day when he want to revisit that period of his life and it will have no bearing on his love for you

the puck building the inimitable epicenter of soho industrial swank even before there be a soho have be around for 128 yearsâ but defy its age with the tenacity of an uptown socialite
all it take be good bone structure ton of money and a win personality the first supply by henry baerer 's two saucy statue of shakespeare 's mischievous puck on the building 's exterior the last by the genius of the puck 's original architect albert wagner
the essential contemporary attribute in the middle a bottomless bankroll be traceable to jared kushner 32 a scion of the family that own the puck
it ' a gorgeous magical building mr. kushner say but i want it to become the most incredible that it could be let it realize its full potential
the truth be that a lot of old building if they 're not properly invest in become tired old building
i want to take an icon and not just preserve it but improve it
he ' be at it for eight year and in 2011 survive a three month tussle with the landmarks preservation commission to consolidate his mission mr. kushner saw the puck 's future and it be penthouse
after rule out a rooftop boutique hotel or restaurant he opt to take the luxury condominium route as the most appropriate mode of ratchet up the puck 's relevance to the 21st century downtown real estate market
he be now crown the already regal building with six loft style residence to be call the puck penthouses
five will replace what have be disused office space on the eighth and ninth floor with a sixth to be build on the roof
they have their own private entrance behind a puck blue door at 295 lafayette street an elegant lobby with a cast iron fireplace import from europe and an amusing stain glass caricature of puck by the elevator
mr. kushner come up with that novel but expensive decor enhancer while tour church in prague with his wife ivanka trump
he have a hard time not think about work
each home be configure differently one be finish and all be intend as artisanal masterworks right down to their limit edition la cornue stove from france bullet shape h. theophile door hinge and custom kolbe mahogany frame window with build in uv protection for art and furniture
mr. kushner rip out the window he originally commission after decide they be not picture perfect
cherished holdover from yesteryear include flute iron column ash insulation and brick barrel vault ceiling circa 1885
i realize very early on that while it ' still relatively early in my overall career there be a really good chance that i would never again have an opportunity to work on a project this unique say mr. kushner who spend at least three day a week on the construction site and be not shy about scold anyone who forget to put dust slipper over his or her shoe before enter pristine no
ph vi roman numeral be so much more imperial than regular old number
there a site supervisor he nickname mariano rivera be in charge of put the finishing touch on a 4,895-square foot three bedroom four and a half bath residence price at $ 21 million
its opulent 1,600-square foot master suite overlook another downtown landmark the basilica of st. patrick 's old cathedral and picturesque cemetery
it ' always nice to know you will have quiet neighbor mr. kushner say
the penthouse of which only ph vi be market ready range from $ 21 million to $ 60 million two will be duplex three will have outdoor space and three overlook a roof garden
whether mr. kushner 's taste and vision turn out to be tailor make for the luxury downtown marketplace have yet to be determine but pamela liebman the president of the corcoran group be impressed after a recent tour
this be what everybody think a loft in soho should look like but can never find she say add there ' so much money out there now chase large apartment
i think anyone who live there be go to feel important

they do not make them like this anymore genteel old fashioned restaurant with beautiful tile and intricate carefully maintain mural frame by rich dark wood with enough space among table that conversation can remain private where music do not boom and blare where service be calm and patron unrushed
aquario be such a place
that may explain why even though the kitchen have its ups and down the restaurant have enjoy two decade across the road from silver lake in west harrison
one recent weekend evening two of the party room be take and the main dining room call the tagus river room fill up quickly
the mural depict such a sunny idyllic life on the river and among the grapevine that we wonder about book a seat on the next flight to lisbon
today 's diet have catch up with what aquario have be serve since its inception seafood and a luscious variety of seasonal vegetable
but before the main course nibble on a few black olive or slice of linguiã§a a salty portuguese sausage tasty treat that may go with say a lime load caipirinha a fruity sangria or a husky portuguese red
a simple arugula and radicchio salad with forgettable french and astringent avocado dressing on the side and the caldo verde an overly salt soup with grainy potato could easily be give the go by
better starter be to come like cool sweet honeydew overlay with prosciutto and two small smooth squid stuff with a mince of vegetable and shrimp and bath in a shallow pool of sheer tomato sauce
good bread make handy sop for this and other sauce like the sweet garlic that come with tender broil octopus
the snail in cognac sauce be say to be a favorite first course here and we can understand why even if they be an odd entry on the menu at aquario which describe itself as a portuguese and brazilian restaurant
serve over perfectly cook linguine they make an ultrarich and delectable dish
the generous dose of cognac in the pale tomato cream sauce deliver a heady aroma and taste
the decent green new zealand mussel lack balance however flood by a nonetheless tasty spread of thick semi molten cut of tomato onion and colorful sweet pepper
entree have their high and low as well
portuguese stew be a personal favorite but here it may be better to stick with those that exclude pork like mariscada or the fisherman 's rice stew with shellfish
one stew do in the style of the alentejo region of portugal include cube of dry lean pork which detract from the goodness of the clam and cilantro rich wine sauce carry this dish
they do the same for an otherwise win paelha which be heap with good seafood chicken and saffron rice
less intricate fish preparation be more successful
serve with a brown butter sauce on the side whole dover sole be saute perfectly as be a thick cut of moist swordfish cover with soft luscious balsamic onion
firm and meaty monkfish receive the restaurant 's signature medley of fresh tomato onion and sweet pepper
but still too tough and salty the bacalao salt cod could have use another day of rinse and soak
a panoply of vegetable accompany the fish entree
expect an appropriate variety from a seasonal stock that in early september include cauliflower broccoli carrot string bean tomato and not least onion and sweet green and red pepper
a dish of rice and black bean be also serve
in the wake of such hearty food dessert be hard to contemplate
yet when a dessert tray of almost a dozen selection be present we relent
most of the cake and tart be unremarkable but we enjoy mini custard tart pasteis de nata a huge baked apple not too sweet eggy flan and especially a choice of seasonal fruit include ripe fig and that sweet honeydew from the appetizer list

vinalhaven maine visit robert indiana 's remote maine mansion arch beautiful and borderline bizarre and you will find a man and an artist surround and haunt by love.
the word that be image of mr. indiana 's 1966 signature work love its four letter color and cubed hang on his wall sit on his shelf and peek through his window
it ' emblazon on poster depict in painting hew in marble and sew in sequin
it ' in english and in spanish and hebrew and chinese
and it be cast on coffee mug splash across magazine cover and on the side of a pair of high top converses
have you see one of my contribution to american culture mr. indiana say
so that all of our athlete can be properly shoe if you detect a touch of ambivalence antipathy even toward the word from the man who create it you be not mistaken
indeed while love make mr. indiana famous around the world success come at a steep price some say namely a lack of critical reckoning give many of his pop art peer like warhol oldenburg and lichtenstein
he be in some way both neglect and overexpose
i be a father to a bad child mr. indiana say
it bite me
in particular mr. indiana say because love with its tilt o be not properly copyright it spread to all sort of place and product he do not want
and that break his heart
rip offs have do a great harm to my own reputation he say
but this week restore that critical appreciation will be the goal of a new exhibition at the whitney museum of american art bill as the first major american museum retrospective of mr. indiana 's work
it ' long overdue the artist say during a recent visit to his home on an island in penobscot bay a pollock like splatter of land about 15 mile off rockland
i be famous in the 60
i be have this retrospective in 2013
well that ' take quite a while
it ' a show that its curator barbara haskell name robert indiana beyond love both to credit mr. indiana as the creator of one of pop art 's best know piece and to move him past it
for his career it ' really be problematic because of the sheer ubiquity of it she say
and i think it ' blind people to the depth of his work
ms. haskell say she hop to show that while his work have this dazzling bold hard edge surface the subtext be all conceptually very complicated
john wilmerding an emeritus professor of american art at princeton say that mr. indiana like other pop artist draw from contemporary consumer culture as well as printing and advertising
but he add mr. indiana be more of an outlier mark by his fondness for literary touch and abstraction
many historian would argue he ' on the margin on pop he say
and i would place him there too
ms. haskell have include less know work many of which include the symbol common to mr. indiana 's prodigious and more famous output
there be numeral and circle star and herm the narrow sculpture affix with wheel which resemble roman mile marker
and of course there be word short simple message like eat and die more on this later man and sex.
for better or bad though no single word have mean more to mr. indiana 's career than love which begin as an image on a christmas card and end up as a series of large sculpture see everywhere from taipei to wichita
i 'm sure all the people who have be bear 20 year ago do not know anything about me at all except love,'â say mr. indiana add with a mischievous glint
and that ' a nasty word
get old can make people blunt and mr. indiana 85 and in falter health be blunt
ask about pop art for instance and he say he be a reluctant member of the movement
i do not like be identify in that way he say
the very name be a trifle
how can you take something like p o p seriously he ask
similarly inquire about the current state of american art and you get this too many artist too many gallery and too many people interested in art
and those too many people be not very interesting he add 1 2 next page

in the air be something of a departure for mr. wilcox 47 who have always come across as a kind of romantic miniaturist
he be best know for film only a few minute long and often loop that be piece together from all kind of existing footage
sometimes he would reshoot the find film several time to achieve grainy fog of memory texture still image and brief tabletop sequence that he shoot himself be other staple
these work be intimate handmade reverie cryptic yet resonant with outsize theme history death love fame
mix fact and fiction they conjure historic figure like marlene dietrich or alexander the great but could also be autobiographical
while mr. wilcox 's early effort be most memorable when project small with in the air he go big and it work
he seem to have do this almost reflexively spur by the astounding 360-degree view from his studio to which he move from a low floor in the same building two year ago
paralysis be his first response to this spectacular sight
he have say more than once that he initially spend so much time look at the view that he think he may stop make art altogether
but in the end he use the beautiful implacable city as the setting and also the motivate force for a half dozen miniaturist narrative expand his collage aesthetic without sacrifice its intimacy
after considerable trial and error and some uncooperative weather mr. wilcox be finally able in july to shoot about 15 hour worth of one day in the life of new york city
it take several week for condition to align
consistent with his preference for low tech gear he downgrade his equipment from five complicated camera to the same number of relatively small rugged inexpensive gopros
he also switch from filming to shooting still which improve resolution
and he pray for sun attend by sky that be not completely cloudless and boring
he end up with 60,000 still shoot at a rate of one per second
these be individually process and then animate and speed up use a computer program that seamlessly stitch the view together eliminate distortion and even light level
the majesty and clarity of this wraparound vista be stunning
the city look old almost timeless without the detail of street traffic and storefront
the sight include the con edison clock tower zeckendorf towers freedom tower and the west side with glimpse of the hudson and new jersey
the sun appear and set cloud of many different shade and shape push their shadow across the mass of architecture airplane arrive and depart the light of the city come on and then dim as the sun return
this flat footed documentary approach evoke andy warhol 's deadpan all but motionless 1964 classic empire that eight hour stationary shot of the empire state building but mr. wilcox be too much of a storyteller to leave it at this
superimpose on the panorama be six short cameo film in a way detail that pull us from one place or era one event or personality to another across vary film method between color and black and white
the cameo appear one at a time on different part of the screen each with its own title form a carefully link loop of narrative
some draw on mr. wilcox 's life

on the horizon remember the prominent fashion illustrator antonio lopez string together image of his work and film footage and still of him and also of break dancer perform in his studio
a book of mr. lopez 's drawing and polaroids that mr. wilcox saw as a teenager ignite his desire to be in new york but by the time he arrive the scene that attract him be be ravage by aids which take mr. lopez 's life in 1987 at the age of 44

in kevin and me a video by the black performance artist dave mckenzie the camera focus downward on the artist 's leg and foot as he walk along a wood plank pedestrian bridge
one of his leg be twist cause him to limp
as he advance he begin to walk more naturally until he ' move normally at which point he stop to doff his sneaker and put on a pair of tap shoe await him at a steel joint in the walkway
he then execute a series of precise dance step along the narrow metal band
movie buff will recognize this as a clever riff on the end of the usual suspects in which verbal kint play by kevin spacey morphs from the loquacious simpleton he ' be pretend to be into the criminal mastermind he really be
see the video in radical presence black performance in contemporary art an entertaining and philosophically stimulating exhibition at new york university 's grey art gallery viewer may also read it as an allegory about be black in today 's america
too often our still white dominate mass entertainment medium portray black man as belong to one of two group a large one of bum defectives and criminal and a tiny one of magically gifted athlete musician and comedian leave a broad sector of more or less ordinary black citizen underrepresented
a remarkable thing about the exhibition be that much of it be in a comical vein like mr. mckenzie 's work
the show be organize by valerie cassel oliver senior curator at the contemporary arts museum houston where it open last november
one of the earliest piece be david hammons 's bliz aard ball sale document here in a slide show
for that 1983 work mr. hammons stand outdoors on a new york sidewalk selling snowball neatly array on a blanket at his foot
from more recent time there ' a series of video by jayson musson who have make a name for himself as the youtube personality hennessy youngman
wear his own version of hip hop style bling with a spider man cap for example and use street slang he deliver hilarious acutely informed lecture on topic like the female gaze and relational aesthetic
in 2003 jean ulrick desert enact negerhosen2000/the travel albums in which he travel around germany wear pink lederhosen
his wandering be document in the exhibition through a series of souvenir photomontage feature snapshot of him pose with people he encounter
in one he ' with a group of white haired tourist
a handwritten note recall they enjoy the lightness of negerhosen/2000 and marvel at the gravity of its implication
more than two dozen artist be represent in this show and not all of their work take a humorous approach
for example in pretending to be rock 1993 sherman fleming stay on hand and knee under drip candle until he could no longer bear the wax accumulate on his naked back
but since a strain of purposeful absurdity as oppose to say didactic righteousness can be find in almost every piece in the show mr. desert 's observation could apply to the exhibition as a whole
that ' not just incidental
comedy often turn on contradiction between appearance and reality
mistaken identity abound in shakespeare 's comedy and in modern movie like trade place in which eddie murphy be transform from a street level con man into a wealthy investor whose polished demeanor fool the financial elite
many of the exhibition 's work involve deceptive appearance
in 1973 adrian piper do a series of outdoor guerrilla performance as the mythic being a menacing man with a mustache and an afro wig
in the early 80 lorraine o'grady go to new york art opening as mlle bourgeoise noire wear a tiara and a floor length gown make of stitch together white glove
in a soap operatic video call conversations wit de churen ii all my churen kalup linzy appear in several guise female as well as male talk in various dialect
for eat the wall street journal william pope
l who bill himself as the friendly black artist in america appear as a combination madman and shaman
wear only a jockstrap and boot he sit on a toilet at the top of a 10-foot high tower and consume the journal in strip with the help of ketchup and milk
among the reason for this penchant for role playing in black performance you may cite w. e. b. du bois 's notion of double consciousness the experience of see yourself through the eye of others rather than as you know yourself to be
to exaggerate the disparity between outer and inner comically or otherwise can be a way to unsettle prejudicial idea about identity
but there ' more to it than that
between appearance and reality imaginative field may open for the emergence of new reality and other way of be not only black or white but human
if the sci fi psychedelic digitally animate video by the young artist and dancer jacolby satterwhite bear 1986 presage the future of black performance it ' one that ' pregnant with mind stretch possibility
for immediate purpose there ' another half of the exhibition still to come
part ii will open at the studio museum in harlem on nov. 14
many live performance be schedule for the run of both show include a series coordinate with this year 's biennial performance extravaganza performa 13 nov. 1 to 24

one be the so call golden madonna a statue of the virgin and child carve from linden wood overlay with sheet of hammer gold
although both its figure be headless now with their light glance surface stud with gemstone they be magnetically opulent and must once have be even more so
church record report that in the 15th century the sculpture be half bury in pile of brooch ring and necklace leave as offering
more be more be the modus operandi of medieval aesthetic and the show have textbook example begin with a gospel own by bernward

after his death and maybe to celebrate his election to sainthood the cover be further adorn with robin' egg size crystal and miniature painting

washington house republicans narrowly push through a bill on thursday that slash billion of dollar from the food stamp program over the objection of democrats and a veto threat from president obama
the vote set up what promise to be a major clash with the senate and dash hope for passage this year of a new five year farm bill
the vote be 217 to 210 largely along party line
republican leader under pressure from tea party back conservative say the bill be need because the food stamp program which cost nearly $ 80 billion a year have grow out of control
they say the program have expand even as jobless rate have decline with the ease recession
this bill eliminate loophole ensure work requirement and put us on a fiscally responsible path say representative marlin stutzman republican of indiana who lead effort to split the food stamp program from the overall farm bill
in the real world we measure success by result
it ' time for washington to measure success by how many family be lift out of poverty and help back on their foot not by how much washington bureaucrat spend year after year
but even with the cut the food stamp program would cost more than $ 700 billion over the next 10 year
republicans invoke former president bill clinton in their defense of the bill say that the change be in the spirit of those that he sign into law in 1996 that set work requirement for those who receive welfare
but democrats many of whom hold up picture of people they say would lose their benefit call the cut draconian and say they would plunge million into poverty
it ' a sad day in the people 's house when the leadership bring to the floor one of the most heartless bill i have ever see say representative james mcgovern democrat of massachusetts
it ' terrible policy trap in a terrible process
the measure have little chance of advance in the senate and senator debbie stabenow democrat of michigan and the chairwoman of the senate agriculture committee call it a monumental waste of time
the bill write under the direction of the house majority leader eric cantor republican of virginia would cut $ 40 billion from the food stamp program over the next 10 year
it would also require adult between 18 and 50 without minor child to find a job or to enroll in a work training program in order to receive benefit
it would also limit the time those recipient could get benefit to three month
currently state can extend food stamp benefit past three month for able bodied people who be work or prepare for work as part of a job training program
this bill make get americans back to work a priority again for our nation 's welfare program house speaker john a. boehner say
the bill would also restrict people enrol in other social welfare program from automatically become eligible for food stamp
in addition the legislation would allow state to require food stamp recipient to be test for drug and to stop lottery winner from get benefit
the senate farm bill also contain a restriction on lottery winner
critic of the measure say the cut would fall disproportionately on child
yes the federal government have budget problem but child do not cause them and cut anti hunger investment be the wrong way to solve them say bruce lesley president of first focus campaign for children a child advocacy group
accord to the congressional budget office nearly four million people would be remove from the food stamp program under the house bill start next year
the budget office say after that about three million a year would be cut off from the program
the budget office say that leave unchanged the number of food stamp recipient would decline by about 14 million people or 30 percent over the next 10 year as the economy improve
a census bureau report release on tuesday find that the program have keep about four million people above the poverty level and have prevent million more from sink further into poverty
the census data also show nearly 47 million people live in poverty close to the high level in two decade
historically the food stamp program have be part of the farm bill a huge piece of legislation that have routinely be pass every five year authorize financing for the nation 's farm and nutrition program
but in july house leader split the bill 's farm and nutrition section into separate measure pass the farm legislation over democrat objection
the move come after the house reject a propose farm bill that would have cut $ 20 billion from the food stamp program
conservative lawmaker help kill the bill say the program need deep cut

throughout their problem the family member sing about their past in ireland their household tradition and their everyday worry
step dance routine be intersperse throughout prompt whoop and cheer from the audience
much of the loud appreciative applause at a recent performance be no doubt from the parent of the young dancer though some of it come from at least one critic
ah why not
as the shy magee casey murray 15 have an appealing stage presence
her singing voice be gentle and pleasing her dancing control but energetic
garrett coleman portray eddie her potential beau
he ' a fierce dancer with a carefree smile
jason oremus as a crusty teacher also own a fast set of foot
paul nugent conor mcintyre and john charles mclaughlin as magee 's brother have splendid comic timing while elizabeth west and peter cormican as her parent exude warmth
that warmth be important here
the script by marianne driscoll often veer toward cliche this irish family have a penchant for alcohol and spin tall tale
but the character radiate enough genuine affection to make such moment forgivable
the mod song with lyric by ms. driscoll and eliot riskin and music by ronnie d'addario patrick mangan be credit with the dance music also aim for easy emotional target that they usually hit
mcgoldrick 's thread direct by kira simring at theater 80 end just where you would expect and right where it should finish with a final bit of footwork from the young cast member
all that stomping be over when the light go up
but the show 's simple sweetness hang around a bit longer

the man john moon a fine sam rockwell live his spartan existence in a beat up trailer in the middle of
nowhere u.s.a. it ' the kind of atmospherically desolate place where at least in fiction man and their destiny be rarely alone for long
and so it be for moon who soon have to deal with a dead woman and a stash of cash
both bring moon a world of trouble far more than he or this unpersuasive movie can bear
direct by david m. rosenthal and write by matthew f. jones from his 1996 novel a single shot have many of the fixing of a classic noir include bad woman bad man and an existential loner with no obvious exit
as with some noir hero moon do not just back into trouble he throw himself right into its pitiless embrace partly by make all the wrong move
for starter he hide the corpse and take the cash
then he start eyeball a tough look local jason isaacs one of those charmer in black leather with an iron cross tattoo on his neck
fatalism can be a beautiful thing in film noir a character 's apparent stupidity on the other hand grow old very quickly
build my gallows high baby robert mitchum tell jane greer in the indelible classic
out of the past surrender to the glorious creature who ' the beautiful instrument of his destruction
but pessimism be not moon 's problem nor be desire or destiny or overwhelming terminal despair or well anything other than underdeveloped narrative and character
mr. rosenthal put the story 's part into play well enough but once everyone and everything be in position that ' more or less where they stay as this slow story downshift to a crawl
moon remain in his trailer even when it ' clear that he should leave as everything else around him flail about
character make big entrance and exit yell and threaten in a hash of movie make southern accent

the four doctor interview and observe on screen who the film say be the only one in the united states openly perform third trimester abortion be heroic figure in the filmmaker eye but be condemn as murderer by those on the other side
it would be nice to believe that a movie like this could provoke civil and respectful dialogue about an intensely polarizing issue but let 's not kid ourselves

the film linger on detail of the tour a filthy motel or one comedian 's obsessive search for snapple at the expense of the stand up routine
and the message seem muddled when the joke include how ms. farsad 's iranian mother distrust black
be the assurance that those who experience bigotry be also bigoted a way to deflate prejudice
perhaps
after all comedy be subjective
but i do not find it convincing
nor be i impress by the occasional cheap joke lob at provincial attitude in southern and midwestern small town
mr. stewart be more insightful and amusing in his commentary for instance when he wryly say that anti muslim sentiment be not ignorance bear of hate but ignorance bear of ignorance
unlike mr. stewart and the daily show this well intentioned docu comedy as the filmmaker label it in publicity note be not very funny

the discovery of the opioid receptor would in 1978 earn the covet albert lasker award often a precursor to the nobel prize
the award go to solomon h. snyder who head the lab
neither dr. pert nor any of the other lab assistant be cite
such omission be common in the world of science the graduate student in the lab rarely get credit beyond be the first name on the paper describe the research
but dr. pert do something unusual she protest send a letter to the head of the foundation that award the prize say she have play a key role in initiate the research and follow it up and be angry and upset to be exclude
her letter cause a sensation in the field
some saw her exclusion as an example of the burden and barrier woman face in science career
in a 1979 article about dr. pert in the the washington post dr. snyder who have laud dr. pert 's contribution in his lasker acceptance speech argue that that ' the way the game be play add that today 's graduate student will be tomorrow 's lab chief and that when they have student it will be the same
the two later reconcile
in an e mail interview on wednesday dr. snyder now a professor in the solomon h. snyder department of neuroscience at johns hopkins call dr. pert one of the most creative innovative graduate student i have ever mentor
dr. pert continue her career at the national institute of mental health where she continue to do pioneering work on receptor and the peptide that correspond to them come to conclusion that steer her toward alternative medicine
she become a lead proponent of the unity of mind and body and the ability of emotion to affect health
when bill moyers in a 1993 pbs special healing and the mind ask her be you say that the mind talk to the body so to speak through these neuropeptides
she answer why be you make the mind outside of the body
she be also feature prominently in the 2004 film what the $
do we know which attempt to bridge science and spirituality
in her best know book molecules of emotion the science behind mind body medicine publish in 1997 dr. pert advocate a more holistic approach to understand health
i 've come to believe that virtually all illness if not psychosomatic in foundation have a definite psychosomatic component she write
the molecule of emotion she argue run every system in our body create a bodymind 's intelligence that be wise enough to seek wellness without a great deal of high tech medical intervention
the author deepak chopra who write the foreword to molecules of emotion call the book a landmark in our understanding of the mind body connection
dr. miles herkenham a former colleague at the national institute of mental health say that it may seem odd to an outside observer that a scientist of dr. pert 's training would go into what he call the squishy world of alternative medicine
but the common theme that underlie all of her work be her knowledge as a pharmacologist of ligand peptide and how they work through receptor he say add she follow her own passion
her work lead dr. pert to team up with her husband dr. michael ruff an immunologist to investigate another protein peptide t. they hop that it would be effective in fight h.i.v. by block the entry of the virus into cell
while the drug show promise it have not lead to a successful treatment
dr. pert publish more than 250 scientific paper on peptide
in more recent year she and dr. ruff found a company rapid pharmaceuticals that be develop peptide base drug to treat alzheimer 's cardiovascular disease and other disease by fight the inflammation that underlie many chronic medical condition
candace beebe be bear on june 26 1946 in manhattan
her father robert be a commercial artist and her mother mildred work in the court as a clerk typist
she graduate with a degree in biology from bryn mawr college and earn a doctorate in pharmacology from the johns hopkins university school of medicine
she also become interested in psychology but ultimately seek a more solid scientific basis for behavior
i want there to be a field that look for the biochemical substrate of psychology she say
that field do not really exist at the time
but i begin to search for it and it begin to exist
her first marriage to agu pert a fellow researcher end in divorce they have three child brandon evan and vanessa pert haneberg all of whom survive her
besides her sister ms. beebe and dr. ruff she be survive by a grandson
one of the friend schedule to speak at dr. pert 's memorial service plan for late october be solomon snyder
a couple of decade ago chinese restaurant be as ubiquitous as italian one
nearly every town on long island have at least one
today japanese fusion and pan asian spot have take their place
maru asian cuisine in st. james be a recent example of the trend in name at least
the restaurant open in march in the space formerly occupy by lotus east one of the island 's top chinese restaurant for 25 year
jia liu a first time restaurateur buy it from its original owner last fall and begin to offer teriyaki pad thai and shrimp bali style as special
in may he create a new menu incorporate these and other pan asian offering though a majority of the dish be still chinese
maru look much like the old lotus east
the spacious dining room feature chinese statue and painting and a ceiling hang with red chinese lantern
floor be carpet the chair cushion be red and gold silk and the tablecloth and napkin be pale pink
as in old school chinese restaurant crispy noodle arrive at the table accompany by hot mustard and duck sauce
maru also send out a complimentary salad of mixed green cucumber tomato and carrot in a ginger dress a nice touch
unfortunately maru do not live up to lotus east when it come to the food
our meal have ups and down with almost equal number of success and failure
service be pleasant but sometimes confused a language barrier may have be an issue in some case
for a splendid start to a meal order shrimp toast four triangle of crispy goodness
run a close second be the crunchy vietnamese spring roll slim cylinder fill with shred vegetable
edamame liberally sprinkle with salt be another plus
but avoid the gyoza
they contain shrimp not the usual pork and the filling be mushy with a strong fishy taste
barbecue rib be flavorful but tough
chicken lettuce wrap be tasty but be miss the crunch of water chestnut they also lack the usual accompaniment of hoisin sauce which may have spark their flavor
the best entree we sample be shrimp bali style a stir fry of seafood and vegetable baby corn pepper peapods and mushroom in a flavor pack brown sauce with thai seasoning
pad thai moist and not overly sweet be also above average
a surprise hit be flaky and moist steamed salmon with an assertive scallion and ginger sauce
however singapore chow mei fun a favorite that i have taste in every chinese restaurant that have offer it be a dud
the angel hair pasta have none of the characteristic curry flavor
in fact it have no flavor at all only heat from red pepper
speak of heat shred pork in garlic sauce request mild be the spicy version i have ever taste
slice beef with scallion be tender and tasty but mango chicken be overly sweet
dessert be even more limited here than it be at many asian restaurant
the menu list fry banana fried ice cream fried cheesecake and litchi but none be available on our visit the only choice be ice cream or pineapple chunk
the ice cream be ordinary we pass on the pineapple
driver on north country road will see the big new sign for maru asian cuisine but they will also see sign on the outside wall and on the awning that say lotus east
people answer the phone recently still say lotus east but do not be fool while maru have some good dish it be not in the same league as its predecessor

wobbling blissed out a few in tear people emerge every 12 minute or so from the remnant of a 12th century spanish chapel tuck into the cloisters museum
something have happen there up on a hill at the northern end of manhattan
it ' too soon to talk margaret cardenas say as she leave the chapel
too raw say another young woman alyssa
inside the ancient chapel be the first presentation of contemporary art ever at the cloisters the forty part motet an 11-minute immersion in a tapestry of voice each thread as vivid as the whole fabric
a sacred composition of renaissance england be render by the multimedia artist janet cardiff through 40 speaker one for each voice in the salisbury cathedral choir which perform the piece in 2000
what start as one microphone per singer be now a choir of black high fidelity speaker array in an oval eight grouping of soprano alto tenor baritone and bass
in the intimate space of the museum 's fuentidueã±a chapel the sound from invisible people as if from ghost feel like charge live sculpture
through dec. 8 it play in a loop all day
ms. cardenas 24 have stay in the chapel through four full cycle walk along the rank of speaker then sit on a bench in the center
i 'm kind of out of it i can not articulate it she say
each speaker be a different person
it ' not something you think about you feel it
in a moment she find the word
transcendent she say
ms. cardenas be visit the east coast from oregon for a wedding and come to new york this week specifically to see a monumental installation by james turrell in the rotunda of the guggenheim museum
then she hear about the forty part motet and trek uptown
this be cooler honestly than turrell ms. cardenas say
i be super fortunate to get to see both
others stumble onto the forty part motet while do a lap around the city museum circuit
no one who set foot inside the cloisters can miss the sound although they be at their most powerful within the jeweled acoustic space of the chapel they soar through the building
we have no idea it be here and then we hear it all along as we go around the exhibit say bengt ehlim who be visit the city from sweden with his wife susanne
she seem to be step out of a trance
i be so really move ms. ehlim say
the core of ms. cardiff 's installation be a motet spem in alium a latin fragment of the phrase in
no other
be my hope compose by thomas tallis sometime in the 16th century
its transformation into the forty part motet have be exhibit at moma ps1 the museum 's space in long island city queens
i 'd see it at moma and the gallery be very neutral jeff gray 33 a computer programmer and musician say outside the chapel

but there ' nothing like this kind of space the resonance of brick with wood roof
the kind of ghost quality be a lot more apparent here
everything bounce a lot more you hear a voice over here and you kind of feel it float around you
he be accompany by etta yuki who work in independent film
the sensation she guess be what the director of an orchestra would feel
and see it in a place like this put it in a spiritual context ms. yuki 36 say
sample from the familiar the sum of the ancient sound and space arrive in modern ear and eye like nothing else not like hear a church choir not like listen to music on a superb sound system
i 've sing in english church choir and i know what it ' like to be in a space with 40 people and sing something like this norman yamada 50 a composer and high baritone say
this be a different slightly unsettling experience he say acoustically dry sound be reconstitute
by close mikeing each singer you have get it very dry he say
then you put it back in this space and it take the coloring of the space
the space of course take its coloring from history
the fuentidueã±a chapel be part of a castle fortress complex in segovia during the hundred of year of war between muslims and christians in spain
ms. ehlim the swedish visitor have make the journey from her accommodation in the hectic east village to the cloisters look for the opposite of war
my sister tell me this be a lovely place to go if you want to have some peace in new york ms. ehlim say

florham park n.j. when rex ryan be hire to coach the jets in 2009 he insist on run effectively a philosophy that he capture in the catchphrase ground and pound
even as the jets develop geno smith a rookie quarterback who understandably lack polish that be no longer ryan 's mantra do i expect us to run more than pass
not really ryan say after thursday 's practice
i 'd like to be close to balance
i think that ' where we have be the first couple of game
so i think that ' pretty good
the jets who will host the buffalo bills on sunday in a meeting of a.f.c. east team with 1 1 record have attempt 74 pass and 61 rush
smith drop back 42 time in a 13 10 loss at the new england patriots on sept. 12 in a game that raise question about how committed marty mornhinweg the new offensive coordinator would be to the run
the jets back off the ground game despite rush 32 time for 129 yard smith throw three interception in the fourth quarter
mornhinweg be well know for his pas first approach
this be the most i have ever run he say and ryan appear to welcome that
the old football mentality about would i prefer to run the ball than throw it
yeah of course ryan say
but that being say the way the game be play now i also like to attack down the field
smith 's statistical line at new england and his forgettable fourth quarter raise question about his ability to lead that kind of offense so soon
he complete only 15 of 35 pass for 214 yard
the jets score their lone touchdown on bilal powell 's 3-yard run with five minute leave in the third quarter
powell carry 13 time for 48 yard
chris ivory who be expect to play a major role after he be acquire from the new orleans saint during the off season have 12 carry for 52 yard
but ivory carry only once after powell 's score
mornhinweg sound as though he be willing to stay the course
he be learn on the job just a little bit he say of smith and that ' o.k. mornhinweg the third offensive coordinator under ryan have far more experience than his predecessor brian schottenheimer and tony sparano
sparano have never hold the position before and last only one season before he be dismiss and mornhinweg be hire
mornhinweg who learn the west coast offense under bill walsh the former 49er coach build a strong resume with san francisco and then for the last 10 year with the philadelphia eagles
during mornhinweg 's time with philadelphia the eagles set single season franchise record for completion 367 in 2012 total net yard 6,386 in 2011 completion percentage 62 in 2010 point 439 in 2010 average yard per rush 5.4 in 2010 third down percentage 42.4 in 2007 and net passing yard 4,119 in 2006 among others
with that background member of the jets readily accept whatever he present them
i 've always be a fan of run the ball early so you get into a rhythm right guard willie colon say
but that ' not the way we 're build right now
we 're build to have geno get the ball in the air
ryan believe that the great issue for the jet involve execution not approach
they have a number of drop pass against the patriots
you 're leave a lot of play out there he say
if we could have catch half of those ball we drop the outcome may have be a lot different
clearly you 're an n.f.l. receiver you 're pay to catch the football and we certainly need to do it
extra points coach rex ryan open his news conference by offer condolence to tom coughlin his giants counterpart

it be totally too much say colon who make contact with an official who be attempt to restore order
woodville ala. there be at least two type of alabamian you do not want to anger
one be a wild raccoon
the other be a person who rehabilitate wild raccoon
the state conservation agency that give permit to volunteer who help injure and orphaned wildlife send out a letter this month tell 72 group and individual to stop rehabilitate certain animal
instead the animal should be leave to their fate or euthanized either with a bullet or at the hand of a veterinarian
from the state 's perspective the move would help prevent rabies and keep the food chain in balance
there be no biological reason to rehabilitate these animal say ray metzler assistant chief of wildlife for the alabama department of conservation and natural resources
people need to learn to let nature take its course
on the list be feral pig coyote bat and fox animal that do not often end up in the care of the volunteer
but at the top of the list be raccoon
raccoon have never have it easy in alabama where a hunting license and a good coon dog be cultural currency in some part of the state
hunting association here can legally keep up to 10 raccoon in a cage to train coon hound
and since the 1950 the state have offer permit for an event call coon on the log
the contest which be rare these day be design to test a coon hound 's mettle
a raccoon be tie to a log and float into a lake
owner then release their dog and see which one have the fortitude to knock the raccoon into the water
but rehabbers as the people devote to help injure wildlife call themselves love raccoon
they be as cuddly as puppy and easy to train when they be young but extraordinarily ornery once they hit adolescence which be when rehabbers generally release them back into the wild
john russ a 65-year old former marine just last week release two raccoon on his 144-acre sanctuary here
he and other rehabbers say the new restriction stem from a conflict between member of one rehabilitation group and local wildlife official
but they also believe an inherent anti raccoon bias be at play
these guy they have some issue with raccoon mr. russ say
they always have
a hunter first mentality the rehabbers say lead to the state 's suggestion that raccoon along with possum and skunk which be also on the list be euthanized or just leave to fend for themselves
baby raccoon be often orphan because tree fell to clear land leave animal homeless or new ribbon of roadway bring more car which kill mother
a ford truck be not nature take its course say april russ mr. russ 's wife who be also a rehabber
the state 's rehabbers have vow to fight the ban even if it bring trouble in a state where keep a wild animal without a permit be illegal
if somebody bring me a baby raccoon i be not go to turn it away mr. russ say
it ' a death sentence
pleas for support have be send to people for the ethical treatment of animals and to ellen degeneres and bob barker both animal right activist
two petition with at least 28,000 signature be be prepare for gov. robert bentley
word be get out to more rehabbers a tight knit group that have work for decade to develop national guideline
they share best practice like what to fee a baby squirrel how large a raccoon nesting box should be or how to make sure animal do not get too accustomed to human while they be nurse back to health
the whole world be go to see this horrific thing happen in alabama say kim baker of coast and canyon wildlife rehabilitation in malibu calif.
mr. metzler insist there be nothing nefarious in the new policy which he say be develop not out of a dislike for rehabbers or raccoon but after a year of study and consultation with federal wildlife and rabies expert
he say the goal be to standardize policy that regulate both rehabbers and people who get pay to remove nuisance wildlife like a snake in a garage or a raccoon in an attic
we be not try to put them out of business by any mean mr. metzler say add that rehabbers can still save rabbit deer and squirrel
the point be we would like for people to leave wildlife alone he say
that raccoon that ' accustom to eat out of the dog bowl it ' not go to survive in the wild
on sept. 20 1932 11 worker sit on a beam 69 floor above manhattan during the construction of rockefeller center
the photograph of this moment one of the most famous image of new york be call lunch atop a skyscraper even though a cigarette and a liquor bottle in the hand of these workman be as noticeable as any sandwich
open 81 year to the day after that photograph be take be man at lunch a documentary about the picture 's resonance as a symbol of everymen and about the mystery of who those man really be
the film 's narration by the irish actress fionnula flanagan be lovely the detail reveal of the photograph be fascinating and the commentary by historian on how the photograph relate to life during the depression and to the immigrant experience be illuminating
yet the film feel meander
not only do it offer a jumble of idea that be not follow through but it ' also structure oddly
it culminate in the revelation that two of the worker in the picture be possibly from a small irish village which seem a detour from the american grandeur and casual bravery on which the film focus
that the director sean o cualain be irish and that the film be finance partly by the irish film board may explain this emphasis
but a montage of modern construction at the world trade center site near the end seem even more off the mark and without thematic connection to what precede it
prime minister shinzo abe on thursday order the operator of japan 's crippled nuclear power plant to scrap all six reactor at the site instead of just four schedule for decommissioning and to concentrate on tackle press issue like leak of radioactive water
but mr. abe insist that radioactive water have be contain at the fukushima daiichi plant and say that he would fend off rumor regard fukushima 's safety
he instruct the plant 's operator the tokyo electric power company to decommission the no
5 and no 6 reactor which survive the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami that damage the four other reactor
mr. abe say he stand by the reassurance about tokyo 's safety that he give to the international olympic committee this month before the city be award the right to host the 2020 summer olympic games
but many japanese believe that he be gloss over problem at the plant
official have acknowledge that radiation contaminate groundwater have be seep into the ocean since soon after meltdown and explosion cripple the plant
moscow the russian government on thursday approve across the board budget cut over the next two year in the clear sign yet that official do not expect its economy the world 's eighth large to revive soon and that the kremlin be ready to try a new policy to spur growth
make the move more unusual the cut come midway through a previously approve spending plan and they reflect a shift in strategy away from reliance on consumer spending
in russia budget be approve for three year in advance rather than year by year
the finance ministry now project that revenue will be 3.5 percent low in 2014 and 7 percent low in 2015 than it predict a year ago when the government of president vladimir v. putin approve the three year spending plan
under the revised budget military salary will be freeze next year and the government will put less money into a pension fund for future retiree
it will use the money to meet current pension obligation instead
the budget turn out really tough dmitri a. medvedev the prime minister and a former president say in comment carry by russian news agency on thursday when he present the new plan
we have to work off the real situation in the economy in our country and in the world
the problem for russia 's economy run deeper than its overwhelming dependence on oil and ga revenue which account for more than half the federal budget
wage that for year rise fast than labor productivity under economic policy that make mr. putin widely popular have now price russians out of the market for many good and service globally
russia 's economy be now grow more slowly than that of the united states
in the second quarter the gross domestic product rise 1.2 percent in russia compare with 2.5 percent in the united states
official spend the summer debate how to reverse the slowing of economic growth here
in a speech in june mr. putin suggest the kremlin would try to prime the economy with government spending by dip into about $ 171 billion in reserve in sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure project like modernize the trans siberian railway
those spending plan be never carry out
since then the economic policy team have change direction economist say and the new approach become clear with the release of the plan for cut the three year budget rather than run high deficit
they want to change the model of growth in russia 's economy away from dependence on consumer spending vladimir i. tikhomirov chief economist at the otkritie brokerage house say of the new policy
the government and central bank have decide their top priority be to bring inflation down
this shift mr. tikhomirov say reflect a deep seat aversion by mr. putin to foreign borrowing of the type that make the soviet union beholden to western bank in its late year
in light of the worsen slowdown here further stimulus would require foreign borrowing
it go against normal economic policy to cut spending in the face of an economic slowdown mr. tikhomirov say
the new russian policy instead retrace a growth strategy follow successfully in the late 1990 by eastern european nation like poland which focus intensely on control inflation and borrowing cost for business
though this bring a temporary slowdown and even recession in some country business activity pick up as rate come down
the russian government predict several year of slow growth of about 3 percent down from the 4.5 percent previously forecast
but inflation the bane of post soviet russia for many year be project to drop to 4.5 to 5.5 percent next year and below 5 percent in subsequent year from around 6 percent this year
without new growth produce by low interest rate in the late part of this decade the government will struggle to meet demand for increase spending on pension for the country 's age population
in the short term as inflation be bring under control and before growth pick up mr. putin could find his political support erode
mr. tikhomirov the otkritie economist say the policy should start show result in 2016 or so before mr. putin be up for re election in 2018
the government must submit the plan to the parliament for approval by oct. 1 though major change be unlikely

washington putting down a marker before his coming trip to the united nations secretary of state john kerry say thursday that it be essential for the united nations security council to pass a resolution next week to eliminate syria 's chemical arsenal
now the test come mr. kerry say
the united nations security council must be prepare to act next week
when the united states and russia reach a framework agreement on saturday to remove or destroy syria 's chemical weapon mr. kerry emphasize that the next step be for the council to pass a bind resolution to enforce the accord
since then however important difference between russia and the united states have emerge that call into question whether the agreement will ever be carry out
american french and british official have push for a strong security council resolution which would provide a basis for impose punitive measure if president bashar al assad of syria fail to comply
the united states and france have also say that the threat of force must be maintain to ensure that mr. assad follow through
but sergey v. lavrov the russian foreign minister have continue to assert that there be no proof the assad government carry out a chemical attack near damascus on aug. 21 suggest this week that additional investigation be need before the council could take any firm action
russia have also reject the potential use of force
in the statement by mr. kerry on thursday which he read at the state department he insist that the case against the assad government be ironclad and have be buttress by the recent united nations report on the attack
despite the effort of some to suggest otherwise thanks to this week 's long await u.n. report the fact in syria only grow clear and the case only grow more compelling mr. kerry say
the secretary of state be schedule to go to new york on sunday for a week of meeting in conjunction with the convening of the united nations general assembly
we really do not have time today to pretend that anyone can have their own set of fact approach the issue of chemical weapon in syria he say
earlier on thursday mr. kerry meet with foreign minister wang yi of china seek support for a firm resolution in the security council
in public remark before a work lunch mr. kerry note that the united states and china have differ sharply over how strongly to respond to the chemical weapon attack
but he appeal to china to play a positive constructive important role in the council 's deliberation
mr. wang say that china which hold a security council veto support the framework agreement and believe that the united nations should as well
but he do not provide any clue as to how firmly the resolution should be word
vice president joseph r. biden jr. also meet with mr. wang
as the united states and russia seek to influence the security council resolution a senior member of the assad government say that a cease fire should be impose if peace talk be hold to end the conflict
neither the armed opposition nor the regime be capable of defeat the other side qadri jamil the syrian deputy prime minister say in an interview with the guardian
this zero balance of force will not change for a while
mr. kerry plan to meet next week with mr. lavrov and lakhdar brahimi the united nations envoy on the syria crisis to discuss planning for a possible peace conference
no date for a conference have be set and russia and the united states be at odds over who should attend
russia for example have insist that iran should participate
the united states have opposed include iran and say the london 11 a group of european and arab nation that support the syrian opposition should attend
even as he call for a peace conference however mr. jamil object to proposal by the united states and its allies as to how it should be organize
the united states have insist that a syrian opposition coalition lead by ahmad al jarba play a major role in negotiate a transfer of power to a transitional government from which mr. assad would be exclude
we 're feed up with this monopolistic view mr. jamil say
berlin a few week ago germany 's leave lean social democratic party throw a lavish campaign event for more than 200,000 people next to the brandenburg gate in the middle of berlin
there be bratwurst balloon and song but the party never quite take off
perhaps that ' because in this sunday 's national election the social democratic party germany 's old and proud be likely to endure yet another crushing defeat just as it do in 2009 when it be vote out of government with a meager 23 percent of the vote
when you ask lead member of the social democrats to explain why on earth they be lose so much ground at a time when global capitalism have be get such bad press they have an easy answer
it be chancellor angela merkel 's fault
the right of center chancellor they feel constantly outflank them on the left minimum wage gender quota in the workplace same sex marriage they name it she hasten to adopt it
she even order the shutdown of the country 's nuclear power plant a signature goal of the social democrats ally the green party after the 2011 fukushima disaster in japan
but blame ms. merkel be too easy
there be a long story to tell
the social democratic party which be celebrate its 150th birthday this year be once the world 's large and most influential worker party the global standard bearer for the modern european welfare state
by the end of the 20th century though it be often more about nostalgia for past accomplishment than the present and future of its constituent
but by the early part of the last decade the social democrats under the leadership of chancellor gerhard schrã¶der be once again ahead of the game
the party saw itself as a force for modernization it romanticize the future not the past
the welfare state have to be adjust if it be to survive at all and have to fit an age country with more migrant fewer natural resource and few child
our current wirtschaftswunder or business miracle of economic success amid a europe wide recession be largely a result of painful labor reform put in place by mr. schrã¶der and the social democrats begin in 2003
the reform pay off for the country as a whole but they be hard on the poor
union lambast mr. schrã¶der and thousand march in the street against him
the reform cost his party a third of its member many of whom flee to a new party the left which draw much of its strength from those disappoint with post communist life in the former east germany
that membership exodus cost the social democrats control of the government in 2005 after which they be force into a so call grand coalition with ms. merkel 's christian democrats
in response the social democrats distance themselves from mr. schrã¶der and his reform apologize profusely for their great achievement
so while ms. merkel may co opt some left wing issue as her own on the big issue of all it be the social democrats who have cede the political payoff of mr. schrã¶der 's reform low unemployment and a stable social security system to the right
the christian democrats would never dream of pick a fight with the union or face demonstrator in the street
ms. merkel recently admit as much we would not be where we be today without the courageous step take by my predecessor chancellor schrã¶der
all be not lose for the social democrats however
for month peer steinbrã¼ck the sharp tongued witty candidate of the party stumble from one gaffe to the next
he come across as arrogant technocratic and uncaring and as a centrist uncomfortable with take up the left 's banner
at the low point of his campaign he find himself reduce to tear during a public appearance with his wife after she express her support for him
but he have begin to turn thing around
in a recent tv debate mr. steinbrã¼ck manage to come across as decisive and politically brave by question ms. merkel 's one weakness her unwillingness to take a stand to run a political risk
suddenly mr. steinbrã¼ck 's technocratic arrogance look like a strength
with election day approach social democrats have long give up on the idea of win outright
what they dread now be do just well enough to be force again into a coalition with the invincible ms. merkel
yet that be increasingly the most likely outcome
it ' also what an overwhelming majority of germans want
many social democrats fear be stifle as the junior partner to a powerful chancellor
but there be no shame in be part of a grand coalition
if the party can own up to its success it can use its coalition role to build on that record
it may not lead to victory right away but one day it could
contrary to what many seem to think angela merkel will not be around forever

stanford calif. the specter of violence cause by mental illness keep raise its head
the newtown conn. school killer may have suffer from the torment voice characteristic of schizophrenia it ' possible that he kill his mother after she be spook by his strange behavior and try to institutionalize him
we now know that aaron alexis who kill 12 people at the washington navy yard on monday hear voice many observer assume that he too struggle with schizophrenia
to be clear a vast majority of people with schizophrenia a disease we popularly associate with violence never commit violent act
they be far more likely to be the victim of violence than perpetrator of it
but research show us that the risk of violence from people with schizophrenia be real significantly great than it be in the broad population and that the risk increase sharply when people have disturbing hallucination and use street drug
we also know that many people with schizophrenia hear voice only they can hear
those voice feel real speak by an external command authority
they be often mean and violent
an unsettling question be whether the violent command from these voice reflect our culture as much as they result from the disease process of the illness
in the past few year i have be work with some colleague at the schizophrenia research foundation in chennai india to compare the voice hear experience of people with schizophrenia in the united states and india
the two group of patient have much in common
neither particularly like hear voice
both report hear mean and sometimes violent command
but in our sample of 20 comparable case from each country the voice hear by patient in chennai be considerably less violent than those hear by patient in san mateo calif. describe his own voice an american matter of factly explain
usually it ' like torture people to take their eye out with a fork or cut off someone 's head and drink the blood that kind of stuff
other americans speak of war as in they want to take me to war with them or their suicide voice ask why do not you end your life
in chennai the commanding voice often instruct people to do domestic chore to cook clean eat bathe to go to the kitchen prepare food
to be sure some chennai patient report disgusting command in one case a woman hear the god hanuman insist that she drink out of a toilet bowl
but in chennai the horrible voice people report seem more focused on sex
another woman say male voice very vulgar word and raw
i would cry
these observation suggest that local culture may shape the way people with schizophrenia pay attention to the complex auditory phenomenon generate by the disorder and so shift what the voice say and how they say it
indeed that be the premise of a new patient drive movement more active in europe than in the united states which argue that if you treat unsettling voice with dignity and respect you can change them
the hearing voices movement encourage people who hear distress voice to identify them to learn about them and then to negotiate with them
it be an approach that fly in the face of much clinical practice in the united states where psychiatrist tend to assume that treat such voice as meaningful encourage those who hear them to give them more authority and to follow their command
yet while there be no judgment from the scientific jury at this point there be evidence that at least some people find that when they use the hearing voices approach their voice diminish become kinder and sometimes disappear altogether independent of any use of drug
this evidence be strengthen by a recent study in london that teach people with schizophrenia to create a computer animate avatar for their voice and to converse with it
patient choose a face for a digitally produce voice similar to the one they be hear
they then practice speak to the avatar they be encourage to challenge it and their therapist respond use the avatar 's voice in such a way that the avatar 's voice shift from persecute to support them
all of the 16 patient who receive a six week trial of that therapy find that their hallucination become less frequent less intense and less disturbing
most remarkably three patient stop hear hallucinate voice altogether even three month after the trial
one of those three patient have hear voice incessantly for the prior 16 year
the more we know about the auditory hallucination of schizophrenia the more complex voice hearing seem and the more heterogeneous the voice hear population become
not everyone will benefit from the new approach
still they offer hope for those struggle with a grim disease
meanwhile it be a sobering thought that the great violence in the voice of americans with schizophrenia may have something to do with those of us without schizophrenia
i suspect that the root of the difference may be relate to the great sense of assault that people who hear voice feel in a social world where mind be so private and for the most part spirit do not speak
we americans live in a society in which when people feel threaten they think about gun
the same cultural pattern that make it difficult to get gun violence under control may also be responsible for make these terrible auditory command that much harsh

early this year bobby jindal the governor of louisiana make headline by tell his fellow republicans that they need to stop be the stupid party
unfortunately mr. jindal fail to offer any constructive suggestion about how they may do that
and in the month that follow he himself proceed to say and do a number of thing that be shall we say not especially smart
nonetheless republicans do follow his advice
in recent month the g.o.p. seem to have transition from be the stupid party to be the crazy party
i know i be be shrill
but as it grow increasingly hard to see how in the face of republican hysteria over health reform we can avoid a government shutdown and maybe the even more frightening prospect of a debt default the time for euphemism be past
it help i think to understand just how unprecedented today 's political climate really be
divide government in itself be not unusual and be in fact more common than not
since world war ii there have be 35 congress and in only 13 of those case do the president 's party fully control the legislature
nonetheless the united states government continue to function
most of the time divide government lead to compromise sometimes to stalemate
nobody even consider the possibility that a party may try to achieve its agenda not through the constitutional process but through blackmail by threaten to bring the federal government and maybe the whole economy to its knee unless its demand be meet
true there be the government shutdown of 1995
but this be widely recognize after the fact as both an outrage and a mistake
and that confrontation come just after a sweeping republican victory in the midterm election allow the g.o.p. to make the case that it have a popular mandate to challenge what it imagine to be a crippled lame duck president
today by contrast republicans be come off an election in which they fail to retake the presidency despite a weak economy fail to retake the senate even though far more democratic than republican seat be at risk and hold the house only through a combination of gerrymandering and the vagary of districting
democrats actually win the popular ballot for the house by 1.4 million vote
this be not a party that by any conceivable standard of legitimacy have the right to make extreme demand on the president
yet at the moment it seem highly likely that the republican party will refuse to fund the government force a shutdown at the beginning of next month unless president obama dismantle the health reform that be the signature achievement of his presidency
republican leader realize that this be a bad idea but until recently their notion of preach moderation be to urge party radical not to hold america hostage over the federal budget so they could wait a few week and hold it hostage over the debt ceiling instead
now they have give up even on that delaying tactic
the late news be that john boehner the speaker of the house have abandon his effort to craft a face save climbdown on the budget which mean that we 're all set for shutdown possibly follow by debt crisis
how do we get here
some pundit insist even now that this be somehow mr. obama 's fault
why can not he sit down with mr. boehner the way ronald reagan use to sit down with tip o'neill
but o'neill do not lead a party whose base demand that he shut down the government unless reagan revoke his tax cut and o'neill do not face a caucus prepare to depose him as speaker at the first hint of compromise
no this story be all about the g.o.p. first come the southern strategy in which the republican elite cynically exploit racial backlash to promote economic goal mainly low tax for rich people and deregulation
over time this gradually morph into what we may call the crazy strategy in which the elite turn to exploit the paranoia that have always be a factor in american politics hillary kill vince foster
obama be bear in kenya
death panel to promote the same goal
but now we 're in a third stage where the elite have lose control of the frankenstein like monster it create
so now we get to witness the hilarious spectacle of karl rove in the wall street journal plead with republicans to recognize the reality that obamacare can not be defunded
why hilarious
because mr. rove and his colleague have spend decade try to ensure that the republican base live in an alternate reality define by rush limbaugh and fox news
can we say hoist with their own petard
of course the come confrontation be likely to damage america as a whole not just the republican brand
but you know this political moment of truth be go to happen sooner or later
we may as well have it now
for decade soccer official in the united states simply want some fan in their stadium
now they have them and some of those fan have bring an unexpected problem a vulgar chant in the vein of more notoriously rabid soccer fan in other country
hardly clever it be only three word an insult direct at the oppose goalkeeper but enough to give m.l.s. official fit as they hear it spill over into live television broadcast
the chant 's simplicity be what make it appealing or appalling depend on your perspective
it have be hear this season at major league soccer game in seattle sandy utah harrison n.j. kansas city kan. and columbus ohio among other place
it have be shout by thousand of fan at man 's national team game too
sport be spontaneous it ' passionate and i do not think any of us would want to remove that from the game say evan dabby senior director of supporter relation at m.l.s.
that ' what make it beautiful
that ' what make it enticing
but there be boundary around that beauty the league have decide
dabby this season have oversee a new focused initiative to get club to eradicate the chant which accord to him be neither passionate nor spontaneous
the sentiment behind the effort be not new
commissioner don garber speak out publicly against the chant last year
before that team like the portland timbers and the new england revolution among others engage in something like fan diplomacy behavioral psychology or motivational tactic or perhaps all three
their effort have reveal how a fledgling sport league try to nurture and shape an emergent fan base
it appear to be succeed partially
the league say the chant be no longer do in organized fashion at any m.l.s. stadium though it remain a delicate situation
what anyone can witness be progress dabby say
it be deploy in one specific game situation when the opposing team 's goalkeeper prepare to restart the game on a goal kick there be a crescendo of percussive noise and swell voice
when the player then put his foot through the ball the fan yell out the phrase in unison
the three word chant know as the y.s.a. chant be a more vulgar expression of you suck jerk
it have deep but unclear root date back at least a decade
its form and usage be similar to one use in south america central america and europe suggest that early m.l.s. fan who borrow heavily at first from international fan culture adopt the structure and add their own choice word
it be a way to be antagonistic in a tongue in cheek way say dave hoyt a former president of portland 's fan group timbers army
it get people 's attention
timber fan use the chant from about 2007 to 2009 when the club play in a minor league hoyt say before decide as a group that it be overuse
hoyt say it be not about censorship
we still have plenty of chant that have blue language or whatever you want to call it he say
its obscenity be the chief concern for its harsh critic
others like hoyt simply find it play out
and some particularly those expose to overseas soccer stadium may wonder what the fuss be about
anti semitic chant last season at a premier league stadium in england cause a scandal
racist chant direct at black player continue to be a scourge for many european league
set against these example the american chanting may seem harmless
but jerome de bontin a former president of the french club monaco who be hire last year as the general manager of the red bulls say residual european hooligan culture be nothing to aspire to
he say he appreciate that american fan seem interested in game rather than create a ruckus and be disappointed when he hear the chant for the first time.â i think it be absurd that it really do not belong and that if we do not take some action it would probably get bad because as more fan come to the game they would develop this false idea that it ' accept that it ' encourage de bontin say 1 2 next page
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 20 2013a previous version of this article misidentified one of the city where major league soccer fan have use a vulgar chant this season
it be kansas city kan. not kansas city mo.

although almost 25 percent of florida 's population or 3.8 million people be uninsured the state decline to expand its medicaid program to cover more low income resident despite extremely generous federal match grant to pay for such expansion
and it refuse to set up its own health care exchange leave that job to the federal government

the department claim this edict be consistent with its general policy of prevent outsider from use county property for their own purpose and protect individual privacy
but the main goal be to keep counselor away from people apt to enroll in the health exchange
ms. sebelius have award almost $ 8 million in grant to florida organization to hire and train outreach worker and another $ 8 million to community health center for the same purpose
business like cvs caremark florida blue and insurance broker be also mount campaign to inform florida resident about what the federal law provide
with the state government so adamantly obstructive the success of health care reform in florida will depend heavily on such private effort

some rare good news have offset the usual grim prediction about the planet 's dwindle natural resource
kenya one of africa 's most important country have uncover a potentially huge new water source
now come the challenge of manage it fairly and transparently
the discovery announce last week by kenya and the united nations involve five aquifer in impoverished turkana county that could mean a more secure future for the country as a whole
of kenya 's 41 million people an estimated 17 million lack access to safe drinking water and 28 million be without adequate sanitation
the new underground source estimate to hold at least 66 trillion gallon could be use for drinking irrigate crop and water livestock
the project show what can be do when responsible authorities work together
identify the aquifer be a joint effort of the kenyan government and unesco with financial support from japan a major donor of international development assistance
advanced satellite equipment and expertise from radar technologies international help provide technical breakthrough
radar technologies a natural resource exploration concern have confirm two of the five aquifer through drilling but further exploration at the other three site be need before expert can determine more precisely how much water exist and what it will take to extract it
kenya 's task be to figure out with united nations help how to protect these supply and tap them in way that ensure they last for generation
management need to be fair and open with clear limit on how much water can be extract how often and by whom
this may not be easy in a country with a history of corruption and where the president and deputy president be face trial by the international criminal court for crime against humanity stem from the 2007 presidential election
water scarcity be a huge problem globally fuel competition among state region and tribe and sometimes lead to bloodshed

in what can be see only as an act of supreme indifference house republicans pass a bill on thursday that would drastically cut federal food stamp and throw 3.8 million americans out of the program in 2014
the vote come two week after the agriculture department report that 17.6 million household do not have enough to eat at some point in 2012 because they lack the resource to put food on the table
it come two day after the census bureau report that 15 percent of americans or 46.5 million people live in poverty
these number be basically unchanged from 2011 but in a grow economy steady rate of hunger and poverty amount in effect to backsliding
cut food stamp would accelerate the slide
food stamp keep four million people out of poverty last year and keep million more from fall deeper into poverty
under the house republican bill many of these people would be impoverished
the struggle middle class be also fare poorly
though the unemployment rate drop to a low of 7.8 percent last year from a high of 9.1 percent in 2011 median household income be virtually unchanged at $ 51,017
in a healthy economy income would rise when unemployment fall
but in today 's weak economy much of the decline in the jobless rate be not due to new hiring but to a shrink work force the very definition of a feeble labor market in which employ people work for year without raise and unemployed job seeker routinely end up in new job that pay less than their previous one
even so congressional republicans have show no inclination to end the automatic budget cut that if leave in place will lead to an estimate loss of 900,000 job in the coming year keep poverty high and income stagnant
in addition there seem to be little republican appetite for renew federal unemployment benefit a lifeline for million of unemployed americans when they expire at the end of 2013
it be nothing new that poor people be stuck and those in the middle class be struggle
the poverty rate though steady last year have worsen or fail to improve in 11 of the last 12 year
the late number would have be bad but for double up
there be currently 10.1 million adult age 25 to 34 who be not in school and who live with parent or others who be not spouse of cohabitating partner
if they be on their own 43 percent of them would fall below the poverty line which last year be $ 11,945 for someone under age 65
similarly while median household income hold steady last year it be still low by 8.3 percent or $ 4,600 measure in 2012 dollar than in 2007 before the recession
and the longer the historical perspective the more dire the situation
from 2000 to 2012 median income for work age household head by someone under age 65 again in 2012 dollar fall almost $ 7,500 from nearly $ 65,000 to just under $ 57,500 a decline of 11.6 percent
against that backdrop there be no justification for savage the safety net and decimate the budget

new jersey have some of the strong pay to play law in the country aim at regulate the awarding of contract and other favor in exchange for campaign contribution
that have make little difference this year for some new jersey player who have find a backdoor way to support gov. chris christie 's campaign for re election
since 2005 a government contractor who donate more than a set and very limited amount to a state campaign the race for governor for example could lose state business as a result
the law even have an anti circumvention clause that be suppose to keep a contractor from hide donation by send money to an outside group that then bounce the money back to a new jersey politician
as nicholas confessore write in the new york times this week some new jersey donor appear to be work around those law rather easily
at least 15 contractor do business with the state have give more than $ 500,000 to the national republican governors association
the governor group in turn have pour $ 1.7 million into mr. christie 's re election effort
the association have insist it do not earmark donation even for mr. christie who will be the group 's chairman next year
a spokesman at mr. christie 's campaign say that everybody be in strict compliance with the law
maybe so
but the bounce from new jersey contractor to the governor association to new jersey deserve investigate
the citizens campaign in new jersey which lead effort to pass the state 's pay to play law be concern
as heather taylor a spokeswoman for the group have suggest at the very least the state treasurer should look into for potential circumvention by state contractor make these donation
in addition the state 's election law enforcement commission should delve into detail of what appear to be an attempt to evade the pay to play statute
mr. christie be league ahead of his democratic opponent state senator barbara buono and these dicey fund may not make much difference in a lopsided race
still new jersey 's attempt to clean up a culture of donation link to state business deserve more than a shrug from the politician and the state official charge with oversee their campaign

ross ramsey the executive editor of the texas tribune write a regular column for the tribune
texas republicans do not have the problem texas democrats have there be plenty of conservative clamor for the top spot on the ballot
but in a year when their liberal opponent be accuse them of wag a war on woman they could end up with very few woman at the top of their ticket
it be easy to see that as a talking point especially if the democratic ticket be lead by a woman but it be difficult to tell what it may mean on election day in november 2014
many political consultant will say that female candidate outdo male candidate when all other thing be equal
others like bryan eppstein of fort worth say the answer be more complex
gender matter less and ideology â not party but ideology â matter more he say
it ' not a general advantage or disadvantage
the contention that meg whitman a republican may have an advantage over jerry brown a democrat in the 2010 race for california governor prove to be wrong
kay bailey hutchison lose to rick perry in the republican primary for texas governor that same year
mr. eppstein a republican attribute the win and the loss to other factor
democrats rev up by state senator wendy davis 's sudden celebrity during and after a june debate on a contentious abortion bill see a potential advantage in top their slatewith a woman against a republican ticket where woman be scarce
in some way the political campaign on the republican side be well under way
mr. perry say in july that he would not run for another term and attorney general greg abbott quickly confirm his plan to run for that job
that open the gate and the day between then and now have be fill with political news
candidate be raise money appear at forum hug voter and kiss baby
in some way the beginning be still under way
candidate can not file for office until nov. 9 and they have until a month after that to make their intention officially know
democrats be still put together their announcement
ms. davis of fort worth say this week that she would announce her plan oct. 3 it would surprise many democrats to hear anything other than the start of her run for governor
fuzzy as that may seem it be the clear peek into the democratic playbook
others like state senator leticia van de putte of san antonio be consider statewide run in 2014 but none have say anything official yet
some announcement have be in the negative mayor juliã¡n castro of san antonio after a political cotillion at the democratic national convention last year seem all dress up for a statewide race
but he ' not run tell reporter and others that he still have thing to do as mayor and that he do not think this be the right year for him
on the republican side there be woman in both of the top race at this speculative point of the game but neither be expect to slow the juggernaut john cornyn and mr. abbott
mr. cornyn the state 's senior united states senator do not have any well know opponent yet in his race for re election
the most serious threat to mr. abbott in the race for governor be the underfinanced tom pauken a former state republican party chairman
if linda vega and miriam martinez be bona fide contender in those two race they have yet to reveal themselves
the race for lieutenant governor and attorney general be emptyon the democratic side and stag party on the republican side
debra medina be interested in the race for comptroller if she can pull together the resource to be competitive
the only other nonjudicial statewide race with female republican candidate be for the texas railroad commission and no front runner have emerge from a field that so far include seven republican
because the democratic candidate have not line up it ' impossible to know right now whether they will have a similar male imbalance
any advantage attributable to gender may be too small anyhow
the best performance by a statewide democrat since 1994 be 49 percent and most result fall far short of that
the election will be define by the issue the top candidate choose to talk about and gender could easily change the tenor of that debate

the american official say mr. obama have congratulate mr. rouhani on his election and characterize the vote as an opportunity for change
but on sanction the official say the iranians be infer relief from the president 's more general pledge to resolve issue and move forward

have promise as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemy he send a letter early in his first term to the country 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei propose a new diplomatic chapter

rins be create when people use biofuels
so the transaction of interest be not between the oil industry and the e.p.a. but between different player in the oil supply chain
astute reader will have notice that most of the program 's critic cite in the article have tie to the oil industry
fundamentally the renewable fuel standard be about use less oil and shift to clean alternative
those goal remain
yes the e.p.a. and other regulator should improve transparency in the rin program
but we should not allow the oil industry to stand in the way of our transition to clean fuel

the israeli people once elect a prime minister yitzhak rabin who be willing to pursue a peace agreement that recognize the authentic aspiration of both people and who go a long way toward achieve it before he be assassinate
there be every reason to believe that israelis would elect such a person again if the right leader come along and there be every reason to believe that such a leader could complete the work initiate by mr. rabin
on the palestinian side there be already a leader who have show a willingness to pursue a peace agreement
mahmoud abbas be well aware that the palestinian people need to focus their national aspiration not on the negation of israeli goal but on create the preparatory structure for a palestinian state
and he have talk openly about the palestinians self destructive approach to the conflict
i sincerely believe that mr. abbas remain ready to pursue peace if he can find an israeli leader willing to engage in permanent status negotiation
peacemaking require courageous leadership
and when such leadership be in power a peace agreement and the two state solution on which it can only be base be anything but an illusion

first it do not apply to the syria case since president obama 's purpose be to punish president bashar al assad for an attack that have already happen rather than protect victim of continue chemical warfare
second the protect doctrine would have us abandon the rule of law
whatever its shortcoming the united nations be an expression of the international community the ultimate source of international law
to accord to the united states or to any nation the right to determine when to use force strike me as a dangerous proposition
we need to strengthen the united nations not weaken it further
third professor ignatieff 's argument rest on the notion of american exceptionalism a belief that we americans know better than anyone else how and when to attack unilaterally
who have give the united states the right to police the world
lastly syria be horrible but so be many other global spot past and present
how can a responsibility to protect principle be implement on a consistent basis

the biology chemistry and physic of the earth be imperfectly understand
it be not possible to predict precisely what some human choice may lead to or whether some future environmental change may be beyond human control
it be clear however that every additional billion people constrain further the choice available for life on earth human and otherwise

we 're alter the climate of the planet by pump billion of ton of fossil fuel emission into the air each year
the real world be already overcrowded as thousand of plant and animal specie face the threat of extinction

no commerce be possible without clean air clean water fertile topsoil a chemically stable atmosphere raw material for food energy and medicine and the natural processing of waste by the million of specie inhabit our soil water and air

in 2009 debra medina begin an underdog bid for governor of texas deliver one fiery speech after another to any republican club or tea party group that would let her make the case for a platform focus on state sovereignty gun right and eliminate the property tax
for nearly a year until her appearance in a televise debate draw national attention and energize her fund raising the campaign sustain itself on a shoestring budget
four year after emerge as a tea party darling in texas ms. medina be eye the open race to succeed comptroller susan combs
but as she weigh another run she know that donation from grass root supporter can take a candidate only so far in texas
i 'm hesitant to go out to these meeting and say i 'm run because i be not go to run underfunded say ms. medina who predict that grass root supporter could provide 30 percent of what she need for a campaign
i think the other 70 percent be go to have to come from high wealth individual who fund campaign in texas ms. medina say

there it ' not come
her comment underscore the huge role that wealthy donor play in texas election where there be no limit on how much an individual can donate to a candidate for a state office
with the majority of voter spread among several large medium market run a statewide campaign can be prohibitively expensive
i think that debra medina be probably right that it ' very difficult to run a grass root fund statewide campaign for that reason say andrew wheat research director for austin base texans for public justice which study campaign financing
more than half of most statewide official campaign account stem from contribution of $ 10,000 or more he say
ms. medina 's campaign for governor come on the heel of the birth of the tea party movement
though gov. rick perry who ultimately win re election quickly embrace many of the movement 's view of limited government some voter believe it conflict with his record and they turn to ms. medina in the republican primary accord to mark p. jones chairman of political science at rice university in houston
there ' a certain level of support she have out there mr. jones say
there be people who remember her and identify with that wing of the party
rice university be a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune
in july ms. medina report have $ 55,000 in her campaign account
two republicans already run for comptroller state senator glenn hegar of katy and state representative harvey hilderbran of kerrville report war chest of $ 1.8 million and $ 1 million
the comptroller serve as the state 's chief financial officer oversee tax collection and estimate the amount of revenue the legislature can employ to create its next two year budget
texas comptroller have also use the position to encourage public debate on various economic issue
ms. medina say the office be uniquely suited to her interest in influence the state 's approach to finance government over the long term
my driver be not be in elect office my driver be change policy ms. medina say
actually drive policy where our so call conservative leader have tell us they 're take it
that mix of bluntness and ideological purity be evident to voter during ms. medina 's unsuccessful bid for governor
whereas many republican candidate have nothing but praise for texas conceal carry permit system ms. medina deride it as government interference
she continue to say that texas lawmaker defy the state 's conservative image by spend liberally and institute regulation that unnecessarily distort market
i think that debra feel like a lot of conservative who back perry be not real conservative say luke macias a republican consultant whose client include several texas house member with strong tie to the tea party

i have not see her build coalition since then
her campaign for governor find fast momentum after a january 2010 televise debate in which she be widely view as defend her view and question her opponent better than mr. perry or kay bailey hutchison then a united states senator
ms. medina quickly draw more than $ 400,000 in donation from thousand of new supporter
it be more than she have raise in the previous year but a far cry from the million be spend by mr. perry and ms. hutchison at the time
yet ms. medina 's standing in the race continue rise until feb. 11 when the conservative radio host glenn beck ask her whether she agree with those who believe the government be involve in the sept. 11 2001 terrorist attack
i think some very good question have be raise in that regard ms. medina tell him add that she do not have a position on the issue
her opponent immediately vilify her and her campaign never recover
ms. medina say she never mean to suggest that she believe the government be involve in the attack only that people have the right to question their government
after finish third in the primary with 19 percent of the vote ms. medina start we texans a nonprofit that advocate many of the same position of her campaign include replace the property tax in texas with a tax on consumption
the group 's work have help ms. medina maintain a presence in the liberty movement a libertarian branch of conservatism that overlap somewhat with the tea party and be closely identify with ron paul the former texas congressman and two time republican presidential candidate whom ms. medina count as a mentor and ally
no matter how much she raise ms. medina be almost certain to be outspent throughout the republican primary mr. jones say
absent to have a credible statewide medium campaign it ' difficult to see her beat either hegar or hilderbran because they 're go to get a ton of money dump in their lap if they 're run against debra medina mr. jones say
the last thing the republican establishment want be debra medina as state comptroller

in texas where oil lubricate the economy the same way it do pickup truck energy consumption be no exception to the state 's everything be big reputation
the nation 's lead energy producer also use more energy by far than any other state
as the state 's population keep surge demand be expect to grow prompt leader to think about how it will meet its long term need
now a diverse coalition which include renewable energy advocate city official banker and others be race to institute a plan to increase energy and water efficiency upgrade that supporter say could help texas improve its conservation record and become a model for other state
we 're such a big energy user say kip averitt a former republican state senator who be part of the effort
that mean our opportunity to be efficient be huge as well
supporter acknowledge the challenge of avoid pitfall that have trip up similar effort elsewhere
the approach know as property assessed clean energy or pace address the big barrier to efficiency investment initial cost that can take year to recoup
a law allow city and county to set up program pass this year with overwhelming support in the legislature
pace allow the owner of commercial and industrial property to use a property tax lien to finance energy efficiency upgrade like solar panel and water recycling system
pace program bill an owner through the lien and forward payment to a private lender
under a smooth run program property owner pay less than what they save on their energy bill
if a property be sell the new owner would inherit the debt a rule mean to further reduce the risk of investment
tony bennett the president of the texas association of manufacturers say that after scrutinize pace his group be back the plan
we do not like subsidy he say
we do not like pick winner and loser
but pace be different he say and it would spur investment that could help his group 's 450 business cut cost
thirty other state allow similar financing plan though most apply only to energy unlike in texas
most of the state have stumble largely because of the objection of mortgage regulator who fear that pace lien would take precedence over mortgage if a homeowner default
and in california one of a few state that have have investment under pace observer say a patchwork of rule across city have discourage investor from finance project statewide
we have some baggage to overcome say charlene heydinger a lawyer lead the texas coalition call keep pace in texas
but she and her colleague say they benefit from their state 's late entry to the movement and ability to learn from others stumble
the coalition be devise what it call pace in a box a model it hop many of texas 254 county and more than 1,200 city will adopt encourage consistency in a state that value local power
it plan to unveil the program by the end of the year and it be raise money to travel and make pitch to local government
many pace supporter would prefer the program to apply to home upgrade as well
but by focus solely on commercial and industrial property advocate have garner support from banker
in a state where industry guzzle more than half of the energy use and make up close to 20 percent of all the industrial consumption in the united states the narrow focus could have an impact on energy demand
the scale here be so much big say doug lewin the executive director of the south central partnership for energy efficiency as a resource base in austin
i think texas could be a leader in energy efficiency
baghdad as a former interpreter for the american military and as a gay man hassan say he be a focus of frequent discrimination by his fellow iraqis
that be why hassan who ask to be identify only by his middle name because he fear for his safety do not see any future in his own country where he be shun for his sexuality and view as a traitor
his last and best hope he say be a visa to the united states
but that chance be now fade for hassan and many others who work for the american military
as they face increase violence here they find themselves trap in a glacially pace visa program set up for iraqis that will expire at the end of the month unless new legislation be enact to save it
the united states be my last hope for salvation say hassan whose case be be assist by a new york base organization the iraqi refugee assistance project at the urban justice center
it ' a place where i can be who i be where people will accept me for who i be
that many iraqis who work with the american military be still in the pipeline for special visa to emigrate to the united states the state department will not say how many but activist estimate it be in the low thousand remain an unresolved legacy of the american war
it be also a reflection of the perilous state of the country nearly two year after the departure of american troop the rise violence which include the remobilization of militia that once target iraqis who help the united states have raise new fear and lead more former interpreter to apply for the program just as it be set to expire
becca heller the director of the refugee assistance group say she be hopeful that legislation would eventually be enact to preserve the program
but she be worry that if the program go dark for even a few month current applicant may have to start the onerous process again under a new law
senator jeanne shaheen a new hampshire democrat who be back new legislation to save the program say we have a responsibility as americans to provide assistance to those people who have be helpful who risk their life to help our country
and i think we need to make sure we fulfill that obligation
a group of representative and senator in washington include some lawmaker who be themselves iraq veteran be hurry to save the program which be enact in 2007 and have be hamper all along by long delay because of security check
the original legislation earmark 25,000 visa over five year and over that time roughly 8,000 have be issue
so far this year the state department have issue just 454 special immigrant visa for iraqis
lawmaker say there be little actual opposition in congress but the issue have be catch in a legislative logjam and have be give little attention by many politician who would prefer to forget about the iraq war
as the deadline approach option be run out
attempt at pass immigration and defense bill that include provision for the visa program fail and now lawmaker hope to include it in a continue resolution that would keep the government run from october through the end of december
representative adam kinzinger a republican from illinois who serve two tour in iraq before enter politics be among the lawmaker try to save the visa program
as a pilot mr. kinzinger do not work much with iraqi interpreter
but he be move to action after read a book by dakota meyer a marine who earn the medal of honor for bravery in afghanistan
mr. meyer speak out about his interpreter 's difficulty in secure a visa to the united states despite his have be with mr. meyer at the battle for which he be award the medal
look mr. kinzinger say in an interview we 're a big country
we 're a country with plenty of room
and when you have people willing to fight alongside of us and put them and their family 's life in danger then we ought to repay them
about a year ago hassan give his passport to the american embassy in baghdad and believe it would be return within a few month with a visa
his last communication with the state department be an automate reply to an e mail tell him that his case be in administrative processing and warn him that the program may expire at the end of september
he be live with a sister in northern iraq where it be safe but be still without his passport
i can not get out of iraq at all he say
former interpreter not only worry about their safety but say their employment prospect in iraq be bleak because of discrimination against anyone who aid the american war effort
some see a visa as a ticket for a better life for their child
i 'm try to give my son the opportunity to be an astronaut if he want to be say yousif al timimi another former interpreter catch in the visa backlog
if he ' in iraq these option be not available
if he go to the state and fail to be something important it be his fault
my job as a father be to make these option available to him
on a recent afternoon another iraqi man in a similar predicament and who also ask his name not be publish because of safety concern unzip a black briefcase and pull out a laptop and a thick file folder contain his case document
where should we begin he say
he display letter of recommendation from military officer who be his superior
he wave another letter this one document the threat he say he have receive over the year from a shiite militia

when the mets move into citi field five year ago they be also as it turn out settle into fourth place in the national league east and make themselves comfortable
if their season end friday they would finish in that very undistinguished spot for the fifth straight season
it would be a franchise record dubious as it may seem for never in their uphill history have they end up stay in the same place for so long
even in the 1960 when the mets make a name for themselves as one of the bad team in baseball history they finish 10th and last only in their first four year of existence
in the fifth year 1966 they finish next to last in ninth
in baseball 's current division format fourth be the new ninth a home for team that be usually overmatched and not go anywhere in particular
that certainly describe the current mets who have now be in fourth place long enough to buy a new recliner hang up some picture and get to know the neighbor hello miami marlins
thing could still change this season although the odds be that they will not
after thursday afternoon 's loss to the san francisco giants the mets be 68 84 three game behind the phillies whom they will play in philadelphia this weekend
if they can somehow sweep the phillies then an escape route from fourth place would actually present itself in the final week of game
that in turn may liven up what have be another dreary september for mets fan with key player injure or trade with youngster up from the minor hop to impress but maybe not quite ready
for the mets september have become the month that will never end and when it actually do they be what do you know in fourth place again
they land there in 2009 with a 70 92 record that follow on the heel of two straight september collapse that cost them spot in the postseason
in the three season that follow the mets record get a little bit better and then a little bad 79 83 then 77 85 and then 74 88 but fourth place continue to beckon as it do again
and finish next to last in 2013 would conform with the general direction of their history
in their 51 previous season the mets have finish first just five time and dead last whether it be 5th 6th 7th or 10th place 13 time
next to last
thirteen time as well and count
in other word the mets have finish in the basement or right next to it for more than half of their existence
so how much would it matter if the mets could at least sneak into third place by the end of september
would it make a season fill with the usual assortment of disappointment any brighter
manager terry collins say beat out the phillies would be a great accomplishment with all the thing we have go through
his player do not disagree although it be clear that the constant fourth place finish be not the foremost thing on their mind
and what about the fan
on a recent chilly weeknight pat o'donnell 66 and his wife eleanor sit in the upper deck of citi field lean on a railing eye each pitch as they watch the mets lose
he wear his ron darling jersey
she wear a daniel murphy t shirt
what about it
they be ask
would third place feel liberating
do finish fourth again bother them
they actually have a chance earlier in the season to finish second
o'donnell exclaim
he then list off all that go wrong this year and add ah but it be not to be
he say he hop the mets catch the phillies and finish third if only because the phillies have the bad fan in the world when they come here
they get in fight he say
they 're very obnoxious
they talk down to our fan
out in the concourse kevin kuffner 34 and his girlfriend ariana smith have step out to take a break from the game
ask about the mets be stick for what seem like forever in fourth place kuffner have a three world response i do not care
i hope they spend some money in the off season i honestly hope kuffner add sit on a bench his head down his hand clasped
it ' a new york market you want to see them spend money
ask whom he would want the mets to sign kuffner say i just want to see that they 're
he say before pause
i do not want them to be cheap
you know
out on long island ed kranepool a met for 18 season 1962 79 include the championship year of 1969 say he would not consider a late dash to third place this season as any sign of progress
it be more complicated than that say kranepool who be usually invite back by the mets a dozen or more time a season to entertain fan and tell story about the old day
to kranepool the issue be how well the young player like travis d'arnaud wilmer flores zack wheeler and juan lagares be develop
it be a point of view echo by one of kranepool 's old mets teammate ron swoboda who continue to follow the mets from his home in new orleans
every day he watch highlight and scan the box score check the same young player kranepool be monitor
he too do not care where the mets finish this season
that ' irrelevant to me
he say his voice rise
would it make any difference if they be second
it would not make any difference to me
the number that matter be be you in the playoff
i 'm 69 year old he say calm down
i want to see them good again
he let out a long nervous laugh
i do not want to run out of time
for the moment time be only run out on this season one that may very well end with the mets back where everybody know where to find them in fourth place wait for better dig

as the favorite to succeed ben s. bernanke to lead the federal reserve janet l. yellen face no shortage of hurdle
the first would be to win confirmation from the senate an obstacle that doom the previous front runner for the job lawrence h. summers
while ms. yellen face much less potential opposition than mr. summers do the white house be not take senate approval for grant
even as the administration inform legislator on capitol hill on thursday that ms. yellen probably would be president obama 's nominee one official say the point of the call be not so much to gauge support but to tell democratic senator they should defend ms. yellen if she come under attack before a formal nomination
the second even big challenge would be to manage the central bank 's retreat from its unprecedented effort to stimulate the economy even as the nation 's job market remain frustratingly weak more than four year after the great recession
with the collapse of mr. summers 's candidacy white house official begin call senate democrats about the fed choice a senior congressional aide say the only name they mention be ms. yellen 's
since she have become the focus of public discussion the president 's staff be worry that she could become a target for criticism just as mr. summers be before the white house actually nominate her and can defend her
jeff merkley an oregon democrat who serve on the senate banking committee saidâ in an interviewâ thursdayâ that the white house have accelerate the vetting process for ms.â yellen
certainly my impression be the white house be take a very serious and fast track examination of her as a potential nominee mr. merkley say
while ms. yellen enjoy strong support from senate democrats a third of the caucus take the unusual step of sign a letter urge the president to nominate her even before the white house indicate it be lean toward mr. summers senate republicans will be more difficult to persuade
some like senator richard c. shelby of alabama an influential member of the banking committee have express reservation about her leadership in the past
mr. shelby vote against confirm her as vice chairwoman of the fed in 2010
despite the opposition ms. yellen if nominate be expect to win senate confirmation and assume the leadership of the fed early next year
mr. bernanke hand his successor a gift this week when the central bank surprise wall street and many economist by not ease the stimulus effort
on wednesday mr. bernanke walk back his earlier suggestion that the fed 's huge bond buy effort would cease when the unemployment rate fall to 7 percent instead leave the door open for that form of stimulus to continue well into 2014 and perhaps beyond even if that jobless threshold be breach
that flexibility be something that ms. yellen may well take advantage of
as the most prominent member of the fed 's dovish flank other than mr. bernanke himself ms. yellen have focus more on the dismal state of the labor market and the pressure face poor and middle class family than on the potential threat of financial instability and inflation down the road
in a major speech in february ms. yellen highlight not only the elevate unemployment rate but also long term joblessness the high poverty rate sluggish wage growth labor force dropout and homelessness as major reason for the fed to continue the stimulus
the effect of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have be harsh on some of the most vulnerable americans ms. yellen say
while the unemployment rate have fall steadily hit a five year low of 7.3 percent in august much of that improvement have come from worker drop out of the labor force rather than vigorous job creation
the monthly pace of new job have slow fall from well over 200,000 new job be add each month at the end of 2012 to 169,000 in august 2013
a more telling indicator of the continue weakness of the economy analyst say be the proportion of americans who be part of the labor force which in august hit 63.2 percent a 35-year low
while some of that decline be because of structural factor like the retirement of baby boomer and the continue shift from industrial job the trend have accelerate significantly since 2007 prompt many economist to conclude it be primarily a cyclical phenomenon that can be cure only by fast economic growth
mr. bernanke in fact highlight the fall participation rate in a news conference after the fed 's decision on wednesday 1

for year public and private school across the country have grapple with question about the value of standardized admission exam
the city 's education department respond to concern that too many child be be coach for the test to enter gifted and talented program modify its own exam this year which backfire when even more student qualify for the program
the rise of the test preparation industry with guidebook tutoring session and sample question aplenty have raise question about whether standardized test accurately measure a child 's ability
but a viable alternative have prove to be elusive give the desire for a way to measure student against a single yardstick
the educational records bureau the nonprofit organization after which the test be name and which administer the exam for private school admission defend the test on thursday
we feel have a uniform assessment be in the best interest of school parent and child say elizabeth mangas a vice president of the organization
we look forward to work with the school go forward
ms. mangas say that in recent survey of private school in new york city 80 percent report that they find the e.r.b. to be useful
the exam 's maker also argue that the grow use of test preparation program be not skew the result point to data show that average score have remain roughly the same over time

at many admission office test score be consider alongside interview with prospective family and student recommendation from preschool and observation of student in group setting
the association be work with expert to develop a new assessment by february
dr. hayot say it be too early to say what the assessment would look like but she say the group be consider way of measure noncognitive skill like resilience and attention span
she also say the group may consider provide write evaluation of student rather than a score
george p. davison head of grace church school say he hop a new assessment would emphasize the ability to identify number and letter and test a student 's fine motor skill
if a 4-year old can not recognize their name that tell you something useful he say
you 're not go to hire a $ 2,000 tutor to teach them their name
find an adequate substitute could prove challenging
for all the criticism of the test it provide a valuable tool for school have to wade through hundred or thousand of applicant and have a single test use by virtually every school sat style keep young student from endure a battery of them
victoria goldman the author of a guide to elite school in new york say it be important to have a way to independently evaluate student in what can otherwise be a highly subjective process
you be make a decision with these family for 13 year in some case she say
that ' like a marriage
it ' really important to know what you 're deal with
the test preparation industry which have blossom in new york greet the decision tepidly predict that parent would soon be search for way to train their child for the new exam however different they may be
any uncertainty that you place in the process create an absolute boom in test prep say suzanne rheault chief executive of aristotle circle one of the city 's more popular coaching program
people prep
they try to get information
they do not want their kid to be guinea pig
but several private school leader rejoice on thursday
i do not think i would see it in my lifetime say lydia spinelli director of the brick church school an upper east side school for child age 3 through 6 many of whom take the e.r.b. to get into private elementary school
for too long it ' be a cloud over our practice
perhaps no group will be more relieved than parent who must now pay more than $ 500 just to take the exam even before shell out money for practice book and tutor
anne yoakam ellsworth 43 a resident of the upper east side who write a blog about parenting and politics recall try to get her daughter rosemary now 9 into a private school that prohibit practice course or exam

a sense of divine justice seize us whenever two of the world 's pretty people find each other
this be true when taylor meet burton when brad meet angelina when paris meet helen or even when narcissus meet his reflection
we just can not help sigh over the glory of separate soul wrap in the luxury of share beauty
then there ' that other part of us that think both fearfully and hopefully it can not last
such thought be inevitably stir by david leveaux 's lopsided production of romeo and juliet which open on thursday night at the richard rodgers theater with the equally exquisite look orlando bloom and condola rashad in the title role
when these doom lover first set eye on each other it ' so obvious that they 're a match set and that they know it that the whole world seem to stand still in deference
though the kiss they subsequently share be long and deep it do not feel like the product of teenage lust
the chemistry be less erotic than aesthetic
this do not mean that the connection be not real and it ' hard not to feel protective of porcelain figurine that be destine to fall and shatter
that one of them be white and the other black may underscore the division between their family yet it register as irrelevant when they 're together
as a director mr. leveaux have always believe in the power of loveliness
this be the man who give us a fiddler on the roof 2004 that look as if it have be style for a russian vogue shoot
with romeo and juliet his trust in appearance be not entirely misplaced
mr. bloom in a first rate broadway debut and the gifted ms. rashad exude a too fine for this world purity that make their character love feel sacred
it seem right that they should speak in some of shakespeare 's most gossamer spun poetry which they do with beguiling effortlessness
yet while the production feature stunning column of flame as part of its eclectic mise en scã¨ne it never acquire the fiery all consume urgency that romeo and juliet should deliver
cut to a fast 2 hour and 20 minute this version may well leave you glow and misty eye at the conclusion of its first half which end shortly after a genuinely luminous balcony scene
but the tragic event that follow pas in such an anticlimactic blur that when our hero and heroine finally off themselves it ' hard to feel bereft
feature an era straddle set by jesse poleshuck which suggest a contemporary italian city long past its renaissance glory day the show have a certain elegant sparseness
yet it also feel overstuffed visually aurally and conceptually
a giant ominous bell be periodically raise and lower ready to toll for you know who
a well behave white dove appear for the prologue speak by brent carver who play friar laurence
and a frescoed wall its botticelli esque figure overwrite with graffiti slide in and out of view
the writing on that wall bring to mind romeo + juliet the hit 1996 movie by baz luhrmann which star a young leonardo dicaprio and claire danes and be set in a trendy beach town
and i suspect that mr. leveaux be hop to capture some of the youth appeal of that film along with that of franco zeffirelli 's countercultural screen version of 1968
david van tieghem 's background music cheekily quote the opening note of the earlier film 's theme song
hence we have romeo arrive leader of the pack style on a motorcycle his jean fashionably tear at the knee
fabio toblini do the costume
as a star entrance it ' both cumbersome and embarrassing though i guess it ' mean to establish the character 's bad boy credential
in contrast juliet be first glimpse giggle her way through a pillow fight make us think of her as still very much a little girl
i have develop a lot of respect for juliet 's perceptiveness in recent year especially after see lauren ambrose 's smart and spirited interpretation for shakespeare in the park in 2007

washington only two week after washington and the nation be debate a unilateral military strike on syria that be also intend as a forceful warning to iran about its nuclear program president obama find himself at the opening stage of two unexpected diplomatic initiative with america 's big adversary in the middle east each fraught with opportunity and danger
without much warning diplomacy be suddenly alive again after a decade of debilitating war in the region
after year of increase tension with iran there be talk of find a way for it to maintain a face saving capacity to produce a very limited amount of nuclear fuel while allay fear in the united states and israel that it could race for a bomb
syria give little room for maneuver suddenly face imminent deadline to account for and surrender its chemical weapon stockpile or risk lose the support of its last ally russia
for mr. obama it be a shift of fortune that one senior american diplomat describe this week as head spinning
in their more honest moment white house official concede they get here the messy way possible with a mix of luck in the case of syria year of sanction on iran and then some unpredicted chess move execute by three player mr. obama deeply distrust president bashar al assad of syria president vladimir v. putin of russia and iran 's erratic mullah
but the official say these be the long delay fruit of the administration 's selective use of coercion in a part of the world where that be understand
the common thread be that you do not achieve diplomatic progress in the middle east without significant pressure benjamin j. rhodes a deputy national security adviser say thursday
in syria it be the serious threat of a military strike in iran it be a sanction regime build up over five year
skeptic and there be plenty in the national security council the pentagon america 's intelligence agency and congress be not so optimistic
they think mr. obama run the risk of be drag into long negotiation and constant game of hide and seek that ultimately will result in little change in the status quo
they argue that the president 's hesitance to pull the trigger on tomahawk strike on syria nearly two week ago and the public and congressional rebellion at the idea of even limit military strike be unmistakable signal to the syrian and iranian elite that if diplomacy fail the chance of military action order by the american president be slight
these two situation be deeply intertwine say dennis b. ross who serve as mr. obama 's lead adviser on iran for the first three year of his presidency and who argue for attack syria after the aug. 21 ga attack that kill more than a thousand civilian
if the syrians be force to give up their weapon it will make a difference to the iranian calculation and would raise the prospect of some deal with tehran
if the syrians can drag this out and give up just a little that will send a very different message to the supreme leader he say
hover over it all be a third negotiation secretary of state john kerry 's effort to jump start talk between israel and the palestinians a political minefield that mr. obama and mr. kerry 's predecessor hillary rodham clinton for the most part avoid
all these possibility could evaporate quickly just ask the state department diplomat who in the last year of the bush administration think they be on the way to keep north korea from add to its nuclear arsenal or the clinton administration official who think they be on the verge of a middle east peace deal
mr. obama will most likely know whether the syrian accord stand a chance of success long before he know whether the sudden iranian charm offensive be real or a mirage
the syrians now face a series of deadline
the first come this weekend when they must issue a declaration of their chemical stock that pass the laugh test as gary samore mr. obama 's former top adviser on unconventional weapon put it earlier in the week 1 2 next page
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 21 2013a news analysis article on friday about the opportunity and danger present by two unexpected diplomatic initiative with the united states big middle east adversary syria and iran misidentified in some edition the type of weapon stock about which syria must soon issue a declaration

they apply the same standard for mr. sicari 's stand up performance
in the course of his routine sicari have demean certain people base on national origin and religion and have reveal his political leaning accord to the court 's opinion
the court can not ignore the distinct possibility that a person who have hear a routine found on humor disparage certain ethnic group and religion will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appear can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceeding
mr. sicari 's lawyer e. drew britcher say his client never crack wise on the bench and never let on that he moonlight as a comic
in his comedy routine mr. britcher add mr. sicari refrain from joke about the legal profession and never divulge his judicial job
a lawyer for the state attorney general 's office kim d. ringler argue against mr. sicari 's be allow to hold both job say municipal judge represent the most frequent contact that the public have with the justice system

after a 10-year wait emirates team new zealand and its skipper dean barker have to wait at least one more day as they attempt to win back the america 's cup
their nautically minded nation be again poise to party on thursday with a rowdy crowd gather in front of the big screen at america 's cup park and a big crowd gather in faraway auckland to watch in shed 10 on the city 's waterfront
team new zealand still need one more victory to secure the 34th america 's cup but a decade 's worth of pent up angst and expectation remain unreleased
thursday deliver a one two punch to the kiwis
punch 1 come from the defender oracle team usa which be poise and deeply impressive from the start of the first race despite face match point win by 31 second
punch 2 be deliver by the wind limit that have turn this new age cup into an all too familiar waiting game and force the second race to be delay and ultimately call off even though both ac72s have already enter the start box
it be the third straight day with at least one race postpone
the kiwis who lose the cup in auckland in 2003 lead this series 8 2
conspiracy theorist who tend to thrive in this high stake and low disclosure microcosm may be tempt to see the delay as a way of prolong the inevitable and the merchandise sale after this regatta 's disappointing preliminary phase which begin in july with an uncompetitive challenger series and have only now pick up the pace
but the regatta director iain murray have simply be respond to the weather data and directive deliver to his computer on the committee boat
the current wind limit be establish in may for safety reason after the death of the british sailor andrew simpson in a training accident in san francisco bay and there be no agreement from the team on change
on monday oracle propose to team new zealand that the wind limit to start a race be raise to 24 knot from 23 and that the fix wind speed limit in effect after the start should be remove
but team new zealand which would have have to agree to take the proposal any further decline say the regatta be already well under way
we want to race that ' why we 're here say james spithill the oracle skipper and helmsman with his kiwi counterpart barker sit next to him at a news conference
i think if you look at the level of these two team now we be way above where we be when iain make those recommendation spithill say of murray
we have two of the world 's best team in sail out there and we have get a beautiful breeze like this in the afternoon and we have to come ashore
you sort of ask yourself what we 're do out here
spithill say

but it take two team to agree and if these guy do not want to do it then we will just keep bump into this problem each day
there have be considerable friction between team new zealand and oracle team usa which be be run by russell coutts the former team new zealand star who defect to the swiss syndicate alinghi for the 2003 cup and end up wrest it away from his onetime protege barker and the kiwis
coutts 's once adore compatriot have not forget
nor have oracle 's sailor forget that team new zealand 's managing director grant dalton be particularly vocal when oracle be accuse of cheat in preliminary race in small boat
oracle end up be hit with a two race penalty which mean that although it have win four race in this series it be get scoreboard credit for only two
we be shock with the decision spithill sad
there ' no question about it but what can i do about it
absolutely nothing and the team can not do anything about it
despite the back story the wind limit sniping be a public shift in tone for this series
barker say oracle actually argue for even low wind limit in may before agree to the 23-knot ceiling
barker say team new zealand be in favor of 25 knot during the may discussion but have now prepare and update its boat for the new limit
it just seem a little bit strange that halfway through a series you feel you need to change a wind limit that have be agree barker say
prior to race we would have agree
we just do not think it ' right in the middle of a series
the kiwis believe that oracle would not be argue now for high wind limit if it do not happen to be sail particularly well in strong condition
spithill say his team 's conservative approach in may be due to simpson 's death
it be a huge tragedy he say
but as we have both go along and i think since the start of this regatta the confidence both team have get now and you see the racing how hard we 're push it seem like the team be up for it
apparently not
but spithill continue to project plenty of positive energy and with the cup in the balance he clearly win the start on thursday after barker and team new zealand get too close to the line too early
spithill perform a cocksure hook maneuver to get around the kiwis and force them to tack away from the line to avoid a penalty
oracle cross the start with a three boat length lead and never trail look particularly impressive upwind fully foil and hit speed in excess of 30 knot that once would have be unthinkable in cup racing
i think the way the guy be sail the boat be the best we have sail it spithill say
upwind and foil in that sort of breeze be pretty impressive and it be really just zero mistake
more much more glitch free sailing will presumably be require if spithill and his crew be to keep postpone kiwi celebration and work toward what would be the great america 's cup comeback in its 162-year history
because of sukkot alternate side street cleaning regulation will be suspend in new york city on friday
other regulation will remain in effect
boston no one seem happy the other day than mayor thomas m. menino as he join in the ceremonial groundbreaking for a high rise tower at the site of the old filene 's department store in downtown boston
under blue sky a brass band strike up a sousa march a forest worth of white confetti swirl down on the assemble crowd and the mayor wear a sharp new suit and tie proclaim the dawn of a new era
the start of construction celebrate the beginning of a new chapter in the history of this historic building and highlight the promising future that be in store for this neighborhood he say
it be a scene that have be repeat itself with some frequency these day as mr. menino the city 's longest serve mayor prepare to leave office
during his 20-year tenure he have oversee the addition of 80 million square foot of development increase the city 's total square footage of office and residential space by 11 percent
the project range from the $ 1 billion boston convention and exhibition center complete in 2004 to almost 12,000 college dormitory room
he have back a new casino he propose spend $ 16 billion in private and public money to build 30,000 housing unit by 2020 and developer be plan a new residential tower at the christian science plaza that at 691 foot will become the tall residential build in the boston skyline
we call it the menino effect say peter meade director of the boston redevelopment authority which oversee all construction project in the city
as mr. menino 's time in city hall run out the pace of development be accelerate evidence by the construction crane puncture the cityscape at virtually every turn
last year about $ 4 billion be invest in project this year $ 5.1 billion be expect
the vibrant local economy fuel by growth in food service and computer relate industry with a strong underpinning in biotechnology education and health care be drive the building boom
moody 's last year call boston the strong commercial real estate market in the country since the 2008 recession
those industry be grow along with the city 's population which reach 636,000 in 2012 not as high as its peak of 800,000 in 1950 but up more than 3 percent since 2010
the building spree may be partly a function of mr. menino himself
three year ago the mayor say i want to get stuff done,'â mr. meade recall

so this be the b.r.a. be commit to get stuff do
others have suggest that the mayor 's departure may be prompt some developer to speed up their plan because they expect the change in administration to slow down the process at least initially as new people move into new job
you have the demand and interest rate be still relatively low but this be couple with a fear of the unknown say michael k. vaughan president of nauset strategies a real estate consulting firm
developer property owner builder have 20 year invest in this relationship he say
there ' a sense of let 's get this stuff do because you do not know what ' around the corner
some of the candidate who be run to succeed mr. menino the preliminary election with 12 candidate be tuesday want him to scale back worry that his $ 16 billion housing plan in particular could saddle the city with debt
another concern be that the building boom be gentrify some neighborhood to the point where resident be be price out
we 're commit to so many thing i worry we will be handcuff bill walczak one of the candidate say at a recent debate
mr. menino brush off the criticism say he intend to finish his tenure on a strong note and would be roll out even more initiative in the come week
after two decade in office mr. menino 's hold over every aspect of city life be complete and his power to make or break any construction project be legendary
the filene 's property be a case in point
a few year ago it be be develop by vornado realty trust base in new york but construction have stall because of the recession leave a crater in the middle of the city 's historic shopping district
the company 's chief executive steven roth suggest that he may have deliberately allow the site to become an eyesore to put pressure on the city for a tax break
this incense the mayor who give no tax break
vornado never resume construction and eventually millennium partners another new york developer but one with a good relationship with the mayor take over the project
on the eve of the groundbreaking this week the menino administration reverse itself and agree to give $ 7.8 million in tax break to help millennium partners attract retail and office tenant to the $ 630 million development
at the groundbreaking the mayor defend the tax credit say the project would generate $ 60 million in new property tax and stimulate the downtown economy
david begelfer chief executive of naiop massachusetts a commercial real estate development association say that market force rather than a mayor drive a building boom
but he suggest nonetheless that mr. menino may have be think of his legacy when he propose build the 30,000 new housing unit
and of the tax break for the filene 's project mr. begelfer laugh and say there be something to be say for have a relationship with the power that be
detroit
in an emotional hearing detroit resident protest the city 's bankruptcy filing plead on thursday with a federal judge to protect employee pension and essential service from cut they say would be devastating
william j. howard who retire after 35 year in the city 's water department describe work night and weekend repair detroit 's sewer and incinerator
during that time i work in human waste with my fellow employee work to serve the city of detroit mr. howard say
my fellow employee and i be entitle to a pension
i pray that your honor object to this bankruptcy
his testimony and that of others home in on some of the tough question before the judge steven w. rhodes of united states bankruptcy court as the case head toward critical hearing next month on detroit 's eligibility to file for chapter 9
opponent of the bankruptcy lead by the city 's public employee union have argue that the filing in july violate michigan 's constitution which expressly protect pension right for worker
they also assert that the state appoint emergency manager kevyn d. orr do not bargain fairly with union bondholder and other creditor to cut cost and debt before recommend bankruptcy the nation 's large municipal bankruptcy filing to gov. rick snyder
the city be try to reduce an estimate $ 18.5 billion in long term debt
judge rhodes have so far reserved decision on the pension and bargaining issue until formal eligibility hearing start on oct. 23
he also order hundred of creditor to participate in mediation session before then to possibly reduce some of the city 's debt
but the judge make it clear thursday that he consider the testimony of resident retiree and community leader to be a key element in decide whether detroit should be in bankruptcy and how its 700,000 resident and rank and file worker should be treat
everyone who have a stake in the outcome of this case should take the time to listen to this the judge say
the hearing have its difficult moment
one woman lucinda darrah be remove by a security guard when she refuse to leave the microphone after the three minute limit
and temper flare at time when resident raise a racial issue whether mr. snyder a republican who be white have deliberately impose emergency manager on several michigan city that have largely black population
sheilah johnson who work for the city for 28 year say she fear lose her $ 3,000 monthly pension and blame mr. orr and mr. snyder for seize control of the city from its voter and elect official
we do not need a dictator she say
we do not need a slave owner
i be not a slave
while judge rhodes caution people against make personal attack on mr. orr and others the frustration and anger of many homeowner and retiree repeatedly boil over
paulette brown who rise from a junior typist to a manager during her 30-year career with the city say longtime employee be be treat bad than animal in the bankruptcy
i object to be refer to as a creditor she say
we do our part and we need the city of detroit to continue to do theirs
others express concern that the dismal state of city service like police and fire protection would get bad because of cut impose in bankruptcy
one resident jean vorkamp tell of how a gunshot victim lay dead on her street last month for five hour because of staffing reduction in the county coroner 's office
this be austerity she say
and there be no more room for any more austerity in detroit
bankruptcy expert say that allow resident and retiree to testify be a prudent and compassionate move by judge rhodes but not one that will likely affect whether the city be find legally eligible to file for bankruptcy
an individual objector that do not have a lot of resource be probably not go to make an adequate case with sufficient evidence to overcome the city 's argument on those issue say michael a. sweet a bankruptcy lawyer with the firm fox rothschild
yet the stir anecdotal testimony of regular detroiters seem to frame the case in way far different from the legal issue at stake
cynthia blair the widow of a detroit police officer say she rely on her husband 's pension to make a home for her family
the bankruptcy could take me and my daughter 's pension away she say
and we would be throw directly to the welfare roll
about half of the 110 individual who file objection to the bankruptcy testify on thursday
judge rhodes say he find their statement move thoughtful and passionate and call the hearing a truly extraordinary session of the court
a second hearing on thursday address a motion by a retiree committee represent former city worker
the committee be seek a stay of the bankruptcy and all further hearing until the michigan constitutional issue be settle
the committee 's lawyer claude montgomery argue that the question about the state 's protection of pension should be deal with in federal district court rather than in bankruptcy court
judge rhodes indicate that he believe the city could not afford to squander any time in its effort to restore service and fix its finance
if we put off the eligibility hearing we delay the whole process he say
the second hearing conclude without a decision from the judge who say he would rule on the issue within a few day

john sterling 's quarter century of baritone bombast mistake bizarrely creative home run call and unalloyed joy at yankees victory thuuuuuh yankees win have make him an odd but solid part of the yankees brand
a singular divisive much debate personality sterling seem likely to move with the yankees radio right next season from wcbs am to wfan which will simulcast the game at 660 am and 101.9 fm. if sterling return with or without suzyn waldman it will not be because he be a great broadcaster
he be frequently awful and laughable yet unforgettable in his overblown way
his return would seem to be predicate on lengthy service as a yankees homer
longevity be a wonderful asset for a local baseball announcer
it help build a fan base even if you 're not sublime
have bob gamere last as a yankees voice beyond his nearly forget season in 1970 he may have build a follow
sterling 's penchant for miscall a play or not describe action with absolute accuracy be maddening and suggest a problem with his eyesight
on tuesday in toronto he saw something that do not happen or perhaps he call something he wish have happen
with r. a. dickey pitching to alex rodriguez sterling say swung on and drill to deep right center field
that ball be high it be far it be go
over the wall
he pause and then add oh it hit and kick over
but it have not go over the wall
after another pause he say i 'm sorry
i be sorry
i get that call wrong
i get that all wrong
at the wall davis make the catch
honestly i do not think he make it
i think he give up on the ball
that ' why i think it be out
on the yes network michael kay say drive out into right center field
davis back and he will make the play for the second out
on the blue jays radio broadcast jerry howarth say rodriguez line one up the gap and into deep right center field
move back rajai davis and he make a backhanded catch on the track
there be no visual sign that davis have give up on the ball
kay and howarth saw the routine play clearly
sterling get it wrong in many way and delay correct himself while exaggerate davis 's nearness to the wall he make the catch as he cross onto the warning track
but at least he apologize
what yankees management think of sterling be not publicly know
randy levine the team president would not comment thursday
whether levine and hal steinbrenner have comb through sterling 's radio archive in the past before renew his contract be unknown too
perhaps management put sterling 's faux pa and nutty shtick an a bomb for a rod in the category of phil rizzuto 's ignore play to send birthday wish to fan or leave early to beat the traffic home to new jersey
rizzuto be endearing and beloved almost sweet
sterling
not so much
but be he eccentric
oh my
on aug. 8 2012 he star in another episode of weird but true yankees classics
casey mcgehee lead off the fourth inning against detroit starter anibal sanchez
cut and miss sterling say
no the bat meet the ball
no he cut and hit a fly ball down the left field line and the ball be foul
it be not a foul ball but a sharply hit ground ball
mcgehee be head toward second base as the throw come in and he ' stay at second
sterling sound a bit surprised but mcgehee have hit a ball that bounce fair over third base but land foul
the ball go down the left field line and it must have hit it and kick in the seat for a ground rule double
the ball do not kick into the stand and it be not a ground rule double
a supportive partner waldman say we all miss it no other tigers or yankees announcer do and add that the ball be in the air it fly over the bag
there be no fly
honest
the call be skewer the next morning by the wfan host craig carton and boomer esiason carton end their seven minute analysis with a plea to the yankees to sign sterling and waldman to a five year deal
i can not live without them he say
he describe their broadcast as unique
he say they produce the most colloquial broadcast ever and would be miss if they be replace by perfectly competent announcer who would not be idiosyncratic or memorable
esiason and carton have no reason to believe back then that they would ever share a station with the yankees and possibly sterling
but next season carton be carton will probably invite sterling into the station 's studio to analyze sterling
imagine that carton and sterling belly to belly

the obama administration have decide to revive a controversial loan guarantee program at the energy department administration official say on thursday even as the program remain under congressional scrutiny after lose hundred of million in taxpayer money on investment in fail green energy start ups like the solar module maker solyndra
this time though the program would devote as much as $ 8 billion to help industry like coal and oil make clean energy
although the program which do not require congressional approval would support a wide range of technology it could help coal fire power plant find a way to keep their emission from escape into the atmosphere department official say
official say the federal subsidy be necessary to support the development of technology that be too complex unproven and expensive for investor and private company to pursue on their own assertion that have already stir criticism from opponent who see the program as too risky and a misuse of taxpayer money
the program 's renewal come just as the administration be release stringent environmental rule that would severely restrict air pollution at new coal plant
we have a real problem and that '
how do we get new technology to market?'â say peter w. davidson executive director of the loan program office at the energy department
we partner with industry developer and entrepreneur to demonstrate a new technology at industrial scale or utility scale and hopefully once that technology be prove by deployment at scale we step out of the way and let the private debt market take over
a spokeswoman for the house committee on energy and commerce which be control by republicans who have be critical of the loan in the past take a skeptical view of the program
the d.o.e. loan guarantee program 's history of mismanagement bankruptcy and failure to deliver the job promise raise significant concern about risk billion in additional taxpayer dollar charlotte baker say
we be supportive of effort to encourage the development of advanced fossil fuel technology but we be skeptical that federal loan guarantee be the best way to bring this about
analyst and climate expert also question whether the program which be originally establish in 2005 and whose new guideline will be complete this fall could make the technology economically viable on a mass scale
there be currently no venture in the united states that achieve this despite year of government sponsor research and development accord to the congressional research service
an ambitious clean coal demonstration project call futuregen propose by president george w. bush in 2003 have yet to advance beyond the early development stage
it seem sound policy for the administration to provide these loan guarantee say paul bledsoe a former energy aide in the clinton white house who be now a senior fellow at the german marshall fund

the real question become be that adequate to actually prompt significant number of new build and i think that the answer so far be no
the energy department 's loan program be create in 2005 under president bush to spur commercial adoption of innovative technology or those that avoid reduce or permanently store pollutant
in 2008 congress add another section for more fuel efficient car and a year later create a temporary program to encourage renewable energy and electrical transmission project
that temporary program which be responsible for the solyndra loan have since expire but the department still have about $ 50 billion leave that could be lend with a large chunk earmark for nuclear project
the department point to several successful investment from the loan program
ernest j. moniz the energy secretary have point to tesla motors early repayment of $ 465 million as an example
mr. davidson say that since his office finance the first six large scale photovoltaic solar farm in 2010 and 2011 10 big solar power plant have start or finished construction without any federal money
on a $ 34 billion loan portfolio the government have lose about $ 800 million he say
that ' about 2.3 percent and only a small fraction of the $ 10 billion congress set aside to cover loss 1 2 next page

alton iowa the puny yellow corn stalk stand like weary sentry on one boundary of dennis von arb 's field here
on a windy day this spring his neighbor spray glyphosate on his field and some of the herbicide blow onto mr. von arb 's conventionally grow corn kill the first few row
he ' more concerned though about the soil
during heavy rain in the summer the runoff from his neighbor 's farm soak his field with glyphosate laden water
anything you put on the land affect the chemistry and biology of the land and that ' a powerful pesticide mr. von arb say
but 20 mile down the road brad vermeer brush aside such concern
he grow traited or biotech corn and soy on some 1,500 acre and estimate that his yield would fall by 20 percent if he switch to conventional crop and stop use glyphosate know by brand name like roundup and buccaneer
in short it be just too profitable to give up
local agronomist be start to say we have to get away from roundup mr. vermeer say
but they 're go to have to show me that conventional genetics can produce the same income
the local difference over glyphosate be feed the long run debate over biotech crop which currently account for roughly 90 percent of the corn soybean and sugar beet grow in the united states
while regulator and many scientist say biotech crop be no different from their conventional cousin others worry that they be damage the environment and human health

the use of the herbicide have grow exponentially along with biotech crop
the pervasive use though be prompt some concern
critic point in part to the rise of so call superweeds which be more resistant to the herbicide
to fight them farmer sometimes have to spray the toxic herbicide two to three time during the grow season
then there be the feel of the soil
dirt in two field around alton where biotech corn be be grow be hard and compact
pry corn stalk from the soil with a shovel be difficult and when the plant finally come up their root be trap in a chunk of dirt
once free the root spread out flat like a fan and be stud with only a few nodule which be critical to the exchange of nutrient
in comparison conventional corn in adjacent field could be tug from the ground by hand and dirt with the consistency of wet coffee ground fall off the corn plant knobby root
because glyphosate move into the soil from the plant it seem to affect the rhizosphere the ecology around the root zone which in turn can affect plant health say robert kremer a scientist at the united states agriculture department who have study the impact of glyphosate on soybean for more than a decade and have warn of the herbicide 's impact on soil health
like the human microbiome the plant root system rely on a complex system of bacteria fungi and mineral in the soil
the combination in the right balance help protect the crop from disease and improve photosynthesis
in some study scientist have find that a big selling point for the pesticide that it bind tightly to mineral in the soil like calcium boron and manganese thus prevent runoff also mean it compete with plant for those nutrient
other research indicate that glyphosate can alter the mix of bacteria and fungi that interact with plant root system make them more susceptible to parasite and pathogen
antibiotic kill bacteria or reduce their growth but some of those bacteria be useful say verlyn sneller president of verity a small company that sell sugar base fertilizer and water system and work to persuade farmer like mr. vermeer to switch to conventional crop
but research detail the adverse effect with glyphosate be limited and other study counter such finding
monsanto which sell roundup and seed resistant to glyphosate say there be no credible evidence that the herbicide cause extend adverse effect to microbial process in soil
a team of scientist from the agriculture department similarly review much of the research and find the herbicide to be fairly benign
in response to a request from monsanto the environmental protection agency recently increase the amount of glyphosate that be allow on food and fee crop 1 2 next page

washington a year after a plan by president obama to limit greenhouse ga emission from new power plant set off angry opposition the administration will announce on friday that it be not back down from a confrontation with the coal industry and will press ahead with enact the first federal carbon limit on the nation 's power company
the propose regulation to be announce at the national press club by gina mccarthy the administrator of the environmental protection agency be an aggressive move by mr. obama to bypass congress on climate change with executive action he promise in his inaugural address this year
the regulation be certain to be denounce by house republicans and the industry as part of what they call the president 's war on coal
in her speech ms. mccarthy will unveil the agency 's proposal to limit new ga fire power plant to 1,000 pound of carbon dioxide emission per megawatt hour and new coal plant to 1,100 pound of carbon dioxide accord to administration official who be brief on the agency 's plan
industry official say the average advanced coal plant currently emit about 1,800 pound of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour
new power plant both natural ga and coal fire can minimize their carbon emission by take advantage of modern technology ms. mccarthy will sayâ friday accord to her prepared remark
simply put these standard represent the clean standard we have put forth for new natural ga plant and new coal plant
aide say ms. mccarthy would also announce a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour a series of meeting across the country with the public the industry and environmental group as the agency work to establish emission limit on exist power plant a far more costly and controversial step
mr. obama have tell official he want to see greenhouse ga limit on both exist and new power plant by the time he leave office in 2017
we will respond to the threat of climate change know that the failure to do so would betray our child and future generation mr. obama say in january
but he acknowledge that the path toward sustainable energy source will be long and sometimes difficult
the limit to be unveil friday be a slightly more relaxed standard for coal plant than the administration first propose in april 2012
official say the new plan which come after the e.p.a. receive more than 2.5 million comment from the public and industry will give coal plant operator more flexibility to meet the limit over several year
still environmental group be likely to hail the announcement as an important step in target the large source of greenhouse ga emission in the country
forty percent of all energy relate emission of greenhouse gas in 2012 come from power plant and most of that come from coal burn power plant accord to the energy information administration
we be thrilled that the e.p.a. be take this major step forward in implement president obama 's climate action plan say tiernan sittenfeld a senior vice president at the league of conservation voters in anticipation of ms. mccarthy 's announcement
it ' a great day for public heath and a clean energy future
but republican lawmaker and industry official have already attack the expected proposal
opponent of the new rule argue that the technology to affordably reduce carbon emission at power plant be not yet available and will drastically increase the cost of electricity
senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the senate republican leader and a fierce advocate for coal in a coal dependent state say in an interview thursday that he expect the bad
although he have not see the administration 's late proposal mr. mcconnell say it be likely to alarm people in his state
it ' a devastating blow to our state and we 're go to fight it in every way we can mr. mcconnell say
scott segal the director of the electric reliability coordinating council which represent power company say the detail he have hear about the rule suggest that the administration would drive investment away from a plentiful source of power
i 'm afraid it ' go to be illegal counterproductive from an environmental perspective and contrary to our long range interest in create job hold down cost and produce reliable energy mr. segal say
the rule on new power plant will soon face a 60-day public comment period likely to be follow by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenge
official say the rule could be finalize by the fall of 2014
once the rule be in place coal power plant would be require to limit their emission likely by instal technology call carbon capture and sequestration which scrub carbon dioxide from their emission before they reach the plant smokestack
the technology then pump it into permanent storage underground
industry representative argue that such technology have not be prove on a large scale and would be extraordinarily expensive and therefore in violation of provision in the clean air act that require the regulation to be adequately demonstrate and not exorbitant in cost
i think the agency have real problem meet both of those standard mr. segal say
but e.p.a. official argue that the carbon capture technology have be use in several location and that a review of the industry over the past year prove that owner of new coal fire power plant can meet the new standard as require by the act
senator edward j. markey democrat of massachusetts say in a statement that the propose rule would begin a new era in which the united states begin real effort to control climate alter pollution from the nation 's power plant
these rule be reasonable mr. markey say
they be feasible
and they should soon be expand to include standard for exist power plant
in one concession to the industry official say the agency would provide some flexibility
plant that could install the technology within 12 month would be require to meet the 1,100-pound limit official say
owner of coal plant would also have the option of phase in the limit over a seven year period official say
but those plant would be require to meet a strict standard of 1,000 to 1,050 pound per megawatt hour average over the seven year
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 21 2013an article on friday about the obama administration 's plan to enact the first federal carbon limit on the nation 's power company refer incorrectly to the amount of carbon dioxide emission from the average advanced coal plant
it be 1,800 pound of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour not per hour
toronto there may be some complex equation and intricate algorithm that prove the yankees still have a mathematical chance to reach the playoff
but the visible evidence tell a different story
need a win to keep up their momentum from an emotional victory the night before the yankees instead endure a 6 2 loss to the last place toronto blue jays on thursday night at rogers centre that leave them three and a half game behind the texas rangers and the tampa bay rays for one of the two wild card spot in the american league
there be also three other wild card contender ahead of the yankees who have only nine game remain
for the yankees to make the playoff it would require a collapse of historic proportion from multiple team and that be what they be bank on
as long as we 're not mathematically out of it we have still get a chance outfielder vernon wells say
there ' not a person in this room that feel any differently
but as third baseman mark reynolds put it it ' pretty desperate
with injury and exhaustion bear down on them the yankees conclude their three city 11-day trip with a 4 6 record
they win three of four in baltimore and go into friday 's game at boston one game out of a playoff spot
but they lose all three game at fenway park in humiliating fashion and five of the last six on the trip
we run into the red sox wave and we have not recover alex rodriguez say
but tomorrow be a good time to get on our home field and play some good baseball
good baseball be not something the yankees have play since their charter jet leave baltimore last week aside from the eighth inning wednesday when they rally for four run
the offense which manage only five hit thursday have be stagnant and fatigue seem to be affect nearly everyone
that include joba chamberlain who give up a three run homer to adam lind in the seventh inning that put thursday 's game out of reach
it be a tough road trip alfonso soriano say
you can blame it on that
we get tired
we go home tonight and we have six very important game at home
hiroki kuroda start and have runner on base throughout his six inning of work
curtis granderson hit a home run in the sixth that close the yankees deficit to 2 1 but kuroda give up a home run to anthony gose in the bottom of the inning that put the blue jays ahead by 3 1
with the yankees trail by two run in the seventh manager joe girardi summon chamberlain who have be use primarily in mop up situation in the second half of the season
in this case the game be still competitive and the season may have be hang in the balance
chamberlain promptly give up a leadoff walk a single and the home run to lind
girardi explain that he do not want to use david robertson if possible
he have the left hander cesar cabral warm up before lind 's at bat but decide to go with the more experienced option in chamberlain
he ' be throw the ball pretty well girardi say
but he do not do it tonight
the yankees do not score until granderson hit his home run in the sixth attack a 1 2 fastball that be up in the zone and drive it into the seat in right field for his seventh home run
rodriguez follow him and tap out to short make him 1 for 19 since the end of the series against the orioles on sept. 12
the yankees put together a mod rally in the ninth to score one run but it be far too late
the decisive blow of the game and perhaps the season have already be strike by lind leave the yankees to reflect on what permutation of their victory and their opponent loss would get them into the postseason
the yankees have six game leave at home three against the san francisco giants begin friday and then three against the rays
the yankees must also hope that the cleveland indians the baltimore orioles and the kansas city royals all lose
reynolds say the yankees have to run the table
soriano say they could secure a playoff berth by win eight of nine or even seven of nine depend on what the other team do
shortstop brendan ryan who have be watch the other relevant game on his iphone at his locker after the game against the blue jays curse when he saw that the indians have beat the houston astros in 11 inning
it be another game that do not go the yankees way thursday make the math even more difficult
it ' not a time to reflect rodriguez say
it ' a time to win game
inside pitch alex rodriguez recover from hamstring and calf strain take some fielding practice thursday and say he hop he would play third base before the season end

andy pettitte say he prefer not to discuss his upcoming deposition for brian mcnamee 's civil suit against roger clemens.

when you think about m.s. the main thing be not to be overheat and not to be stress sigalet say in a telephone interview earlier this year
when you think about a goalie it ' probably the bad for all those thing
people always think you 're in an ice rink it ' cold out there
but you have 50 pound of equipment on

the report to be issue on friday do not refer specifically to president obama 's suggestion last month that law school may limit class to two year and have student spend their third year clerking or practice in a firm
but it do recommend the elimination of the rule that law student must have 45,000 minute in a classroom to graduate and that they can not get credit for field placement that be pay
the report describe an urgent need for change in the nation 's legal education
â the system face considerable pressure because of the price many student pay the large amount of student debt consecutive year of sharply fall application and dramatic change possibly structural in the job available to law graduate it say
â these have result in real economic stress on law school damage to career and economic prospect of many recent graduate and diminish public confidence in the system of legal education
it call â the predicament of the many recent graduate who may never get the kind of job they anticipate â particularly compelling
the report be still a draft to be distribute for comment then consider at the bar association 's 2014 meeting
if adopt there it will be influential but not bind on either law school or state bar association

the report criticize the practice of most law school to provide little aid to needy student reserve most of their scholarship for those with the high credential in part to help raise the school 's ranking
there be very prickly long discussion about whether the language in the report accurately describe the situation mr. shepard say
the other issue where there be real disagreement be on the list of item in the accreditation standard that we think should be liberalize or eliminate
among the item on the list be â the standard on credit â for â work â before law school matriculation distance education student faculty ratio the proportion of course teach by full time faculty tenure physical facility and more
the overall idea say james
b. kobak jr. a new york lawyer on the task force be to free law school to be more innovative and get away from the one size fit all model
but leo p. martinez a task force member who be president of the association of american law schools say that while he generally embrace the idea of encouraging heterogeneity among law school he think the standard help to ensure an irreducible minimum of quality
â mr. shepard say that there have be little controversy over the use of â nonlawyer practitioner in part â because the member be so impressed by washington state 's experiment with limited license legal technician train and license to handle certain civil legal matter
that program 's success have lead to an expansion to practitioner for domestic relation an area in which many of those who come to court be now unrepresented
the report cite the wide variety of college in the united states call for more differentiation and experimentation by law school

perhaps the only point on which gun enthusiast and gun control advocate agree be that firearm should be keep out of the hand of criminal and the insane
supply a gun to someone who subsequently use it in commit a crime facilitate and abet that crime
it follow that anyone who supply a gun to another that be then use to commit a crime be an accessory to that crime
supply can mean sell the gun give it lend it or merely leave it out where it can be take rather than safely lock away and include allow it to be steal by a housebreaker the source of many gun use by criminal
it may be argue that gun owner should not be blame for the use someone else make of their weapon but gun right supporter often emphasize responsible gun ownership
what do such responsibility mean if not keep gun out of dangerous hand
just as someone who provide financial service or who sell or rent house be exhort to know your customer be it not the responsibility of gun owner and those who sell gun to take precaution against let criminal or maniac get hold of them
i propose that federal legislation be enact that would treat anyone who supply a firearm to another person who later use it in commit a criminal act as an accessory to that act punishable as a principal
in the case of gun that have pass through several hand as be often the case the last identifiable owner should be hold responsible
david l. book monterey california
julia wurz be the medium executive for the formula one team that be benetton and then become renault from 1998 to 2001
she be married to the former formula one driver alexander wurz and run her own public relation agency base in monaco
she speak with brad spurgeon of the international herald tribune about superego her first novel
q. how do you get the idea of write the novel
a.
it be actually after read the devil wear prada
i like the book and i think but i know people more extreme than this
and i think it be an angle to come in on that i could do something so similar and yet that it be an angle that have never be do about formula one
q. how big be the challenge to make vincent dupont the main character and the plot believable
a. that be exactly my goal
vincent 's behavior be extreme but not that extreme that anyone who work in formula one would think be totally unrealistic
i want you to totally believe that that guy would be here would do that to think i can see him i know the guy
my benchmark be that i want formula one people to say i could believe that could happen
q. how important be it to have formula one very much a man 's world see through a woman 's eye
a. i feel it have to be a girl 's view to get that one step remove
because i think it be such a man 's world that otherwise you can not quite take that step back to see when certain situation have get to a certain ridiculousness or an irony
it be very easy to get lose in it
a girl can never totally penetrate this world
so it give it a chance to just have a step back and look
which i feel be important because kate be a fan but it be also give that extra slight distance
q. do you aim to interest non f1 fan
a. i read book in industry that i know nothing about and if the story be good i also like to learn about something totally different or life in a different country
so i hope the book function on the two level one for people who like formula one but also for people who like a good story and an intrigue that work
it may seem that there could be no big contrast than that between rid a unicycle and drive the fast racing car in the world
the former be one of the slow form of wheel transportation while the latter be the fast
yet as a lifetime fan of formula one and a longtime rider of unicycle i come to suspect that there be in fact a big connection between the two than meet the eye
over the year i have repeatedly discover formula one driver past and present who have ride unicycle before graduate to the big four wheel machine
the first i learn of it be when i saw mika hakkinen rid a unicycle as he celebrate his world driver title in 1998 when he drive for mclaren mercedes
i later meet an irish former formula one driver david kennedy who have ride a unicycle in the 1970
more recently i discover that lewis hamilton and nico rosberg who be childhood friend race rival and as of this year teammates at the mercedes team have also ride unicycle as teenager
and last year i saw a short video clip of jean-ãric vergne a driver at the toro rosso team rid a unicycle when he visit the cirque du soleil in montreal
in a related vein i also know that alexander wurz who race for several formula one team from 1997 to 2007 have win the world championship of bmx cycling at the age of 13
so i begin to wonder if there be some connection between cycling balance and auto racing and i decide to investigate by bring my unicycle to the belgian grand prix last month
there i watch as both vergne and rosberg give it a spin around the paddock
despite their claim to have not really ride a unicycle for year both driver be able to jump on it and ride around without a single fall to my great relief on their first attempt
i ask wurz who at 39 still compete in the top level of sport car racing and also teach race drive course to young driver at the international automobile federation the govern body of auto sport if he think there be a cycling/rac connection
if we talk of the talent of a racing driver part of whatever talent be define will be balance skill quite a large part wurz say
all of the driver turn out to have very good balance and they can use their balance skill to learn very quickly
so you would maybe see that most of the driver even if they have not touch a unicycle very quickly get it
he be right
my recollection of learn the unicycle at about 15 be that it take me at least two week to get it
but hamilton accord to rosberg learn to ride his unicycle in a couple of hour
the fiercely competitive hamilton be extra motivate by the fact that rosberg have his unicycle first
rosberg 's father keke rosberg a former formula one driver have manage hakkinen 's career and know that the finnish driver have go to circus school and use to ride his unicycle to high school through the snow
hakkinen be also know as something of an acrobatic formula one driver and his skill be link to the unicycle
rosberg say that he receive his unicycle as a present for christmas

and when i get such a challenge i always make it happen he say
what he do not count on be that when hamilton his teammate in go karting at the time saw rosberg rid the unicycle in the paddock he have to do it too
he be the one with a unicycle and be as competitive as i be i want to be able to do it as well say hamilton who like rosberg be 28
he be really good at it and then i get it and practice and practice and practice add i have to be better than him
eventually i could do it backwards and everything and eventually he give up
vergne 's discovery of the unicycle also have a go karting link
he learn how to ride the unicycle at his parent 's go karting track business outside paris aim to improve his balance so that he would be a better racing car driver
i start at 14 15 year old on my parent 's karting track say vergne 23
my dad tell me that it be always important to have a good sense of balance in auto racing and we think that it be a good idea for me to learn how to do that so i learn how to do it
he say that although he could not feel a direct link between unicycling and auto racing he say it be clear that balance be important
balance be important to feel the car better especially in change condition of the track he say
and be a little bit of an acrobat and know when the car be go to slide be important
wurz say it be the same with bmx.
it ' all about balance in bmx he say
it be very much about balance and feeling the grip you have on the gravel in corner how much speed you can carry the jump the starting gate
cycling be all to do with use balance and a sense of gravity to your advantage
to feel the limit of the car you need to understand how much your car be roll what your tire be do when the tire be grip and that be a balance skill he add
still while i have not the slight doubt that if i try drive a formula one car i would reach speed only roughly half those of these great driver i be pleased to learn that vergne and i do actually share the same technique for learn the unicycle by fall down a lot as he say
the marina bay temporary street circuit on which the singapore grand prix run this weekend be the second slow track of the season after monaco with an average speed of 172 kilometer per hour and an average cornering speed of 105 k.p.h
with its 23 corner extreme heat and humidity and night run singapore 's 106.8-mile race be one of the season 's hardest on the car brake tire and driver leave no part of the setup unpunished
it ' a bumpy track and because it be use just once a year for the grand prix the grip change throughout the weekend as it collect rubber from both the elite competitor car and those of the support race
that mean that the team must spend the entire weekend try to deal with the continually move target of the best car setup
ten of the corner be in the final sector of the track driver change gear more than 5,000 time during the race and at more than 100 second the lap time be the long of the year
in fact with its 61 lap the race have either reach the official two hour limit as it do last year or go to within five minute of the limit every year since the first singapore grand prix in 2008
approximately 46 percent of the lap be take at full throttle compare with more than 75 percent at the previous race at the high speed low downforce track in monza italy
singapore 's twisty layout be hard on brake and with all the gear change on the gearbox
the marina bay circuit have a low average speed due to the high amount of corner say remi taffin the head of the renault engine provider 's track operation
so the emphasis be on give the driver driveability through the low rev range between 8,000 r.p.m and
13,000 r.p.m
and a responsive engine on the short link between the right angle turn he say
engine map need to give good traction so this be a race we will work particularly closely with the chassis engineer to get a neutral set up
pirelli will provide the team its medium and supersoft tire
the tight and twisty corner make the supersoft version not use since the canadian grand prix in june the right tire to generate traction and grip while the medium tire contribute extra durability
the second half of the season start off with two of the fast and most demanding race for tire of the year in belgium and italy say paul hembery the director of the pirelli tire motor sport program
singapore be a completely different challenge the final street race of the season which be ideal territory for the supersoft tire he add
as always our selection have concentrate on provide the best opportunity for strategy as well as the most effective race tire
because it be a long race the car carry one of the heavy fuel load of the year
that put a lot more energy into the tire at the start of the race require particular attention to manage the first stint
one of the big cause of tire wear however be wheel spin
so the rear suspension must be set up to give maximum longitudinal grip
unusual for a street race singapore be hot and humid with high speed heavy braking area and so many corner
the tire have to perform well under traction and braking
the only relief for the tire be that because it be a night race the track temperature drop from a high of around 50 degree celsius 122 degree fahrenheit in the day to around 30 degree celsius 86 degree fahrenheit during the race
but that still make for a hot and humid race one of the tough of the season
twenty percent of the lap be do on braking and 45 percent at full throttle
driver undergo 2.5g 's for three second at turn 22
all the corner be generally take in second or third gear so you 're try to find the best setup compromise say jenson button a driver at the mclaren mercedes team particularly as you need good end of straight speed for overtake into turn 7
because it be a bumpy circuit the setup must favor the mechanical over the aerodynamic
but its slow twisty nature also require maximum downforce on both the front and rear wing
the many high curb require good suspension compliance and the frequent braking require the car to be set up soft
brake cooling like engine cooling be difficult not so much because of hard braking but because of frequent braking throughout the whole lap
the wear and tear be on all part of the brake disc pad and caliper
to help cool the engine the car 's bodywork must often be open in various place
formula one have always be an innovative force in technology for road car as the sport 's team seek quick reliable solution to create better faster car in an environment that be more competitive and evolve fast than that of the consumer car industry
in recent year however as the series have move away from purely mechanical to electronic system in the race car in the pit lane garage and the whole team environment of a race innovation from the series have expand far beyond the realm of the automobile
they now extend into many other aspect of daily life from train the military and hospital operating room staff use pit stop tactic to design watch and luggage with formula one car material and technique
one of the most advanced extension of the lesson learn through the harsh competitive environment of a formula one race be now help to create a future that will touch on just about every aspect of life
know as the internet of thing it have to do with the electronic connectivity of our everyday life and the vast network that have already begin to connect everything from our car to the road to our home and hospital and even agriculture with the smart cow with biometric monitoring and analysis watch grazing rotation and milk solid data analysis
the mclaren formula one team have even connect sick baby with their telemetry system in a hospital in britain to provide early warning of ailment like a heart attack
in fact no other team of the sport 's elite racing team be as deeply involve in the study of improve the internet of thing as be the mclaren team through its sister company mclaren electronic systems
the company which be base in britain provide the engine control unit or ecu to all of the other formula one team and since last year to the nascar team in the u.s.-based auto racing series
an ecu be the electronic brain of a race car that control the engine to ensure optimal performance
it also send data back to the team garage and the team factory and that be one of the link to the internet of thing
the internet of thing consist of the billion of connection a kind of universal global neural network in the computing cloud that be expect to make almost every aspect of our life connect in the future
mclaren 's racing environment be branch out into the large world via its work with the freescale semiconductor company of austin texas which consider itself the internet of thing company
freescale provide the computer chip that be the brain and channel of this electronic equipment
in a report on the internet of thing by kaivan karimi a director of freescale semiconductor and gary atkinson a director at arm a british semiconductor and software company the author use one of the most common example to illustrate the functioning of the internet of thing a toaster
your old toaster that mechanically control the color of your toast now have an mcu a micro controller in it and the mcu control the color of your toast the author write
the toaster complete its task more consistently and reliably and because it be now a smart toaster it have the ability to communicate with you electronically use its touchpad or switch
after a device become smart through the integration of embed processing the next logical step be remote communication with the smart device to help make life easy they add

for example if i be run late at the office can i turn on my house light for security reason use my laptop or mobile phone
that be precisely where the connection to formula one and the ecu and other electronic sensor and telemetry of a formula one car come into play
freescale us formula one something of a microcosm of the wide world of the internet of thing as a laboratory for develop its chip
â» a formula one event be increasingly one in which everything be connected just like the internet of thing say peter van manen the manage director of mclaren electronic systems 1 2 next page
los angeles on friday joseph gordon levitt enter the rank of first time feature director with don jon an edgy romantic comedy he star in and also write
but in a way it ' the culmination of a direct education that stretch back to his appearance in robert redford 's 1992 big screen adaptation of the fly fishing brother in montana tale a river runs through it
the cinematographer come up to me and say you have to hit your mark exactly,'â mr. gordon levitt say recall how at 10 such an admonition would have have him fixate on the colored tape on the floor he be mean to stand on thought of dialogue and motivation out the window
then mr. redford approach him bob say i never hit my mark.'â mr. gordon levitt whose professional acting career have begin four year earlier and include more than a dozen appearance on commercial and television would later realize that mr. redford be show him how a director help a child actor give his best performance
he be put the priority back in line for me mr. gordon levitt say
it be like
yeah it ' important to try and be in the right place but let them worry about make the shot technically look right
your job be to focus on the acting.'â
since then mr. gordon levitt have absorb direct tip from all manner of gifted filmmaker
steven spielberg who direct him in lincoln teach him that a relentlessly upbeat attitude will spread to a cast and crew
you 'd think
oh steven spielberg
he must be a little blase about it by now,'â mr. gordon levitt say
but he have so much fun all day every day
the director gregg araki show him that with a labor of love project like the haunting 2005 drama mysterious skin meticulous preparation be crucial
christopher nolan who direct him in the dark knight rises and inception share important technical know how like never ever use a tow rig for scene in car because the image will end up look distractingly phony
mr. nolan also have another lesson to impart a little encouragement go a long way
on the london set of the dark knight rises mr. gordon levitt tell mr. nolan he would just finish the first draft of a script he plan to direct as well as star in
he do not laugh at me mr. gordon levitt say
he just say great and then start ask me very detailed question like what be you go to shoot it on?'â recall this exchange mr. nolan say joe 's smart the kind of guy to wear a lot of hat then remember pay a visit to mr. gordon levitt at warner brothers when he be shoot a cafe scene
there he be with his trailer and his crew he seem at home mr. nolan say add with a laugh it turn out he would get a better deal than we be ever offer
i be amazed by this
back in march when mr. gordon levitt dress in bluejeans and a striped hoodie show up at a coffee shop here in the san fernando valley he do not come off as a crafty negotiator
but he do seem as if he be be pull in a million direction
midway through ordering he turn his gaze across the street to his car and he realize he would forget to fee his meter
i already get a ticket he say sound downcast but only for a second
give the promising notice that don jon receive at the sundance film festival in january when the title be don jon 's addiction it would take more than a parking citation to dampen his great mood
not only be the movie include in many best of sundance list but critic hail mr. gordon levitt 's ability to transform his lead character the brash new jersey gym rat jon martello who love score babe brag about his conquest and stoke his internet pornography habit into the warm center of what unexpectedly evolve into a funny sad coming of age tale
self assure be how variety 's peter debruge characterize the actor 's filmmaking ability
one of the thing you get from him as a director be a very clear vision say tony danza who play jon 's oafish father in the film add that mr. gordon levitt 's clarity of focus as a youngster be best explain with an anecdote from 20 year ago
at the time they be both appear in an update of the 1951 classic angel in the outfield
one day mr. danza ask mr. gordon levitt to join him on one of their regular inline skate excursion around the oakland coliseum and he tell me no today i be go to follow the director around and try and figure out what lens he ' go to use
even as a 12-year old he be a serious kid
now 32 he be no less drive
so he would not have to cede creative control to a stable of outside financial backer he carefully conceive the don jon script to match a spare budget
i write it to not have any explosion or scene in out space he say
he also know that in demand talent sometimes forgo big paycheck in return for the promise of fun or a challenging role
to play his gum chew dream girl barbara sugarman mr. gordon levitt land the actress he write the part for scarlett johansson and corral friend like anne hathaway channing tatum and cuba gooding jr. into make self deprecate cameo
the only near hiccup in casting have to do with julianne moore whose turn as an old woman jon meet at night school become the beat heart of the movie
her agent present the script as a movie about pornography but mr. gordon levitt say that ms. moore who have appear in boogie nights be not interest in another movie on the subject
then she read it on a plane he continue and her husband be sit next to her and she turn to him and say this be not about porn at all
this be about intimacy and people connect with each other and relationships.'â
since 2009 he ' be on a win streak appear in more than a dozen feature 50/50 looper and premium rush to name a few
he ' host saturday night live twice
at this year 's academy awards he make a pair of high profile appearance deliver a nimble soft shoe with the host seth macfarlane and daniel radcliffe and photobombing two red carpet reporter so expertly that it make him an internet darling
yet wind back about 10 year and you would find mr. gordon levitt at a different stage of popularity
in the final season of 3rd rock from the sun the nbc sci fi comedy that put him on the map he ask to be let out of his contract so he could enroll at columbia university
he enjoy his book tot civilian status until as a 21st birthday present to himself he buy a copy of the editing software final cut pro
he promptly fall in love
it be like i could be write this essay or cut this little video i be start to make,'â say mr. gordon levitt who drop out of columbia and return to his native southern california to start act again
though he would be go only two year he be treat like a has be at audition
it be a very weird part of his career people do not see him in that movie star way they see him now say mr. araki who be shrewd enough to notice that not only be mr. gordon levitt 's acting skill intact but that in enlist him to play a gay rent boy in mysterious skin he would also be give this still youthful veteran a chance to turn his image on its ear
normally he be the sidekick or the funny kid mr. araki say
this be one of the first time he be cast as the sexy one
what it mean to be desirable be just one of the many theme mr. gordon levitt explore in don jon
another be grief and mr. gordon levitt admit that he draw a character 's roiling unpredictable emotion from what he go through after the 2010 death of his old brother daniel
it be drug relate but it be not a drug overdose as have be falsely report elsewhere in the press mr. gordon levitt say
always close the two found hitrecord a web site that invite artist from many discipline writing animation direction edit to collaborate on project
indeed mr. gordon levitt 's project after don jon be
hitrecord on tv a variety series start in january on the cable channel pivot
in part it will spotlight live action and animated short produce through the site
mr. gordon levitt will host
will it also follow a traditional variety show format
will there will sketch cameo appearance a bit of dance
we 're go to have all those thing mr. gordon levitt promise then offer up the muppet show of all thing as a template
it ' like a variety show but it ' not a traditional variety show because they 're all muppets
this will be a variety show but the difference be not muppets but that it ' all collaboratively make
somewhere down the line though he also plan to make a documentary about daniel a professional fire spinner know as burning dan use the video tap conversation and photo that his brother stockpile on hitrecord
one of daniel 's favorite thing say mr. gordon levitt be to turn on a small digital recorder and just let it run for hour and hour and hour as he talk to people
to make all sort of stuff out of this material say mr. gordon levitt in a low earnest voice
it will be a lifelong project for me

and then there be more complicated question about cvc the venture capital company that own a control stake in formula one and the division of revenue between cvc and the teams.â a. of which they get 62 percent
the difference be we control what we spend and they ca n't
because if you look at it very few of them be business people
if you look at their history and what they have do it ' pretty clear
they spend too much it ' as simple as that
all of the team in formula one include the one at the back of the grid could and should be make a very good profit

a. everybody be entitle to their opinion
there ' not much i can do about it
it ' because we have get a 100-year agreement that people can count on benefit from what we receive now
if we do not have any agreement it would be back to the old day when i pull thing together when they would not know what they be go to get race by race

there can not be too many people who have ever hold a position in a sport such as you have now
a. i do not know
i be sure there have be
i have never think about it like that
i be do a job and i do the best job i can do
if you try to run this whole business democratically it would not work
half of the people do not agree with each other anyway
to get something do it would take two month where we need an answer in two day
q. stirling moss be quote recently as say that you be the man he most admire for what you have achieve in formula one
who be the person whom you most admire
a.

the one that could have stop it really be ferrari
ferrari have a veto over a lot of these change when they be make and they do not veto it
if they have i would have completely support it
but as they do not
q.â if you be a correspondent interview the tsar of all motor racing what would you ask him
a. i would say can i leave

saudi arabia appear resolute it want bashar al assad out of damascus
the saudis view the fighting in syria with the same intensity that they do the civil war in yemen that rag in the 1960s as a conflict with wide and serious repercussion that will shape the political trajectory of the middle east for year to come
the syrian war present the saudis with a chance to hit three bird with one stone iran its rival for regional dominance tehran 's ally assad and his hezbollah supporter
but riyadh 's policy maker be wary
they know that once fully commit it will be difficult to disengage
and so they be take to heart the lesson of another regional war that flare on their border 50 year ago
the war in yemen that break out in 1962 when military leader oust the century old monarchy and declare a republic quickly turn into a quagmire that suck in foreign power
the soviet union provide the new regime with air support
british airstrikes aid the royalist and the united states offer warplane in a symbolic show of force
more than anything else though the conflict become a proxy war between saudi arabia which back the deposed imam and his royalist supporter and egypt 's gamal abdel nasser who support the new republic
nasser 's vision of a united arab nation free of western domination and sterile monarchy resonate across the arab world
the saudi monarchy wary of this republican fever on its border decide it be not go to stand on the sideline
the kingdom use all available mean to try to check nasser 's ambition but it do not send troop
by some estimate egypt send as many as 55,000 troop to yemen some of whom become involve in fight well inside saudi territory while others be accuse of use chemical weapon supply by the soviet union
saudi arabia provide money and weapon to the royalist
yet neither side achieve its goal
egypt 's war with israel in 1967 lead nasser to withdraw his force but the saudis be unable to turn the tide
riyadh be eventually force to recognize yemen 's republican government
now as then riyadh see the struggle in syria as a define moment
as the leader of the sunni muslim world it perceive an opportunity to check what it see as iranian plan to encircle the kingdom with hostile shiite dominate regime
as the war have take on a more sectarian character the usually reserve foreign minister prince saud al faisal have describe assad 's onslaught against his own people as genocide and syrian land as be under occupation a clear reference to the presence of iranian and hezbollah force
it be no secret that the saudis be supply element of the syrian opposition with weapon
they all but admit as much when the prince say a few week ago that if the international community be not willing to do anything then they must allow syrians to defend themselves
the saudis will use all tool available to oust assad while take measure to ensure that the weapon they 're supply to the rebel do not fall into the hand of extremist
nevertheless follow the chemical attack on civilian near damascus last month the saudi foreign minister speak candidly about the inability of the arab nation to put a stop to assad 's campaign through force of arm add that any military effort to do so would likely involve actor outside the region
recent suggestion that the arab league should assemble a military force to check assad 's aggression do not seem viable
disagreement among the league 's member nation have prevent it from agree to even endorse a potential u.s. strike
but on monday the saudi council of ministers issue a strong statement make clear that it consider prevent another chemical attack by assad to be only a short term goal
in the long term he must be oust
saudi arabia will intensify its effort to arm the rebel and to use its medium outlet and diplomatic clout to rally support for a military strike
although the kingdom be know for use its troop sparingly it have do so judiciously in the past
riyadh do for example send troop to bahrain to show its support for the sunni regime in the face of extend mass protest
of course syria be not bahrain but neither be saudi arabia the same country that it be in the 1960 when it fail to achieve its goal in yemen
the oil rich kingdom of today wield far great influence than it do half a century ago
there be no question that it will wield that influence forcefully support the rebel with gun and diplomacy as it struggle to outmaneuver iran outflank hezbollah and oust assad
fahad nazer be a former political analyst with the saudi embassy in washington
washington the extraordinary zeal of the tea party have be a signature development during barack obama 's presidency with danger for both republicans and democrats
its white hot opposition to mr. obama see first in lawmaker town hall meeting and then in the 2010 midterm election campaign help cost democrats control of the house
it could yet help republicans hold their majority in 2014
the downside for republican leader occur when that political energy propel the party to place that make it harder to win general election and to govern
just as mitt romney struggle to avoid get drag too far right in the 2012 presidential race speaker john a. boehner struggle this week to steer his caucus away from what could be an economically and politically catastrophic government shutdown
but some republican politician display an ability to absorb the heat and reflect it back in more politically promising direction
that ' why 2016 presidential hopeful and house leader could learn from recent town meeting conduct by representative tom cole of oklahoma
mr. cole a house deputy whip and a former chief of staff for the republican national committee represent a district that vote two to one republican in the last three presidential election
since first win his southwest oklahoma seat in 2002 he have never draw less than 60 percent of the vote
what dominate his session with constituent be as one man in midwest city describe it a sense of outrage about our government
mr. cole embrace the ideological touchstone of his constituent he say he be violently opposed to the new health care law extol his national rifle association membership and note that i 've never vote for planned parenthood in my life
yet mr. cole also challenge unhappy constituent on tactic tone and spirit
if replicate effectively on capitol hill and the 2016 presidential campaign trail those three guidepost could be a path toward expand the party 's appeal
â realism
some congressional colleague indulge the illusion of the party 's most fervent activist produce legislative demand that mr. boehner simply can not meet
mr. cole do not
for constituent urge a government shutdown over the health care law he warn that it would doubly backfire by hurt local resident like the worker at nearby tinker air force base and by heap blame on republicans
a party control neither the white house nor the senate he say lack the power to reverse a white house incumbent 's foremost domestic achievement no matter how often the house vote to do so
it ' awfully hard to repeal obamacare when a guy name obama be president of the united states he say
we 're in a position to stop a lot of what he want to do
we 're not in a position to undo
on the nation 's long term budget woe he encourage constituent to refocus their concern away from emotion charge but comparatively tiny account like foreign aid and toward the vast entitlement program benefit them and their friend and neighbor
at a meeting in moore one elderly man complain about the idea of rein in social security by apply the chain consumer price index to benefit calculation
instead the man ask why do not you put that chain on the spending
that of course be exactly what the chain c.p.i. proposal would do
those thing be go to be on the table mr. cole tell him note that popular program like social security and medicare make up 60 percent of the budget
it ' pretty easy to tell people what they want to hear mr. cole say in midwest city add a barb for some of his colleague there ' a certain amount of that go on in the republican party right now at a very high level
â respect
a recurrent theme on the republican right be the illegitimacy of opponent
some accuse democrats of profit from vote fraud
others like mr. romney in his famous 47 percent remark insist that large number of democrats have grow enfeebled by reliance on government program
mr. cole sound different note
instead of deride political adversary he acknowledge their strength and grit 1

nielsen executive be not available for interview on thursday afternoon
but in a previously scheduled interview with variety the company 's senior vice president for global audience measurement eric solomon acknowledge that network be starve for a number they can publish that really represent their audience not just on tv but across all platform
once some mobile viewing be include in the rating total mr. solomon say i think it will start change the narrative that people be not watch tv show
it ' that they 're watch on different platform
because nielsen rating exist mainly for the buying and selling of tv advertising time the expansion plan do not include ad free streaming service like netflix which mainly carry previous season of show
nor do the plan initially include hulu the streaming service jointly own by the parent company of abc fox and nbc because the ad that be stream on hulu differ from the ad on tv.
but nielsen will measure online stream of show that have exactly the same ad in the same order as the tv broadcast of those show
for example people who watch scandal via abc 's stream app or time warner cable 's app would be newly count in nielsen 's tv rating
people who watch scandal via netflix or hulu would not
will somers the head of research at fox be encourage by nielsen 's plan
but like his counterpart at other network he hint at a little impatience he say fox hop nielsen can bring comprehensive and scalable multiplatform measurement service to market as quickly as possible

you 're pick him up too much
be you nurse the baby again
you will spoil her
cloth diaper
the whole reason someone invent disposable be so we would not have to deal with those
be you sure that soy formula be enough for him
he keep cry
there be nothing like the arrival of a baby to crystallize the child rearing view of everyone around a new parent especially the view of that parent 's own parent or parent in law
suddenly everyone know exactly how it should be do whatever it be
at the very least they certainly know how they do it or how they remember do it which i have always suspect be a very different thing
in this installment of the new parent old parent partnership between the booming and motherlode blog i the new parent be ask the question what ' a new parent to do when the grandparent give too much advice about the baby
if a new mother nurse when her own mother use formula or a new father carry a baby in a sling while the stroller be good enough for his dad it ' not always a simple case of different people do thing differently
when we new parent do thing differently our parent may feel judge be we reject the way we be raise
or they may have safety fear be the sling safe
be soy formula really as good as dairy
the result can range from mild discord to the kind of thing some new parent would consider unforgivable like slip a breastfed baby a bottle of formula or skip the car seat for just a short ride there be still some grandparent out there who consider their arm safe than the britax
but from the grandparent point of view why not share the lesson learn in the many year of parenting that lead to this moment their child hold their grandchild
there be nothing more frustrating than watch your sleepless son or daughter reinvent the wheel when you 're certain you could help get that baby sleep more soundly or at least more often
in fact be not that the point of new parent old parent to share that cross generational wisdom
it be but we note that it ' far far easy to take advice when those give the advice do not bring year of family baggage along and settle down in the guest room
as when we ask what you do when your child would not go to school we 're ask boomer parent who have see this through to exchange idea with motherlode parent who be in the thick of it
if you have survive the generational dispute that be so often part of the territory for new parent and grandparent please tell us how you smile nod and go your own way or manage to tell your mother to take her formula stash back to the store
and if you have be on the grandparent end and emerge with your relationship with your child and their spouse intact what be the secret to raise your child through their own entry into parenthood
please share your thought in the comment section and i will round up some of the most intriguing response and maybe a few of the best story and post them on motherlode next friday
then the follow week i will pass the baton back to my old parent colleague michael winerip
washington as the obama administration embark on a highly visible diplomatic overture to iran white house official be engage in a quiet behind the scene effort to reassure israel that they will not fall for the charm of iran 's new president by prematurely ease pressure on his government to curb its nuclear program
in private conversation with israeli official and a few public statement administration official have emphasize that they remain skeptical of iran 's intention on the nuclear program and that they will judge iran by its action not by the conciliatory word of its newly elect president hassan rouhani
in advance of his arrival in new york next week for a meeting of the united nations general assembly mr. rouhani have signal a willingness to negotiate an agreement over the future of iran 's nuclear program
but the white house 's reassurance do not prevent prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel from issue a harsh condemnation of mr. rouhani this week presage a potential showdown with president obama over how to deal with iran after a period in which the two leader appear finally to be in sync
amid news of an exchange of letter between mr. obama and mr. rouhani and fresh discussion in washington of negotiation that could lift sanction against iran mr. netanyahu 's office dismiss as medium spin a raft of statement by mr. rouhani about the peaceful goal of iran 's nuclear program and his willingness to engage in diplomacy
there be no need to be fool by the word say a lengthy israeli statement issue late thursday in response to mr. rouhani 's nbc news interview
the test be not in what rouhani say but in the deed of the iranian regime which continue to advance its nuclear program with vigor while rouhani be be interview
mr. netanyahu who have describe mr. rouhani as a wolf in sheep 's clothing have step up his longstanding campaign against iranian nuclear development in recent day and plan to make it the focus of a meeting with mr. obama in washington on sept. 30 and a speech to the general assembly the next day
while american official have repeatedly tell their israeli counterpart that they would be cautious in their dealing with the iranian president the white house have also make clear that it have an obligation to test whether mr. rouhani 's expression of interest in diplomacy be genuine
we certainly recognize and appreciate israel 's significant concern about iran give the threat that have be make against israel and the outrageous comment that have come out of iran for many year about israel benjamin j. rhodes a deputy national security adviser tell reporter on friday preview the message that mr. obama will deliver to the united nations next tuesday a week earlier than mr. netanyahu
there ' not an open ended window for diplomacy mr. rhodes say
but we do believe there be time and space for diplomacy
washington and jerusalem both want to keep iran from obtain a nuclear weapon but have often disagree on the timetable and strategy for do so
israel which see a nuclear iran as a dire threat to its existence have press for a more forceful military threat
the united states while stress that all option be on the table have urge israel to give diplomacy and sanction more time
mr. rouhani 's election have clearly intrigue the white house
senior official say that unlike his predecessor mahmoud ahmadinejad he seem to have the authority from iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei to negotiate on the nuclear issue
he also have a broad political mandate in iran official say
it ' certainly different perspective look at the same picture say dore gold president of the jerusalem center for public affairs and a former netanyahu aide

israel be clearly focused on iranian action and the message in washington seem more hopeful about iranian intention
since mr. netanyahu 's united nations speech last year lay out his red line on iran and especially since mr. obama 's visit to israel in march the two country have seem in alignment
but many israeli leader and analyst saw mr. obama 's zigzag response to syria 's use of chemical weapon as a bad oman for his resolve in stop iran 1 2 next page

for its part the taxi and limousine commission offer ride in the taxi of tomorrow a model of which have just arrive at kennedy airport from a plant in mexico
the cab a nissan nv 200 schedule to be release next month have be the subject of lawsuit one from a group of fleet owner who argue that the city can not mandate the use of a single model
anyone who be tall would certainly wish to mandate this vehicle
as i experience when i drive around with the city 's taxi commissioner david s. yassky on wednesday afternoon the car have so much leg room that a person 6 foot 3 inch tall could sit comfortably on a trip from midtown manhattan to jones beach with two surfboard and a spaniel
the commission 's more significant legacy though be sure to be the introduction of its green cab approximately 200 of which have be visible in upper manhattan and in the other borough since last month
paint the color of granny smith apple the cab be livery that can be hail
previously this practice have be verboten
i do not want to be give the arecibo guy a ticket for take you home from bam mr. yassky refer to a brooklyn car service explain
the innovation of the green cab which have meter be mean to help solve the problem of an unequal distribution of taxi in the city with so many concentrate in lower manhattan and midtown and so few available elsewhere
its ancillary effect be a marginal disruption of the feudal system that bring enormous wealth to owner of yellow taxi fleet in possession of medallion that now cost more than $ 1 million apiece as driver themselves struggle to make any sort of reasonable living
the price of a permit for a green cab be $ 1,500 for three year make it possible for driver themselves to own them and ultimately profit from any appreciation
in july ebony davila who have be a livery driver in the bronx for several year receive her permit for a green cab
she begin drive it on sept. 5 and within 10 day she have cover the cost of her permit and some additional fee she tell me
increase passenger volume have mean that she have be make more money than she do in the past she can still take flat fee dispatch call through a service but her experience indicate how difficult the life of a driver in new york remain the mother of a 9-year old son she clear about $ 840 a week after fee and leasing cost put in 10-hour day mondays through thursdays and work between 5 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the weekend
one morning last week i accompany ms. davila as she drive on east fordham road toward the grand concourse in the bronx and through washington heights and other quadrant of upper manhattan
on the west side green cab driver be limit to pick up passenger north of 110th street and on the east side to the area north of 96th street midmorning activity be minimal
in the two hour i spend with ms. davila she pick up one passenger in morningside heights who be go to east 72nd street
green cab in some sense offer another lens into the vast difference between manhattan and so much of the rest of the city
do business in the bronx be particularly challenging ms. davila tell me in part because so few customer have credit card and because so many be accustomed to negotiate flat fee for livery service
this have leave ms. davila to focus her effort in harlem the area around columbia university and inwood where she have do well
in manhattan people love the meter ms. davila tell me
in the bronx they run from the meter
a few day earlier ms. davila have pick up a woman in westchester square in the bronx who go to burnside avenue
the 12-minute ride cost $ 21.50 but the woman refuse to pay more than $ 11 because that be the cost she have be use to
other passenger have cry when they have hear their fare ms. davila say
at one point when i be with her a yellow cab driver pull up next to ms. davila and start to chat express enthusiasm for the green cab movement
yellow cab driver talk to her all the time now she say often tell her that some day her medallion will be worth ten of thousand of dollar
she obviously hop so
i 'm a single parent she say
this be my future

dublin ryanair the budget airline base in dublin promise on friday to transform its abrupt culture in a bid to win customer acknowledge for the first time that a reputation for treat its passenger badly may have become a problem
the irish airline say it would overhaul the way it communicate and be more lenient about fine for luggage size
we should try to eliminate thing that unnecessarily irritate people michael o'leary ryanair 's chief executive say at the company 's annual meeting after several shareholder complain about the impact of customer service on sale
he say the airline would overhaul its web site set up a new team to respond to e mail and stop fin customer whose carry on baggage exceed maximum size by a few millimeter
a lot of those customer service element do not cost a lot of money mr. o'leary say
it ' something we be committed to address over the come year
while ryanair 's focus on cost cutting have help it to grow it fly more schedule international passenger last year than any other airline shareholder say the company 's reputation for poor customer service be limit its room for growth
i have see people cry at boarding gate say owen o'reilly a shareholder
there be simply something wrong there that need to be address
mr. o'leary who for year have play down such complaint cite statistic about revenue growth and on time departure nod as other shareholder tell anecdote about be verbally attack at dinner party
i be very happy to take the blame or responsibility if we have a macho or abrupt culture he say
some of that may well be my own personal character deformity
mr. o'leary say he be personally irritated that some ryanair employee fin customer when their carry on baggage be slightly above the maximum size

london p.g. wodehouse write in his light hearted mood would have enjoy tell the story of sir albert richardson whose possession be sell this week at christie 's
the collector 's pursuit of 18th- and 19th century decorative art that once grace the aristocratic residence of britain be recount in a preface to christie 's catalog by his grandson simon houfe
richardson who die in 1964 have belong to a generation of stiff upper lipped britons uninclined to compromise
life at avenue house be spartan he would not allow electricity or modern convenience in the house and only with great reluctance tolerate the telephone mr. houfe muse
richardson be an extremist in traditionalism
to quote mr. houfe the family shiver in the winter and swelter in the summer make it extremely difficult to keep staff
bedfordshire the county where avenue house be locate in the small town of ampthill get chilly in the winter
the architectural practice that richardson run at the back of his house presumably account for his love of well structured furniture
column be a recur feature in the piece that the collector seek out whether in a pair of demi lune console make around 1800 that bring â£9,375 or about $ 15,000 or in the pediment of an octagonal table design by the famous george bullock which rise to â£73,875
but what truly rouse richardson be read the history of the past by trace its object to those who make them or commission them
a pair of george iii perfume burner in the shape of white marble urn with ormolu gilt bronze fitting must have overjoy the collector
the perfume burner be so close to a sketch in matthew boulton 's pattern book that they can be safely recognize as the work of the pre eminent english manufacturer of objets de luxe in the 18th century in the word of adrian hume sayer one of the author of the catalog
orlando rock the international head of decorative art at christie 's point out in an interview by telephone that when richardson acquire the perfume burner in 1933 little attention be give to boulton 's work
its true significance only come to light when sir nicholas goodison publish his book matthew boulton in 2002
speak before the sale mr. rock place the perfume burner among the top lot
yet on tuesday the pair fetch â£91,875 not even half of what another pair of boulton 's perfume burner cost last december
true this pair which make â£157,250 at christie 's london come from the collection of the princess mary the sister of george vi princess royal countess of harewood
the french louis xvi style that inspire boulton have be gradually fall out of favor in the last two decade and the price difference largely reflect the premium pay nowadays for a glitzy provenance
in a striking contrast a george iii dining room pedestal cautiously attribute to thomas chippendale more than triple the high estimate when it go up to â£112,275
the design be in the same neoclassical vein as the louis xvi style perfume burner credit to boulton
but the pedestal have a lot more go for it
the figural motif be the work of a supremely accomplish albeit anonymous sculptor
better the laugh ram 's head project from the corner and the frowning mask carve halfway up the side have an expressiveness that give the piece of furniture a surrealist twist attune to current taste
what ' more the inside metallic fitting which have be preserve instead of make room for shelf to transform the pedestal into a pier cabinet make it a museum piece
sadly few among the item amass by richardson benefit from such advantage and the sale have its ups and down
a set of six georgian armchair from the 1780 closely follow french louis xvi model cost â£20,000 miss the low estimate by a wide margin 1 2 next page

editor note append nine day before easter in 2012 the rev. teresa macbain send a letter to the congregant she have pastored for three year at a methodist church in tallahassee fla.
for much of that time she have preach the gospel every sunday only to slip each monday into tormented doubt
finally she realize her faith crisis be over
she no longer believe in god
the daughter of a minister the product of a divinity school the enthusiastic evangelist do the lord 's will she tell her follower that she be resign her pulpit
her first public comment a few day before she step down as minister sound brash as she tell a convention of atheist that she would gladly burn in hell with them
deeper inside however she feel more sorrow than triumph more exile than liberation
after i step away from my ministry i literally step off the cliff ms. macbain 45 recall in a recent interview
i do not know what life would be like without a church
i be depressed
i be out there in limbo all at once
there be no community
there be no social network
the majority of friendship be go
there be no place i can go every week where i know people and they know me
now 18 month into a new life ms. macbain be bring much of her old one to the task of build congregation of nonbeliever
she have be hire as the director of the humanist community project at harvard with the mandate to travel the country help atomize group of atheist agnostic humanist and freethinker replicate the communal structure and support that organize religion provide to its faithful
this line of work draw directly on ms. macbain 's experience of see her father create and build congregation throughout the small town south and of her own track record of minister in church prison nursing home and drug rehab center
be she not help to develop community of nonbeliever she would be call in christian parlance a church planter
in her insistence on recognize the social value of religion rather than merely disparage it as superstition for sap ms. macbain operate very much in sync with her bos greg m. epstein the humanist chaplain at harvard
in his 2009 book good without god and in a subsequent 50-city speak tour mr. epstein espouse the creation of secular community
by hire ms. macbain he have put nonbelieving boot on the ground
the purpose of these community mr. epstein write in an e mail be to help us connect with one another more deeply to spur us to act in the interest of the common good and to change the way we think about value and purpose in a world where traditional religion be no longer vital for us
we 're not try to build antireligious group the intention be more to answer question about alienation isolation economic justice and political and environmental sustainability fight back against religious privilege only when necessary
everything in her life prepare ms. macbain for such a role
she grow up a pk a preacher 's kid and savor the role
she tag along with her father on hospital visit
she go with him to class at bible college
she sing in the youth choir and teach sunday school
she also strain to accept the theology of her father 's baptist faith which reserve the ministry for man
for me the lesson be that doubt be sinful and wrong she say
if you have these thing come up you suppress them you ignore them you pray them away
this natural inquisitiveness and questioning be just wrong
and if i do them i be displease god
for me life be about be the person who love god and want to be everything god want me to be
that just carry me on through decade
grow into adulthood however ms. macbain run aground on what seem like irreconcilable message in scripture
in first corinthians alone for example verse 14:34 instruct woman to be silent in church while verse 11:5 refer to woman pray and prophesy
if text be divinely inerrant as ms. macbain have be teach how could both statement be true
she try to solve her dilemma and answer god 's call by become a pastor in the more theologically liberal methodist church in the early 2000s
yet despite her sense of purpose in aid the needy despite her professional pride in a well prepared sermon her doubt never subside
they ultimately lead her to write that letter just before easter 2012
an atheist would never believe in providence so let 's just say that by very welcome coincidence ms. macbain find herself speak at the american humanist association convention one month later with mr. epstein in the audience
after she finish her address use the character in the wizard of oz as example of how to build community he approach her
i can not believe you just say those thing she recall his have tell her
i 've be work on them for 10 year
then he describe the humanist community at harvard which be previously unknown to her
he be in the process of raise its annual budget to $ 500,000 from $ 28,000
and his immediate goal be to hire a point person to assist nascent congregation of nonbeliever
seven week ago move from tallahassee to cambridge ms. macbain become that person
without know it at first she say of herself and mr. epstein we be on the same page see the desire of people atheist humanist nonbeliever who want to connect into a community and do not know how
within the free thought world the secular world it ' desire but the resource to build it have not be there

although her resume say she earn a master of divinity degree from duke university she now acknowledge that she receive no degree from duke
the column also misstate the timing of her first public comment about her atheism

he be wear dark long sleeved shirt in all of the photo which be take by video camera in the restaurant and in the hotel
in one image he appear to be wear glass
the police say it be not clear whether he be actually disabled or whether the wheelchair be in effect merely a disguise
either way it apparently let him reach for a purse that have be carefully stow under the bar at nobu 57
and on friday customer there and hotel guest at the marriott marquis be intrigue by what they consider his creative and brazen modus operandi
how could he do that ask miriam ngom an advertising manager from paris who be look at e mail as she sit on a bench in the lobby of the marriott marquis with its glass wall elevator and atriumlike layout

the man have roll in close to ask a question at the long onyx and walnut bar say the restaurateur drew nieporent who operate nobu
i guess that ' when he make the move he say
the woman do not have the purse on the back of the chair that ' problematic we warn people about that
but in front down under the bar
mr. nieporent say the man do not order anything
i think it be quick he say
he size up the place see what he need and get out of there
still when a reporter strike up a conversation on friday about the theft one woman at the bar lift her purse off the empty bar stool next to her and place it in her lap
another woman marvel at how the suspect must have maneuver on his way in and out
if somebody come near me in a wheelchair the first thing i do be grab my purse so it would not get run over say a woman at the bar at nobu 57 on friday afternoon between call and text message on her two cellphone

but late at night everyone 's drunk
they wo not notice

stratford upon avon england visitors to shakespeare county raceway during the annual yanks weekend could be forgive for think they have stumble into a regular sunday meet at a typical american dragstrip be it not for the british accent and license plate that is and the track name ' incongruous association with the playwright bear a few mile down the road
among the racecars present last spring be some hallmark of americana include a 71 chevrolet camaro call the bootlegger and a 57 bel air with honky tonkin'â letter on its door
a show n shine event feature dozen more detroit product restore to original condition and park amid tent and camper on the grassy ground of a former royal air force base in warwickshire
even in this setting which emphatically favor speed over style norman dawood 's 1949 cadillac series 62 club coupe draw a crowd of admirer
i have other classic car say mr. dawood who own such quintessentially british automobile as a 1966 aston martin db6 and a 1963 rolls royce silver cloud iii.
but no other car get anything like the look that this one get
when mr. dawood a londoner who run a translating and subtitling business saw the black fastback on ebay list by a seller in new jersey he buy it without hesitation
with characteristic understatement mr. dawood admit that the car be a bit of an impulse purchase
like many fan of the big american car that british enthusiast call yank tanks mr. dawood be particularly draw to cadillacs from 1949 which be the second model year to feature the auto industry 's pioneering foray into tailfin
discreet compare with the tower appendage that arrive a decade later the fin have be inspire by a clandestine look at the lockheed p-38 lightning a fighter plane with twin tail give to general motors designer work on the 48 model
it be the 49s however that be first to be fit with a new 331-cubic inch overhead valve v-8 which become a standard bearer for g.m. the engine 's considerable power can still be feel on the highway where mr. dawood 's car easily keep up with the flow of modern traffic
mr. dawood 's club coupe also know as a sedanette lack power steering but have several option include a hydra matic transmission which add $ 174 to the 1949 sticker price of $ 2,966 as well as power window and seat
befit a cadillac it be fit with the modern convenience of its day include a cigar light multiple ashtray and enough headroom for a driver to wear his fedora
it be impractical to keep a behemoth 49 cadillac in london where compact car ply narrow road so mr. dawood store it here about 100 mile to the northwest
that it be a sunny day so uncharacteristic of a british spring when he drive it to the yanks weekend be fortunate as the driver 's window be stick open its power lift mechanism have give out
the window malfunction be emblematic of a series of small problem some potentially incapacitating that plague mr. dawood 's cadillac and indeed many of the american classic increasingly buy on the internet by british collector
the american car scene in the u.k. be just grow and grow because of the internet say john pryor president of the national association of street clubs a co sponsor of yanks weekend
more people be buy classic american car now because they can fix them more easily and we 're now see dedicated shop open up here say mr. pryor who recently trade in his 1959 vauxhall victor for a 56 chevy
while the cadillac be en route from the united states mr. dawood find a copy of a british magazine classic american
i could not believe my eye he say
on the cover be a car identical to the one i would just bought belong to some scottish earl
the article be about a guy who specialize in restore american car and i think this be brilliant
how lucky i be to find someone who already know all about this exact one?'â 1 2 next page
cherry jones be one of the great stage actress of her generation
though she be probably best know for her emmy win portrayal of president allison taylor on 24 watch her on television be nothing like watch her in the theater her sweep unconstrained by a camera
jones win her first tony award for her role in the 1995 revival of the heiress base on the henry james novel washington square
her transformation from the diminished daughter of a cruel father to an expert in cruelty herself be a master class in voice and movement
her second tony come a decade later for john patrick shanley 's pulitzer prize win doubt
her sister aloysius the nun who suspect a priest of sexually molest a boy be as terrifying as you would expect it be her humanity that surprised
now jones be back on broadway as amanda wingfield a frantic single mother whose husband abandon the family year earlier in tennessee williams 's glass menagerie
zachary quinto play her alienated son tom celia keenan bolger be laura his disabled pathologically shy sister and brian j. smith be jim laura 's gentleman caller
both jones and the production direct by john tiffany receive raf earlier this year at the american repertory theater in cambridge mass.
it will open at the booth theater on sept. 26
last month i talk with jones a tennessee native in her greenwich village apartment before the company reassemble for rehearsal
it be a sunday afternoon and she wear jean and no makeup
for serious actress there be no great challenge than master amanda 's complexity her desperation over her daughter 's future her frustration with her son 's disaffection her obsessive reverie of the past
it seem the perfect place to begin
alex witchel
be amanda wingfield a character familiar to you
cherry jones
she be nothing like the southern lady i grow up with
i find her almost freakish compare to the southern woman i know
a.w. how so
c.j. i grow up with a creative practical english teach mother and i find amanda to be kind of abhorrent to tell you the truth
and the play be so depressing
this be where it get embarrassing because clearly i lack the depth and experience to appreciate the play for the masterpiece it be and the woman for who she be because now i have nothing but respect for amanda wingfield
john tiffany talk me into do a reading of it and afterward i just as we say in paris tenn. squeal like a pig under a gate
i realize what an extraordinary gift it would be to get to play her
a.w. you would see the play before
c.j. i have see glass more time than i think i have see any play and of course the reason be not because i want to but because all my friend or actress i greatly admire be play amanda
my not want to play her have more to do with the fact that i just do not think i be capable of it
i do not think in cambridge i come close
i gain over the course of the last three year since my parent die a good deal of weight
so when i find myself about to begin glass menagerie i once again attempt to quit smoking and i gain even more weight
i feel because of the extra weight i make her almost too aunty like
oh i should not be say any of this
a.w. why not
c.j.
well because this be for me to work on the next few week and month and not to be talk about
i guess i be try to say it will be interesting now that i have shed a few stone to see how that affect my playing of amanda
i think it will and i sha not say another word on that subject
a.w. i read that as a lead lady you also lead the company and that you do it well
you have be know to blast the soundtrack of patton to get everyone motivate before a show
c.j.
i use to do that to get me go occasionally
i always think of myself as be part of the ensemble
but because i be now usually the old and usually have the leading role i guess that add up to be the lead lady of the ensemble
this thing about age be so heavenly with these kid because celia zach brian and i be extremely close
we fall on one another like puppy in a box from the moment the four of us get together
as we know the glass menagerie be one of the most intimate quartet in dramatic literature
they make me feel like a dear friend but occasionally they will write to me and say dear mama and it ' be a treasure for me as a childless lesbian at this point in my career to have this relationship with them
a.w. tell me your ritual once performance start 1 2 3 4 5

for a couple of year now i have receive e mail from complete stranger solicit my opinion on deeply private matter
the content of these query vary widely but there be always telltale sign they be almost always write by nonnative english speaker they all claim as this one attempt to be important and they always describe a conundrum solicit my direction on what to do
the first time i receive such an e mail i assume it be a mistake and ignore it
i ignore the next few e mail as well but i begin to wonder if someone be play a prank on me
the e mail keep come sporadically and without any hint of a setup or any sign of a punch line
eventually i discover the explanation
my surname mufti be an arabic word mean one who give a fatwa
in islam the prescribed path to salvation the shariah be really know only to god
muftis be scholar task with decipher god 's will on a give matter from the ancient and profound to the modern and rather mundane which insurance plan to choose what financial investment to make
about 500 year ago i be tell some of my ancestor be employ as mufti in the court of a muslim emperor in south asia
though i be bear in the american midwest and mostly attend american school my name remain a vestigial marker of my ancestor profession
i google mufti one day and scroll through the result a wikipedia entry a few dictionary definition and a web site with a parade of man in tight pant and flashy sunglass from a kitschy indian designer
the link to my personal web site sit at the top of the second page of result
i be the first flesh and blood mufti if only in name you encounter if you be desperate enough to be look for one on the internet
this e mail with the pushy subject line be unlike any other i have receive
my friend who live in sweden want to get marry to a swedish woman it begin in latinized urdu
but this marriage will be a fake marriage
tahir the sender explain that his friend be already marry to a woman in pakistan but want to marry a swedish woman to obtain swedish citizenship
tahir 's friend want him to deliver fake pakistani divorce paper by forge both his and his wife 's signature
oblivious to the forgery the swedes would allow tahir 's friend to marry put the secret bigamist on a path to swedish citizenship and all that it offer
i doubt that either of the woman be privy to the elaborate scheme
it be tahir 's heedlessly narrow question at the end that surprise me the most
if i forge the signature on the divorce paper will that really mean my friend will be divorce from his wife
it be this small rather arcane detail about god 's view of the marital bond that nag his conscience not the various international and domestic law and criminal code that he would break
would you do me a favor and resolve this problem
the fate of several man and woman scatter across the world be thrust into my hand
the only thing i know for certain be that this would not be a victimless crime
so for the first time ever i begin type out a response to such an e mail my first fatwa
i list the law that tahir would break and the people he would hurt if he go through with his friend 's scheme
do n't do it i write
but then i delete it all
this be not a fatwa
tahir 's question be specific as it should be in a fatwa request
stray from this would just expose me as an impostor a novice mufti a hack
so i try again
yes i write out in latinized urdu
if you sign all these paper and send them to your friend in sweden this will actually lead to a divorce in the eye of allah
allah do not differentiate between real and forge divorce paper
i feel my heart pound terrify at the ease of my lie and their power to steer the course of others life
as my finger hover over the send button i feel something tighten around me and like tahir i be paralyze by the decision in front of me
i save the message in my draft folder where it sit today
i wish there be someone out there anybody who could tell me what i should do
for the first time ever i feel the need for a fatwa

be it ethical to buy something at a yard sale or a flea market at the seller 's asking price if you know the value of the item to be significantly high than what be be ask
let 's say for example someone be sell an old comic book worth thousand of dollar but ask for only a quarter because he or she do not know the true value
be it incumbent on the seller to do his or her research
if the seller do not be it fair game
ryan atlas boston
the operative word in your question be true directly place before the word value
you suggest the true value of a specific comic book be a few thousand dollar but all that mean be someone may be willing to pay that much for it base on extrinsic quality rarity for example
to the person run the flea market the true value of the comic book be virtually nothing
there be no true value for any object it ' always a construct provisionally define by a capricious market and the locality of the transaction
thing cost what they be be sell for and they 're worth whatever the seller can get
it ' unethical for a seller to knowingly take advantage of someone 's practical desperation in a crisis say sell d battery for $ 75 a pack during a citywide blackout but it ' not unethical for a buyer to accept whatever arbitrary value a seller place on his or her good
look at it like this let 's say the person at the flea market be sell that same rare comic for $ 2,000
you however would be willing to pay far more than that because of its sentimental value and the status it will bring among your comic book collect peer you would gladly fork over $ 5,000
would you feel the need to inform the seller you know i would actually pay you $ 3,000 more than what you 're ask
i do not think you would and no one would expect you to
now this do not mean it ' ethical to take advantage of people simply because they 're uninformed about the arcane detail of modern commerce
if you 're visit an elderly neighbor and notice he ' use a 1909 honus wagner baseball card as a bookmark for his bible you can not casually offer to buy the card for $ 1 in the hope that he wo not know any better
you can not proactively look for way to swindle people
but thing change when somebody decide to put a nonessential item on the market the person look at an object create an imaginary value for what it be worth and ask for the equivalent of that fabricate value in currency
if the number be too high no one will buy it if the number be too low the seller leave money on the table
but people do not inherently deserve the maximum potential price for whatever they 're try to move
if that ' what they desire they have to get it for themselves
e mail query to ethicist@nytimes.com or send them to the ethicist the new york times magazine 620 eighth avenue new york n.y. 10018 and include a daytime phone number
in 1904 the cooper underwear company run a magazine ad announce a new product for bachelor
in the before photo a man avert his eye from the camera as if embarrassed he have lose all the button on his undershirt and have safety pin its flap together
in the after photo a virile gentleman sport a handlebar mustache smoke a cigar and wear a bachelor undershirt stretchy enough to be pull over the head
no safety pin no button no needle no thread run the slogan aim at man with no wife and no sewing skill
someone in the u.s. navy must have see the logic in this because the following year the quartermaster 's office specify that sailor should wear undershirt with no button under their uniform soon thousand of man become acquaint with the comfort of the cotton pullover
though the cooper underwear company popularize the crew neck shirt they do not invent the style
the shirt evolve out of the long john that man wear in the 19th century when a number of garment maker experiment with method that would allow the fabric to stretch over the head and then snap back into shape
in the 1890 the cotton pullover still look like underwear to most people and wear it in public be consider scandalous
lawmaker in havana go so far as to ban the public display of any underwearlike top and so laborer have to toil in the heat wear long sleeve shirt with button
but gradually the crew neck catch on
in 1920 the garment be reborn under another name thanks partly to f. scott fitzgerald
accord to the oxford english dictionary the author be the first to use the word t shirt in print it appear in the novel this side of paradise in a list of accouterment that a character carry with him to board school
fitzgerald seem to have assume that the idea of a t shirt so name presumably because of the shirt 's shape would be familiar to reader and that they would associate it with the white flannel bareheaded youth of new england prep school
by the 1940 t shirt have become ubiquitous in high school
a newspaper columnist name nancy pepper write that teenager own closet full of t shirt and customize them with sew on patch and fringe
she report that some high school boy even use their t shirt to advertise that they be available for make out session around the neckline of their shirt the boy inscribe the word neck here
zz top jacques van gool be the owner of backstage auctions an online auction house that specialize in rock memorabilia
do you sell a lot of t shirt
yes t shirt have become legitimate collector item
i will never forget when jennifer aniston put on an mc5 shirt
do you suddenly see a jump in sale or auction price when that happen
absolutely
keep in mind it ' not unusual to see a 1970s shirt for as little as $ 25
but you also find them for $ 1,000
some of the most desirable shirt to collect be shirt that be exclusively make by the promoter for the staff that be work a specific concert
let 's say the academy of music in new york in 1974 have a show with alice cooper and the promoter print up 30 shirt just for the staff
obviously that shirt be valuable
what be the most you have ever get for a t shirt
around $ 1,500
that be an original fillmore west shirt that be wear by a band member of frank zappa
and it come with unquestionableâ provenance because he ' wear the shirt on one of frank zappa 's album
i assume you collect a few of your own
i have a zz top 1975 crew shirt that i love
be it valuable to you because of the memory
that shirt specifically
no
i buy it as part of a collection
as for the shirt with memory for me i have old kiss t shirt that i be partial to because kiss be the band that get me into collect back in the 70
anything else we should know about t shirt collecting
i be fascinate by how we have supersized our society
a large t shirt in 1970 seem really small now
everybody be skinny and shirt be tight back then
the garment industry have change the size almost every 10 year
the shirt be wide and longer now
when we do our auction we always make sure that we specify the dimension
you measure a shirt from pit to pit and from the top of the collar to the bottom
and we have to let our customer know the true size because they could buy a large and end up with something tiny
dip into the comment the american text genre of the moment and you can sense the current that move american life
the comment be where the real america be someone once write in a comment thread
comment also may be the most obnoxious development of the web the wild back alley where people sound their acid yawps
their tenor be now so bad that last november a game designer shane liesegang set up a twitter feed @avoidcomment where he tweet thing like i once show a comment section to a man in reno just to watch him cry
he now have 27,000 follower
when we complain about comment i have notice we do so as if we 're deal with some emanation of human nature or the lusty democratic energy of the american soul
but when i go dig into the history of the web to find out where online comment really come from it ' clear that they 're the consequence of what be technically feasible at a certain point and how that feasibility be subsequently implement
we tend to think that comment represent the culture but in fact the distinct culture of comment grow out of digital constraint
give what web user have to work with comment be bind to get weedy
comment as we know them line of text stack atop one another in chronological order be direct descendant of bulletin board system or b.b.s. which date to the 1970 user could dial in with a modem and contribute to discussion forum
the computer code that determine the order in which text appear on a b.b.s. also provide the basic architecture of the comment thread
that code or script become the basis for an early commenting function call the guest book a place for simple text entry in which any visitor could type a note
guest book be attach to the web site as a whole not to any specific content on it
this create confusion about the sort of opportunity that the guest book present
be it the soapbox of the online world
or be it a bathroom wall
fray.com a popular web site start in 1996 which use freeware guest book script be among the first to harness the potential of the guest book
a question would be pose and answer contribute by reader would be publish in real time
the web site be essentially a collection of guest book each one with a prompt and the reply be all stand alone contribution adrift in a sea of other people who be speak to themselves
it ' difficult to give credit for the invention of comment as we now understand them to one specific person or site
an interactive book travel with samantha which allow reader to submit comment via a form much as modern comment be win a best of the web award for document design in 1994 which be the same year that a consortium of world wide web developer create w3 interactive talk to discuss technical matter on which discussion point be submit by a form that make them part of a topic page
there be compete claim about the first blog to offer comment
one pioneer be bruce ableson who create open diary in 1998 an internet journaling project that allow diarist to respond to one another 's entry

the first comment there arrive on oct. 5 1998 too bad coder can not be like rock star and get their money for nothing and their chick for free
as the web evolve the simple top to bottom arrangement of autonomous line of text have a huge influence on the culture of comment and it now feel as natural as have sidewalk on two side of the street
but the typical web page present a hierarchy
at the top be the article post video or image while the comment dangle underneath like suckerfish from an indifferent shark
have the comment at the bottom of the page people feel that they feel they 're not as legitimate a voice as the original post say travis nichols who moderate a poetry foundation blog for several year and draw on this experience to write a novel the more you ignore me whose belligerent narrator take over a cooking web site with a venomous lament
commenters show up with an immediate grudge nichols observe they know they have be relegate to the steerage class of the public discourse
as a result commenters become territorial
when we have to be more aggressive in delete comment that violate our comment policy say bill adee the chicago tribune 's vice president of digital operation i get far more complaint about delete comment than i do about the level of discourse

the global elite 's favorite strongman jeffrey gettleman describe rwanda 's president paul kagame as authoritarian and repressive
but as someone who have study collective trauma in rwanda i believe that kagame 's policy be a psychologically valid response to the challenge of rebuild the social fabric of rwanda post genocide
it be a basic principle of trauma psychology that for people to deal with past event they must feel safe in the present
kagame 's social policy have create a sense of security that will make it possible for rwanda to move forward
carl auerbach professor ferkauf graduate school of psychology at yeshiva university new york
for those of us who live in rwanda it be puzzling to see others call kagame a dictator
how do an oppressive regime lift more than one million people out of poverty in less than five year
how do kagame ensure universal health insurance and primary education make the country one of the safe and clean in the world create one of the most business friendly environment on the continent and enable an average g.d.p. growth of 8 percent for the past five year

western leader talk about stop the next rwanda in syria but what about stop the rwanda in congo
it ' difficult for kagame to credibly negotiate for territory within the boundary of congo

if hall of fame starter be suppose to be durable dominant winner then andy pettitte just miss the cut
but he pitch a long time and win a lot and that make him an indelible yankee great
i 've have the success that i have have because of so many great player that have be around me pettitte say friday in announce that this would be his final season
do i feel like i have dominate this sport as a pitcher
no i do n't
every outing for me i feel like have be an absolute grind to tell you the truth
when i look at lineup and team that i be face it seem like every hitter 's hit .300 off of me you know
it be vintage pettitte the moment in his news conference when you smile and laugh a little because you know the sincerity behind the self deprecation
it be mostly true too
not only do pettitte never pitch a no hitter but he also never pitch a one- or a two hitter
opponent bat .270 off him
the league average over his career .264
pettitte have easy day like all good pitcher but not many
his self evaluation be accurate
what separate pettitte be the way he keep push himself to find a way out of trouble pull that cap down and fight
he know that the bad punishment he could give himself would be to disappoint his teammate an unpardonable sin
we laugh at him because he ' always yell at himself and talk to himself on the mound derek jeter say friday
it ' fun watch him beat himself up because he expect to be perfect
nobody ' perfect but he have those expectation and that ' the reason why he ' have so much success
it be fitting that pettitte 's most impressive statistic be his win percentage .627 at 103 game over .500
win and loss be often out of a pitcher 's control as more and more young pitcher recognize
if they work seven inning allow two run and lose they understand they have still do a good job
pettitte never believe that
it be comical indeed to listen to him berate himself after such game know that have the offense score a few more run his outlook would have be so different
pettitte accept all the responsibility as he do in 2008 for his use of human growth hormone the blot on an otherwise sterling reputation
i know my heart and i will tell you i have never try to cheat this game pettitte say friday
pettitte retire once before for the 2011 season
he say friday that he would have stay retire have general manager brian cashman not call him the next spring
he intend to pitch only in 2012 but when he lose most of that season to a break leg he come back
all along he say he have know this would be it
he let another retire yankee mariano rivera have the spotlight all season in every city and say he plan to retire with a simple announcement the day after the season
over lunch with rivera in toronto this week pettitte decide to make the announcement now
it ' great rivera say
it ' give him a chance to say thanks to the fan
bar a miracle playoff berth pettitte will pitch his final home game as a yankee on sunday when the team honor rivera
jorge posada last play in 2011 choke up by his locker after the playoff finale
only jeter will remain from the title team of more than a decade ago assume he pick up his player option as he have say he intend to do
it ' be a long hard year say pettitte 41 who be 10 10 with a 3.93 earn run average
i can not be happy with my decision
i have be retire and i know what it ' go to be like
it ' awesome and i love it
jeter who turn 40 in june have never seem tempt by retirement
he come up in 1995 like pettitte rivera and posada but unlike them he have no wife or child
baseball may not be his entire life but it be all he let the public see and he have make no concession to age
if jeter 's ankle bother him this winter as he prepare for the season you have to wonder if he would put himself through another year like this which he have describe as a nightmare
it be not in jeter 's nature to want a gauzy farewell tour and it ' no fun for him to be a figure of sympathy
jeter rightly say that it be unrealistic to ever expect another foursome of long term mostly one team star to reach the major together
you always need to have an influx of young player come in and help organization he say
that ' how we be able to be successful and i think that ' how any organization can continue or maintain success throughout the year
the yankees however do not appear to have any star on the immediate horizon
if they do those player would have be among the 56 to suit up for the team this season
compound the problem be the team 's goal to reduce its bloated payroll
rivera and pettitte clear salary by leave and in some way that help
but mostly they leave an organization at a point of deep uncertainty content with their decision and secure in their legacy

it just feel right pettitte say
i just feel like my time here be do
my run ' over
moscow russia 's federal security service announce on friday that it have seize a greenpeace international ship and its crew after a series of protest at an offshore oil rig in the arctic ocean and that it would tow the ship to port in murmansk to conduct an investigation
the seizure of the ship on thursday night which be carry out by armed border guard drop by helicopter threaten to escalate into a diplomatic confrontation since the crew include citizen of several country include one american
russia 's ministry of foreign affairs have already issue a protest to the dutch ambassador because the ship the arctic sunrise be register in the netherlands and greenpeace international be base there
the federal security service which oversee russia 's border guard say in a statement that the ship have be seize under law govern russia 's exclusive economic zone and that its activity would be report to the country 's investigative committee for possible criminal charge
the committee 's regional branch in a separate statement say it be consider charge of piracy
the ship be seize in international water near the prirazlomnaya platform in the pechora sea not far from the island of novaya zemlya
the platform own by the state control energy giant gazprom be the first offshore oil rig in the arctic
it be complete last year and be expect to begin pump oil next spring
greenpeace have send its ship to the area last month to protest what it consider to be the risk of drilling for oil in such an environmentally fragile and largely unspoiled region
on wednesday two of the ship 's activist manage to scale the rig and be detain prompt the initial russian diplomatic protest
the border troop have also fire several warning shot during protest but no one be injure during the storming of the ship on thursday night accord to the security service and greenpeace
even so the head of the organization 's arctic oil campaign ben ayliffe say the seizure be unprecedented
we have no idea why they 're be hold he say of the ship 's crew
be they be charge
why be they detain our ship in international water
the security service say 27 people be on board include 4 russians
greenpeace say the crew total 30
the reason for the discrepancy be not immediately clear
greenpeace official in moscow who have monitor the ship 's activity from a war room in the organization 's office say there have be no contact with the crew since thursday night and no official response from the authorities beyond the security service 's statement on friday confirm the seizure
accord to greenpeace at its current speed under tow the ship will arrive in murmansk on monday
before communication be sever the activist have report that the troop who board the ship behave quite correctly but bureaucratically the soviet way say vladimir chuprov a leader of greenpeace russia
in its statement the security service know by the initial f.s.b. say a search of the ship have uncover a large collection of photographic and video equipment and small boat suggest unauthorized activity against russia 's national security though it do not explain the significance of the discovery
what the f.s.b. be do now be not to protect the national interest mr. chuprov say in an interview in the organization 's moscow office
instead he add refer to major energy company now explore the possibility of an energy boom in the arctic the threat to the national interest be in the office of gazprom rosneft shell bp or whatever
for the past 12 year since his laud esther story peter orner have be engage in a strange quiet and wonderful experiment
he have write four work of fiction two novel and two story collection all compose of canny snippet that build with subtle accumulative power to create book autobiographical in feel if not necessarily in fact
in all but his first novel the second coming of mavala shikongo the book return to the same character from startle vantage point orner be write in spiral move restlessly out to embody imagine character but always return to the chicago and fall river mass. family of his most frequent first person narrator a young man who be roughly his age
in each of his book orner 's crystalline sentence and his ability to pay close and sustain attention to small moment transform the ordinary element of each story into an even more astonishing whole
last car over the sagamore bridge orner 's new collection be compose of 52 story most no longer than a few page
there be many strand run through the weave of this book one be a series feature the above mention family another be a group of italicize first person story another imagines people outside of the central character/narrator 's experience like a woman who sell television antenna in a mexico city plaza and a serbian woman sit in a coffee shop
yet another strand observe famous people mary todd lincoln richard j. daley ted kennedy geraldo rivera and isaac babel one of many writer with whom orner be in conversation
chekhov be another clear influence as be the evan s. connell of mr. bridge and mrs. bridge novel write in the same episodic manner orner favor
at his strong orner can nail interior monologue in a way that recall grace paley
just listen to the voice of walt kaplan a character who also appear in esther story and in the novel love and shame and love would my head be a head of lettuce
i drive the last car over the sagamore bridge before the state police close it off
the cape cod canal all atempest beneath
no car come no car go
the bridge cable flap like rubber band
you think in certain circumstance a few thousand foot of bridge be not a thousand mile
a writer who keep return to the same subject run a big risk
the reader can feel like an invisible observer in a room wall with mirror watch the author fascinate by the endless reflection of himself
just when you think he ' finish examine this interesting feature here it be again from a different angle
when orner return too often to the same beat or idea he can almost reverse the effect of his true gift which be the ability to take element we have see before the historical character the suburb the tight knit jewish family chicago and by the force of his fascination make them thrillingly strange
this talent never fail orner yet when he look too often at the same loss or character or mood he teeter on the verge of return the strange back to the familiar
where would we be though without writer who take great risk
they be the interesting one to follow from book to book
sometimes the risky writer stumble in his funambulist guise and you wonder if he ' about to dive into the drink
in last car over the sagamore bridge orner be especially daring with structure
though the collection be organize into four loose section base on what i interpret as loss murder longing and what remain after loss it ' difficult to understand why these story have to appear in the same book
the leap from historical character to internal narrative to apparent transcription make a reader a little dizzy
most great story collection jesus son by denis johnson twilight of the superheroes by deborah eisenberg variety of disturbance by lydia davis contain story that feel as if they must be together through character thematic refraction or just a barely detectable urgency
they develop subtle argument from beginning to end
though every story in last car over the sagamore bridge be excellent incisive move
the collection as a whole never quite coheres there be 52 passionate argument be make in the 52 story but a person come to orner for the first time may feel that each story be mostly argue with itself
luckily there be other way of read story collection than in a single linear sweep
a reader could dip into this book anywhere go for a walk and come back later to be move differently
or a reader could and perhaps should also read the collection as an integral part of a much great whole one still expand and contracting and coiling inward a living and breathing project that be evolve in a way that uncannily mimic memory or life itself
lauren groff be the author most recently of the novel arcadia

you read she be a real woman you could tell by the way she do not have to move her head from side to side to take in sound
and so you add regal bearing to the picture you see of miss vicks and loosely an era the late 50
the 60
early 70s time and place form as you read along and then come a phrase that make the form stutter
it ' after dinner when the blue green light of the scow those slow move herald of melancholy would begin to appear in the night sky
scow
be not that a type of boat a barge of some sort
scows in the sky
but now the dog be sniff around one of the tree the way dog do so you think to yourself maybe scow be another word for blimp like the goodyear blimp that pass over your street in the early 1960 and you feel the melancholy you experience as a 10-year old girl sit on your front porch on a summer night read message the blimp flash along its side that have nothing and everything to do with you
and miss vicks feel her childhood too feel all the miss vickses that have ever be layer inside her like tree ring around heartwood
the chapter be call body-â­without soul the book be call duplex and you have live in a duplex so you think
oh i know what this book be about
there be parent who drink highball and play canasta as darkness well up and the firefly come out
there be kid name eddie mary carol roy who wear t shirt and plaid short trade card and sticker they keep in cigar box play ball in the street and when a car come speed toward them with headlight blaze the kid yell head up and scatter
now the year be fix in your head
it ' 1966 for sure
the only difference be the kid on your street yell car
and then you read this the car be expensive and silver gray and drive by the sorcerer body without soul
and you find out not only do miss vicks know him they be romantically involved and he can make thing vanish or vibrate at unprecedented frequency include her private he can sow fear inside anything and then you read that he can fit his entire hand inside her
time stutter
what
his entire hand what
you read the phrase four time try to catch up the way you try to catch up when you be a kid and henry the teenager from next door tell a bunch of you a story about his finger and a girl
finger
girl
what
then a flood of understanding horrify you sham and excite you trail you back into the house to the kitchen where dinner be ready where your chicken potpie be wait to be pierce with your fork and you star at it
oh
a scow be not a blimp
real woman mean something else entirely
and though he drive a car and his name turn out to be walter the sorcerer be not a real man
he look at the street but he do not see the kid he see it crawl with soul like the earth with worm
it be no secret that even the lowly of the unruly uncontainable being live there could partake of love 's mystery and his envious rage know no bound
the real and the unreal be laminate so tightly in duplex you find yourself suddenly lose you do not know where or when this book take place you do not know what this book be about at all
and that be how it take you in
when i finish duplex i have the unshakable feeling that i would only read half of the book and the other half be still in there and if i want to finish it i would need to read it again
i be not wrong
by then i would fall in love with davis 's writing what it do to me that combination of horror and excitement that spill out of the book into my past into the now into everything around me
the novel be pack with ordinary thing tuna casserole skinned knee hot water heater red barrette and extraordinary thing robot the size of needle dactilo port in restroom those fly scow and then there be thing that fall somewhere in between the word aquanaut a purse shape thing call a mary bean that can drift across the ocean to other continent a convent name after a girl who be roast on a brazier 1 2 next page
lynda barry be a writer cartoonist and assistant professor of interdisciplinary creativity at the university of wisconsin madison
in the national consciousness harlem have usually be define by two era the artistic and cultural explosion of the 1920s know as the harlem renaissance and the drug fuel devastation that begin in the 1950 and peak in the late 80
the harlem renaissance have be well document by its poet novelist and essayist as well as by a legion of scholar in the decade since
the long depressing ghetto year be recount most eloquently by james baldwin and by less mortal like sociologist memoirists politician hollywood screenwriter and rapper
today 's white harlem of multimillion-â­dollar brownstone and flashy eatery be already the subject of book blog and innumerable magazine travel article
in her book harlem nocturne women artists and progressive politics during world war ii farah jasmine griffin a professor at columbia university delve into a largely underexplored aspect of harlem 's rich history the year just before during and immediately after world war ii a period of optimism creativity and turmoil
moreover griffin use the life of three female artist the choreographer and dancer pearl primus the writer ann petry and the composer and pianist mary lou williams as signpost through an era in a work that paint the great generation in a much less flattering light than do the usual jingoistic account
griffin 's narrative encompass the war and the second great migration of black to the north from the south
she also highlight two movement that will be less familiar to contemporary reader the double v or double victory campaign in which black americans fight
overseas for their country but also to be recognize as citizen at home and the popular front initiative conceive by the communist party in response to the economic crisis of the great depression and the rise of fascism
for black people griffin write of double v the war provide an opportunity to accelerate their demand for equality

black americans highlight the distance between this ideal of america and the reality of ongoing racial inequality often through the black press and civil right organization
the popular front meanwhile focus on culture as an especially important forum for educate and mobilize audience in support of an antifascist agenda
although by 1939 its official end have come the idea of it would continue throughout the war year
without popular front venue like cafe society or publication such as pm a leftist newspaper it be doubtful that petry primus and williams could have meet with such success
griffin argue that her three main subject consistently confront the darkness of our nation 's soul
they be critical of white supremacy and the excess of american capitalism
yet their art and their activism also denote a firm belief in the transformative nature of social change
none of these woman be native new yorkers
primus be bear in trinidad and as a child relocate with her family to the city where she be expose to afro caribbean dance the innovation of martha graham and the sweaty swing style popular at the savoy ballroom

time have not be kind to the white woman who participate in the harlem renaissance
as philanthropist and activist author and patron they seek a place for themselves in that remarkable outpouring of african american art during the 1920s and 30
some constrain by social expectation efface the record of their work
others make it difficult for historian to treat them with much seriousness

miss anne the dismissive collective name give to white woman make bit appearance in the literature of the era as a dilettante or imperious patron later she ' depict as a thrill seek slummer
always she lurk in the shadow of her male counterpart in scholarly study of the movement
but she be there encourage writer underwrite cultural institution support progressive political cause
and many lead harlem renaissance figure include langston hughes alain locke and nella larsen have reason to be grateful to her
at least for a while
like everything else about miss anne those relationship get complicated
in this remarkable work of historical recovery carla kaplan author of zora neale hurston a life in letters do well by a group of woman who get so much wrong
she resurrect miss anne as a cultural figure and explore the messy contradiction of her life move her from the periphery of a story about white patronage and boundary test interracial liaison to the center
with a focus on six of the roughly 60 white woman active in the harlem renaissance kaplan delineate miss anne as a counterpart to the better know flapper or new woman of the roaring twenties
but this be really a collection of individual story a group biography that let the idiosyncrasy of the individual woman shine through
negrotarians as the writer and anthropologist zora neale hurston call harlem 's white patron be a diverse crew full of good intention startle blind spot and astonishing self confidence
miss anne in harlem give just pass attention to the era 's quiet patron like mary white ovington a founder of the n.a.a.c.p. or the philanthropist amy â­spingarn
kaplan 's eye be on the woman who raise more complicated question about racial self identity
so we meet cunard a self appoint expert on african-â­american life who organize and self publish a massive 855-page anthology negro an entirely documentary record of the race even though she would make only brief trip to america and have never be to africa
and we encounter charlotte osgood mason an imperious anti semite and collector of african art who demand that her harlem protege call her godmother
it would be easy to dismiss such woman as high handed interloper
but kaplan urge us to take them seriously and to use their sometimes overwrought even outrageous expression of cross racial solidarity as a way to understand a broad set of question about racial identity
the book be full of fresh discovery
â­kaplan learn that lillian wood author of the radical 1920s anti lynching novel let my people go be actually white not black as other scholar have imagine
she reveal that josephine cogdell schuyler the white daughter of a klan member and the wife of the african american journalist george schuyler collaborate anonymously on much of her husband 's work and use several pseudonym to write for his journal convey the false impression of a community of white woman who share her anti racist view
but the focus of the book remain squarely on the large issue of racial identity raise by miss anne 's deep personal identification with african american life
miss anne want to suggest that race be a construct ideal yet she stumble over the internal contradiction of her impulse
she fight against racial essentialism and the perverse logic of america 's one drop rule which proclaim that even a trace of african heritage make one black but she also celebrate the seem vitality and distinctiveness of black culture
josephine cogdell schuyler write in her diary the night before her wedding to my mind the white race the anglo saxon especially be spiritually deplete
america must mate with the negro to save herself
in a similar expression of romantic racialism the philanthropist charlotte osgood mason laud the creative impulse throb in the african race
as kaplan suggest white man could sometimes get away with idea like this a dose of black culture offer a useful inoculation against the debilitating sterility of the industrial world
but white woman who seek an intimate connection with african-â­american life be see as traitor to the race even sexual deviant 1 2 next page

like most serious american novel about war the woman who lose her soul want to explain the country in its entirety
of course that ' a tall order but bob shacochis do not lack for ambition his novel be about not one but two contemporary war both of them endless the war on terror and the war on drug
it ' a novel about the united states that take place largely outside the united states if you discount the many scene set on various world renowned american golf course
although the book strive to paint a full portrait of its panoply of complicated character both in warrior mode and on the home front the problem with endless war in a narrative be that the writer end up not with war and peace but with war and
more war
one follow from battle to battle from firefight to firefight from political assassination to terror attack to revenge taking without resolution because the endless war can conceive of no resolution resolution which make a narrative complete be not part of this story
the woman who lose her soul open in the chaotic corrupt landscape of haiti in the 1990 an unpredictable place more or less run as it still be in part by u.n. peacekeeper
this be a country shacochis know well he cover america 's 1994 intervention and occupation and write about it in his intelligent nonfiction book the immaculate invasion which show real sensitivity and sympathy to soldier as well as an understanding of how haiti work and do not work
those quality serve him again in the woman who lose her soul
as usual in western novel set there haiti provide shacochis with a torrid primitive dangerous backdrop for the shenanigan of white people

it turn out she ' not just an ethnobotanist
she be also the daughter of the man who for all intent and purpose run the world
this woman who lose her soul be a male fantasy an object of male regard and unlike the novel 's big male character she be see from within only while she ' a teenager and on a few other discrete occasion
you would imagine the novel could not help founder on the shoal of this gilded pornographic creature yet the world shacochis present be believable enough and important enough to allow the book to sail on over the annoyance of the fantastical siren at its heart
i can not reveal the strange contortion jackie go through or the level of be and nothingness she experience without spoil some of the book 's many denouement
but suffice it to say that as you become more enmeshed in this paranoid and persuasive presentation of the world we live in jackie or dottie or renee become slowly more human less a goddess in spite of her almost mythic travail
in fact it ' a man 's world shacochis delineate and it ' probably fair that he turn his heroine into a man 's fantasy of what constitute female power

any time polanski be in the news geimer be once again throw back into relive her invaded girlhood an unwilling principal player in a story never satisfactorily conclude
and polanski be in the news often since the artistically impressive oscar win polish french director who make chinatown rosemary 's baby and the pianist flee the united states in 1978 before final sentencing
the wrath of american justice affront as much by his defiance as by his crime await him if he ever return
it ' a story that have become grimy with symbolism about hollywood privilege 1970s california indulgence imperfect parenting judicial pandering and inconsistency torture creative temperament and the right of rape victim

it ' also an exercise that use autobiography as a feminist tactic for geimer to own her sexuality acknowledge her crummy but eventually better lifestyle choice in the year after the rape and cash in on her right to tell the story her way
polanski cash in on his in 1984 with his autobiography roman
the credit go to newman i be guess for establish the lively pugnacious narrative voice one that manage to sound simultaneously like a provocative kid geimer 's first impression of polanski ew there ' this guy who ' like my size and sort of look like a ferret and a wised up adult there come a time when you need to let it go unless you do not want to

lisa schwarzbaum a former critic at entertainment weekly be a freelance writer
julian barnes have disregard the conventional boundary between literary genre for as long as he ' be publish book
so it should come as no surprise that levels of life a putative grief memoir about the loss of his wife the literary agent pat kavanagh be part history part meditative essay and part fictionalized biography
the piece combine to form a fascinating discourse on love and sorrow
each of the three essay the sin of height on the level and the loss of depth begin with the same concept that of put together two thing that have not be put together before
in the first essay the 19th century photographer and inventor gaspard felix tournachon later know simply as nadar combine photography and aeronautics as the first aerial photographer
in the second essay barnes narrate an imaginary affair between the actress sarah bernhardt and fred burnaby an english traveler and adventurer
in the third essay love unite barnes and his wife and persist even after kavanagh 's death
a series of coincidence link the three essay
burnaby and bernhardt also ride in balloon nadar photograph bernhardt several time nadar be a devoted husband despite his many affair and he nurse his wife in her last illness as barnes nurse his
element from the book 's first two section reappear as metaphor in the third you feel absurd like one of those dress mannequin surround by skull that nadar photograph in the catacombs
or like that boa constrictor belong to bernhardt which take to swallow sofa cushion and have to be shoot dead
but the fact of barnes 's life without kavanagh do not need metaphor
i look at my key ring which use to be hers it hold only two key one to the front door of the house and one to the back gate of the cemetery he write
i use to rub oil into her back because her skin dry easily now i rub oil into the dry oak of her grave marker
kavanagh do not appear until the last of the three essay
she cast a shadow over the playful and digressive preliminary chapter and in this new low light they seem a defense against grief 's identity warp madness as if barnes worry that write about the death of the beloved may kill her all over again this time in prose
the third essay bracingly precise be the emotional center of the book
barnes here be simultaneously wise funny and devastating when you change your make of car you suddenly notice how many other car of the same sort there be on the road
they register in a way they never do before
when you be widowed you suddenly notice all the widow and widower come towards you

when he see his congolese postman move to a new route for the first time after kavanagh 's death and must explain that she be go he observe i be think even as i be speak now i be have to do it all again in french
during a late night cab ride home barnes 's driver ask your wife be asleep will she
after a silent choke i give the only reply i could find
i hope so memoir be often accuse of be the most indulgent literary genre and the first two essay intellectually and imaginatively rigorous provide a kind of apology for the third
but despite all expectation those two be the one that occasionally wax sentimental the dialogue between burnaby and bernhardt can blush somewhat purple
in the third essay barnes refer to the dangerous lure of grief 's self pity isolationism world scorn an egotistical exceptionalism all aspect of vanity
his articulation of his anguish be well serve by his leeriness as the book 's last section be one of the least indulgent account of mourn i have ever read
i almost wish
levels of life consist only of its 56 shattering page

they be warmhearted and strikingly perceptive about their hero feeling the petty as well as the generous
but their painstaking rendering of childhood and adolescent struggle feel at moment overly wide eyed almost twee
his third at the bottom of everything be far more sophisticated
dolnick have retain his strength his sensitive gauge for emotional state and his empathy but his writing be more taut more piquant not only observant but wry in its depiction of human fallibility
the result be a lively often funny book about be young and smart and confused fumble through life in a middle class american sort of way
there be tragedy here too but it be dress in such ordinary clothes that it feel less like tragedy as we be used to it in art and more like the heartbreak we know from experience the kind that come from have the misfortune to care about other people

adam also come to love mr. and mrs. pell who be warm and sophisticated more intellectual than his mother and stepfather
mr. pell read his english paper mrs. pell listen to adam more attentively than any adult ever have
dolnick be particularly skilled at render the texture of these relationship which be at once ordinary and vitally important to the people involve
since then thomas 's life have take a turn for the bad
he drop out of college and spend the better part of the next few year lie on his parent couch before take off for india
his e mail to his parent be sporadic and increasingly unhinged
after their chance meeting at the drugstore mrs. pell step up her e mail to adam
she say thomas be drown
she write i 'm ask you to care
he never have another friend like you
i think he may still say you 're his best friend even now
adam ignore her
he be not a monster he ' just a regular guy consume by his own problem a breakup that lead him to spend far too much time on facebook torture by his ex 's chirpy status update his failure to launch a career
at 26 he note dryly no one want to know now what i want to be they want to know what i do
what he do be work as a tutor which seem along with be a nanny to be one of the loophole people my age have discover in the professional world
in the context of his professional and romantic misstep adam start to take on a blandly sympathetic everyman quality but the book regain its footing once its focus return to the pells
it turn out adam and thomas share a secret something they do that have horrific consequence for another person
at the bottom of everything be essentially a book about guilt specifically the kind that result from a small mistake whose reverberation be disproportionately large
this secret prove after a while to be too much for adam and thomas 's friendship

but lace as it be with a tortured strain of self denial as rare in secular american culture as that red himalayan panda hardy 's story may seem appealing and comprehensible only to those who have be raise in conservative christian church

yet while she have good reason to erupt at the bad theology at one point she receive a patronizing e mail from a bishop tell her she should repent for go on vacation with an unmarried man because he suspect sin have transpire when it do not the memoir can read uncomfortably like a string of tantrum

greg tobin have write several book about the american west include the novel prairie
virtually everything worthwhile write about american poverty be essentially about moral failure
it be the failure of the society accord to liberal or of the poor themselves accord to conservative or of institution and individual together in a complex combination accord to centrist
poverty violate core american value
it challenge the american dream 's promise of prosperity for anyone who work hard a faith central to the national ethic
richard wright call this faith the truth of the power of the wish
the dream die in the early page of sasha abramsky 's intricate study the american way of poverty

abramsky a freelance journalist who have write for the nation the atlantic and other publication regard inequality as a social control mechanism support by financial interest belief in the desirability of oligarchy
he endorse the notion popular on the left that poverty be not just a glitch but a feature of the american system a corrosive brew he write capable of eat away at the underpinnings of democratic life itself
his observant reporting be less doctrinaire than these grand assertion
he travel the united states meet the poor whose wrench tale he insert in tight vignette among data drive analysis and acute dissection of government program
the country he portray be damage by indifference at high level his american hero be not in congress or boardroom but be rescue here and there by care citizen at the grass root their inventive program achieve small success
abramsky present himself as an heir to michael harrington whose book the other america publish in 1962 awaken part of the political establishment to the shadow of poverty beneath the country 's gleam affluence
but that work come during the civil right movement which be already sensitize americans to social injustice
fifty one year later injustice do not readily incite outrage
this be so even as million of middle class americans in free fall during the economic collapse that begin around 2008 have have a taste of what it mean to be poor
the absence of a strong movement for change be striking especially give the diversity abramsky find as he map the landscape of poverty
there be people with no high school education who be poor he write but there be also university graduate on food bank line
there be people who be poor because they have make bad choice get addicted to drug burn bridge with friend and family and then there be people who have never take a drug in their life who have huge social network and who still can not make end meet
the destitute include those who have never hold down a job and others who hold down multiple but always low-â­pay job frequently for some of the most powerful corporation on earth
there be the chronically poor child whose only hot meal be what they be give at school and the newly poor who have lose the middle class comfort of huge suburban house and expensive car
many of these people 's wound be intimate and invisible to outsider

lorenza and jorge caro live in a storage room in new mexico regularly run out of propane during the winter and rely on herb and tylenol for medical treatment
a 40-year old mother in california lay off from her job have reach the lifetime limit for welfare and so be deny benefit after she have a new baby she become homeless and her old son have to quit college to support her
a hawaii woman name emily could never free herself from the legacy of a family rack by alcoholism and violence
what should we do abramsky ask with someone like emily
his answer be not to blame the victim and he skewer conservative for do so
whether poverty be cause by dysfunction or the dysfunction be itself a product of the poverty or as be likely the dysfunction and the poverty interact in ever more complex feedback loop for the large community to wash its hand of the problem represent an extraordinary failure of the moral imagination

no open house no advertising and not a single online photo
and yet a $ 27 million town house on the upper east side and an $ 850,000 two bedroom co op in lower manhattan have no problem find buyer in the past six month
neither home be list on the open market
off market deal know as whisper listing have long be the purview of the ultra high end market
certain property often with price tag of $ 20 million or more be shop with a shroud of mystery among a small circle of well connect agent instead of be put on the market for the world to see
now this hush hush approach have spread to many price point include apartment below $ 1 million as seller realize the advantage they have thanks to the lack of apartment available for sale in manhattan
seller feel cocky
seller feel like they have the ball say brian k. lewis an associate broker at halstead property who in the last six month have take on seven whisper listing from client who do not want to list their apartment but be willing to entertain offer
these range from a two bedroom for $ 1.295 million on the upper west side to a downtown loft for $ 12 million
in an improve economy with no inventory they have the asset people want
the number of apartment for sale in manhattan at the end of august be at its low level in at least 13 year accord to miller samuel the appraisal firm
the shortage have force real estate agent to use aggressive tactic to drum up inventory from troll through expired listing in the hope of revive a dead deal to send letter to owner in choice building to try to persuade them to sell
no one know how many property be sell through a well place word but off market tactic appear to be on the rise in major market where there be a scarcity of inventory include san francisco los angeles and miami
there ' more of it now than ever before say shaun osher the chief executive of the brokerage firm core in new york note he have a database of about 50 apartment own by people willing to sell give the right circumstance
we as broker know everything be always for sale at a price
plenty of circumstance arise in which it make sense to keep a list out of the limelight range from celebrity who do not want to read about their property transaction in the tabloid to seller who would rather not upset tenant prematurely
some seller hope to avoid the hassle involve in get a property in shape to show
others do not want a lot of people traipse through
in march for example a five bedroom town house at 12 east 76th street on the upper east side sell for $ 27 million in a whisper sale without any wear and tear to the carpet
the place trade after just three viewing
yet most brokerage firm be of two mind about off market deal
on the buy side they be largely for it
after all quietly gain access to an off market listing mean less competition in a market where open house often provoke a stampede
uncover a whisper sale by say chat up the doorman for a client unable to find something on the open market ultimately benefit that buyer
on the sell side brokerage firm tend to discourage whisper listing
for one the secretive nature of whisper listing mean some broker will inevitably be shut out of a possible deal
moreover seller hop for a quick full price sale through a whisper listing they say limit the buyer pool and thus their chance of get the high possible price
the seller be always go to be best serve by make sure the property be expose to the wide possible marketplace say frederick peters the president of warburg realty
in addition a whisper campaign can be a tall order
it ' sort of like say achieve this great price and do all of this but do not tell anybody about it say hall f. willkie the president of brown harris stevens
finally if discretion do not move the merchandise broker can end up do a lot of work for nothing
in a whisper campaign the broker frequently have no sign contract with the seller a scenario commonly refer to as a pocket listing
when there be a contract it often mandate a quiet sale
if the broker find a buyer he or she often collect both side of the commission 1 2 next page

the united nations population division say this summer that fertility rate in many develop country have not slow as the u.n. have expect
as a result it revise its forecast of the world population in 2100 upward by 700 million people to 10.9 billion
two year earlier the u.n. have make an even large revision raise the forecast from 9 billion
and in its 2008 forecast global population be set to peak around 2070 and then begin to fall
in the late forecast there be no peak in sight
what we have be find when we have look at all of the data say barney cohen the chief of the u.n. 's population study branch be that our previous projection be a little too optimistic
fertility in africa be not come down as rapidly as we think it would
africa account for nearly all the increase forecast for 2100 about 600 million and latin america account for 100 million more
the u.n. forecast for europe and north america be reduce from previous one
but it be possible that the u.n. 's late forecast be too pessimistic
an analysis of population trend by sanjeev sanyal the global strategist for deutsche bank conclude that population growth be likely to be much slow than the u.n. 's estimate

in our view global fertility will fall to the replacement rate in less than 15 year mr. sanyal write
population may keep grow for a few more decade from rise longevity but reproductively speak our specie will no longer be expand
he forecast that world population will peak in around 2055 at 8.7 billion and decline to 8 billion by the end of the century
the fertility replacement rate the number of child per woman need to keep the population level over time be usually consider to be 2.1
mr. sanyal say that in the develop world it be high because of high infant mortality and maternal death in childbirth
for the world as a whole he think the current replacement rate be about 2.27 a figure that will come down gradually over time
the spread between the late u.n. forecast and deutsche bank 's for 2100 2.8 billion people be great than the entire population of the world in 1955
developed country have long have low birthrate but the large decline in fertility be in develop country with the chinese russians koreans and brazilians no longer reproduce themselves mr. sanyal write
even if mr. sanyal turn out to be right some develop country seem likely to face explosive growth
in nigeria mr. sanyal say the fertility rate the number of child bear to an average woman during her life be about six more than four time than the rate in japan
he think that rate will come down more rapidly than the u.n. expect but still forecast that the country will have 521 million people by the end of the century an increase from about 160 million in 2010
the u.n. forecast be 914 million
the accompanying chart show the two forecast for nine major country
they agree in many way
by the end of the century both forecast see population fall in china india germany japan russia and brazil
the bank think there will also be decline in the united states and france by then while the u.n. forecast have both country continue to grow albeit at decline rate
both forecast expect the british population to have level off
there be of course no way to be sure what will happen
a major epidemic could throw all forecast off
some develop country have start campaign to raise fertility with only limited success so far
but a world with fall population in many country and with the number of people of work age decline even more rapidly could lead to major change
retirement be likely to occur later and it be at least conceivable that some country will even compete for immigrant
many country be begin to welcome skilled immigrant mr. sanyal say in an interview add that germany be increasingly open to those whose skill be not as high
mr. sanyal be skeptical about one widespread forecast that demand for health care will expand rapidly as population grow
he say many of the old people be likely to be healthy and note that with few child there will be less demand for health care from the young

new york if you do not belong to a community these day you 're really on your own
but never fear
community have become one of those word that should always have quotation mark around it
word get hijack all the time but this be one of those really violent eight country stop for refueling hijacking
actual community in which people know each other do thing for each other and act in concert may be on the decline
but new meaning of community be rush to fill the void
in u.s. government speak there ' the intelligence community which every crisis reveal to be not much of a community at all
there ' a scientific community but they quarrel over citation like toddler
there ' the european community you know how that ' go
in silicon valley there be a developer community of headphone wear techie who speak to no one and play video game alone
there ' a business community whose member seek to put each other out of business
entire race be call community however gap their internal division
the religious who always seem to be emerge from or head into a schism belong to the monolithic faith community
these new us of community be about more than semantics
they offer clue to our present day culture
they bespeak a world less tether to place than before uncomfortable with top down leadership even if still dependent on it saturate by business logic but determine to disguise the tawdriness of selling obsess with networking and also embarrassed by it
go back a century or two thanks to the corpus of historical american english database and you see rather different usage of community
the word then seem to connote a specific group of people from a particular patch of earth who know and judge and keep an eye on one another who share habit and history and memory and could at time be persuade to act as a whole on behalf of a part
people write of the community of my native city and the extensive community of swallow barn and the community of friends in barbadoes the lattermost refer to quakers
the citizen of natchez be not a play go community jonathon holt ingraham write in a travelogue through the american south in 1835
philip rochester stand well in the community natalie sumner lincoln write in a 1920 novel
a bad man be a plague spot in a community professor kenyon l. butterfield write in a 1919 work on the future of farming
in case where community be mean more abstractly it be often in reference to the political community in a democracy a group not know to each other but bind together in a solemn and real way
the republican principle demand that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affair alexander hamilton write in federalist no 71 in 1788
fast forward to today and in some arena this style of usage persists
but it compete now with a great many community that be not really community at all
what they be though be culturally tell
place and share experience have fall away from the modern understanding of community
when people speak of the medical community or the venture capital community they 're really describe people with common interest and not common value history or memory
community in this sense be less about have one another ' back more about lobby for the same thing
it ' also about networking and deal making under the cover of a word that make such endeavor sound less crass
almost every conference these day tell its attendee that it ' not really a conference but a community

i get really lucky this year she say her enormous doe eye wing in liner and her tiny body adorn in fitted black t shirt white high top and cutoff end a few inch above some righteous tan line
what a year it have be
while perform the hit of marketa irglova and glen hansard as the girl in the broadway musical

here be excerpt from their conversation
q.
so how do you land the role of the mother
a. you know it be a very roundabout way
there be not really audition for it
there be like meeting
i meet with the show 's creator craig thomas and carter bays over skype and i do not know what it be for
and then people start come to see once
it be so secretive that i be like o.k. i think i know what this be about
i read that neil patrick harris mistakenly congratulate you on the role while you be still test
have you meet him at the tonys
maybe we meet but i do not think we do because you rehearse all morning then you go to your matinee then you do hair and makeup then you do the red carpet then you sit for four hour
and you never really have a meal
i imagine it ' like get marry or something
people be hand you tequila shot and champagne
suffice it to say i do not remember much of the evening
the mother be a bass player in a band
and in once you play the piano and sing
how would you come to have an arsenal of instrument
for once i learn the piano essentially
for this i be attempt to learn bass
i mean do not ask me to play in front of anyone anytime soon
and i have always sing way longer than i have act
i just like could not get a musical to save my life
then you land once
i actually play a different role at a workshop in the beginning and the only instrument i play be the stick
john tiffany the show 's director really push for me to play this other role
we have a shorthand that be very special to me
we also can stay up and watch beyonce video all night
she ' my bomb
do beyonce ever see the show
one night i come out of my dressing room and there be secret service guy everywhere
and i get so excited
oh my god beyonce be finally here
and then it be joe biden which be awesome and he be so lovely
but beyonce never come
you know who do come and i lose my mind
liza minnelli and i just die
she come out afterward and be like oh my god your energy

i go completely silent
and now you have get a role in a scorsese film
it ' a very fun role and i be unrecognizable
i have a huge perm acrylic tip i be spray tanned and have a thick queens accent
it ' a big role
or at least i think it be
i constantly live in fear that i will show up to see it and they will have replace me with don cheadle
the set inside the cavernous studio on chelsea piers in manhattan be mean to represent the bunkerlike headquarters of a polished chinese techno gangster who have a relationship with the criminal mastermind raymond reddington now for murky reason unknown to both the gangster and the audience align with the f.b.i. reddington the main character in the come and much anticipate new nbc drama the blacklist be at this moment wear a light green short sleeved shirt and brown walk short
he look more like a u.p.s. delivery man than the scourge of american law enforcement
then again it ' only rehearsal and james spader have his reddington intensity dial down to zero in favor of his normal real life mode of free associate bonhomie
that be the quality that come through in his enthusiasm for this new star role
the possibility of this show be limitless he say excitement pitch in his voice
anybody can be on the blacklist
ha ha ha anybody
no new network drama enter the season with high expectation or more pressure than the blacklist
the show have win wide praise from critic and be the most talk about show during the last development season in hollywood
and to be blunt nbc need a hit
the network have slot it in the best spot on its schedule mondays at 10 p.m. after its top rat show
the voice
a lot be rid on this series and mr. spader 's eye catch performance
a few minute after rehearsal in a gray herringbone suit and vest hair skim close to his scalp mr. spader be in full reddington mode joust with his chinese nemesis with weary disdain deliver line of complicated dialogue with precision through 12 long take
one reason for all the repetition mr. spader 's new co star megan boone who play reddington 's foil in the series a young f.b.i. agent name liz keen be not as sure foot in the scene
of course ms. boone perhaps best know for the short live law order los angeles have not be act in movie television and theater for 35 year as mr. spader have

would you say spader be kind of an enigma ms. boone muse later in her dressing room
he ' very unexpected
he ' very kind and considerate
but then you also do not ever feel 100 percent comfortable
all of which make james spader the ideal choice for reddington a character intend to fascinate and mystify
in the opening episode to be show on monday night reddington give himself up to the f.b.i. offer to help capture a host of known and unknown supercriminals on just one condition that he work with liz keen a woman
he seemingly have have no prior connection to
even mr. spader do not want to know too much about the reason for all that
as long as the show continue to be enigmatic it have its compulsion mr. spader say
i need to know a little bit more than the viewer but i do not want to know more than that
jon bokenkamp one of the executive producer of the blacklist say that in conversation with another producer john fox they picture a keyser soze the mysterious villain of the film the usual suspects
mr. bokenkamp point out that reddington tell the f.b.i. do n't trust me
everything about me be a lie
the script for the blacklist be mr. spader say intrigue in way that get his attention
it be to be shoot in new york he note which he consider home
and then there be that character
there be he say his eye widen with delight a lot of room for me to move around in there
mr. spader have always be an actor who look to expand boundary
his career have range from memorable teenager pretty in pink to provocative bad boy sex lie and videotape to acclaim television lawyer
he win three emmy awards for play the character alan shore in two series the practice and boston legal
along the way he acquire a reputation for quirky idiosyncratic performance of eccentric character
now 53 and no longer in possession of the wavy lock that be his early signature mr. spader remain in demand for more mature quirky idiosyncratic performance
come off
boston legal mr. spader be at loose end and break he say because he spend all his television money on new household family new life and all that

movie hold little appeal either in role or compensation
then david mamet approach him about his play race slat for a broadway run
mr. spader say yes not a perfect play but a great role for me

glenwood be one of the city 's large private landlord and have a long history of building and manage rental apartment but howard and steven swarzman the grandson of leonard litwin the founder of glenwood make the decision to take on the condo project at 60 east 86thâ street
this come about because my brother steven and i want to try this model as oppose to what we have develop in the past say howard swarzman acknowledge that his grandfather have a philosophy of build high quality rental housing
but what we 're most concerned with be build the same quality housing we have always do he say whether it be for sale or rental
along with the swarzmans mr. litwin be a sponsor of the project as be several glenwood executive
while other manhattan property developer have be flock to the ultra high end condo market where apartment have recently go into contract for as much as $ 90 million apiece mr. swarzman say that be not a motivating factor for the glenwood team
the project call sixty east eighty sixth a 19-story building that will be build just east of madison avenue with 15 full floor three- or four bedroom unit will be price at about $ 7 million to $ 20 million an apartment accord to beth fisher a senior manage director of the corcoran sunshine marketing group which will be market the unit
the glenwood team mr. swarzman say have begin demolition of two exist building on east 86th a 30-foot wide town house and an adjacent walk up building both buy in march for a total of roughly $ 31 million
the condo tower should be complete by the spring of 2015 he add
a small building site and manhattan 's exorbitant land price make it impossible to do the sort of rental building with dozen of unit that glenwood typically construct even with rent at record level mr. swarzman say
sixty east eighty sixth will only be about 60,000 square foot he say rental building be typically around 300,000 square foot
clothe in fluted limestone with casement window and juliet balcony sixty east eighty sixth be be design by a collaboration of the steven b. jacobs group a previous glenwood partner and the danish architect thomas juul hansen a richard meier protegee who design the interior for pricey manhattan project like the perry street residence and one57 a tower under construction on west 57thâ street
besides the 12 single floor unit the project will have three marquee residence a duplex penthouse with a rooftop and side terrace a 10th floor duplex with two terrace and a ground floor triplex with a 36-foot by-30-foot rear garden
price will range from $ 12 million to $ 20 million
the building 's amenities will be on the basement level include a fitness room individual storage room a bicycle storage room a child 's playroom and a wine cellar
the lobby will have a sitting area a small library and a 24-hour doorman
mr. juul hansen who tend to favor classic material clean line and minimal furnishing say his goal at 60 east 86thâ street be bridge the contemporary with the traditional
obviously this be not downtown and it ' not the high line or any other neighborhood that ' sort of up and come he say
there ' a history here so what we have try to do be create a building that on the one hand be very modern clean and simple
but on the other hand be very respectful of the neighborhood and environment
elevator will open into the full floor unit arrive at a foyer that separate a private wing with bedroom and bathroom from the public room
the live room and dining area will be open and spacious with ceiling height of about 10 foot or nearly 20 foot in the duplex and the triplex
floor will be wide plank oak except in the kitchen where they will be vals quartzite
mr. juul hansen say that while the building will have large window the structure will be a far cry from a contemporary glass tower
we have beautiful window but they 're not just flat piece of glass he say
they have true divide pane that will add texture to the facade
only step away from central park the large residence be design to have broad appeal ms. fisher say but may attract family in particular perhaps those already live on the upper east side but look for new construction
ms. fisher say she could not yet reveal exact pricing for the apartment but add i think the market throughout the city have come to accept that $ 3,000 per square foot be a baseline number for a luxury condominium on the market
certainly on the upper east side right near central park

birmingham mich. even at 88 and in what may be call spectacularly frail health elaine stritch can still make a theatrical entrance
dinner be ready in the condominium just next door to the one ms. stritch herself move into last spring in this pristine detroit suburb near where she grow up and where much of her family reside
the crab cake have be bake the corn on the cob boil the spinach steam the cocktail stir
still no sign of ms. stritch
the minute tick by with a small frisson of anxiety building
the dinner 's host kim and henry hagood who have become ms. stritch 's friend since she move next door can not seem to get a response either to a phone call or a knock on the door
we all know she ' not be well lately
then with little fanfare there she be a beam smile on her face a bark command to her caretaker on her lip
she be dress with her usual ahem minimalism in black tights a detroit athletic club t shirt and not much else
except for one new and unhappy accessory a wheelchair
ms. stritch would doubtless prefer a mod string of pearl but the last several month have not be kind
before make her dramatic exit from new york to theater lover for whom ms. stritch be an ornery goddess it be as if the chrysler building itself have pick up its skirt and skip off to detroit of all preposterous place ms. stritch take a bad fall one morning while leave her longtime habitat the carlyle hotel

when ask what she ' be do to keep herself occupy the answer come quickly sleep often until 3 or 4 in the afternoon late even by the standard of showbiz folk
but she seem to relish this i 've be prepare for this nap for a long time she say
black humor have always come naturally to ms. stritch whose long career on the new york and london stage and more recently on the television series 30 rock have make her a well armored survivor

shortly after arrive in birmingham ms. stritch give an interview to the vanity fair web site in which she seem grousy and regretful
grousing have always come naturally to this scaldingly frank woman but she ' never make much of a song and dance about woulda coulda shoulda
i 'm think maybe i leave a little early grumble the woman once notorious for be the last to abandon any party
the god apparently can not take a joke because for now at least even stroll next door be out of the picture for ms. stritch
and yet perhaps because she ' be force to settle down her attitude toward her sudden bolt from the spotlight seem to be mellow
one thing i be proud of myself for do be combat those feeling she say when those profess second thought be mention
i do not want to be a sad sack who make a mistake
i gotta have a home a base a place where all my shoe be

and grill ratatouille be relatively fast to make maybe not as quick as use the microwave but tasty
all of this say grill vegetable for a ratatouille do take some finesse
the first time i try i do everything wrong
i build a very hot very high fire coat the pepper zucchini and eggplant in olive oil then plop them onto the grill only to watch my poor vegetable blaze up and burn
so the next time i take thing more slowly
i build a less intense fire and spread out the coal more evenly
i leave off the oil at least while the vegetable cook
then i hang around them sip wine and keep an eye on their various state of doneness pull off each piece as soon as it be char in spot and very tender
no one want al dente ratatouille
once everything be thoroughly cook and slightly cool i chop up the vegetable and douse them in olive oil which be as essential to good ratatouille as the eggplant and pepper
i also stir in copious amount of basil and garlic
what i get be something less stew y and more salad like than a typical ratatouille but with a concentrated flavor and velvety texture along with a garlicky kick
i serve it with herbed goat cheese and crisp toast while it be still warm then eat the cold leftover the next day with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkle of chile powder
like the original it will keep for many day in the fridge get better as it sit
grill ratatouille may not replace the other ratatouille variation in your repertory
but it ' a nice deeply flavored addition to the list
whistle blower have be big news lately from chelsea manning formerly know as pfc
bradley manning to edward j. snowden
yet for most people the question of whether to expose unethical or illegal activity at work do not make headline or involve state secret
but that do not make the problem less of a quandary
the question of when to remain quiet and when to speak out and how to do it can be extraordinarily difficult no matter what the situation
and while many think of ethic violation as confine to obviously illegal act like financial fraud or safety violation the line often can be much blurrier and therefore more difficult to navigate
accord to the ethics resource center a nonprofit research organization the no 1 misconduct observe by a third of 4,800 respondent be misuse of company time
that be closely follow by abusive behavior and lie to employee
the finding be publish in the organization 's 2011 national business ethics survey which interview on the phone or online employee in the commercial sector who be employ at least 20 hour a week
it have be conduct biannually since 1994
but offensive behavior that create a hostile work environment although often not think of as unethical behavior be the lead reason people leave their job say patricia j. harned president of the center
abusive and intimidating behavior by supervisor and manager create a toxic work environment
so do lie to employee
lester who ask that i use only his first name to avoid possible legal issue work at a global consulting company for about three year earn high performance rating
at one point he say he accidentally learn that his manager have deliberately lie to deny him a promotion opportunity
lester speak to the hiring manager to no avail and because the company have a strong ethic program include a specific no retaliation policy and a hot line to report ethic complaint he report the situation
an investigation find no wrongdoing and although lester appeal the finding no action be take against the manager
that be when he say the retaliation begin
all my direct report be take away from me and i be give the most difficult project with the least resource he say

a whole series of thing happen which be unlikely to be a coincidence
after about eight month of this he decide to leave
lester 's experience may be the reason the misconduct most often see be not the one most often report
accord to the ethics resources center report which be sponsor by major corporation like wal mart and northrop grumman less than half of those who observe a bos lie to employee report it
on the other hand while only 12 percent say they have witness someone steal from the company almost 70 percent of those who saw such activity report it
one of the difficulty in case like lester 's be that no law have be break
true whistle blow accord to stephen m. kohn a lawyer and executive director of the national whistleblowers center be when people report see or experience something at their company that be against the law rather than case in which employee feel mistreat but nothing illegal have occur
it appear however that an increase number of employee be willing to come forward in both type of case
more people be use their company ethic procedure to report misconduct and more people be file whistle blower claim
mr. kohn whose organization refer potential whistle blower to lawyer say there have be a 30 percent increase in the number of people request referral over the last 18 month which come to about 1,500 request a year
he also say the quality of complaint with more documentation and from high level employee have increase
some of this be because of legislation rewarding whistle blower for come forth and protect them against retaliation
the most prominent of those be the dodd frank act which pass in 2010
under that act the securities and exchange commission oversee the office of the whistleblower which in 2012 alone receive 3,001 tip 1 2

as the securities and exchange commission 's chief of enforcement from 2001 to 2005 the era of landmark fraud settlement with enron worldcom and tyco stephen m. cutler earn a reputation as a tough and at time fear regulator
he be particularly dismay by chief executive chief financial officer general counsel and compliance official who even if not directly implicate in wrongdoing create a culture in which it be ignore tolerate or even bad tacitly encourage
in a speech in 2004 to the general counsel roundtable he say you 've get to talk the talk and you have get to walk the walk
both be critical to maintain a good tone at the top
and he call for more accountability hold all of your manager accountable for set the right tone
that mean discipline or even fire them when they have fail to create a culture of compliance
human nature be what it be there will be those who break the rule
but if manager do not do enough to prevent those violation or let them go unaddressed for too long then they should be hold responsible even in the absence of direct involvement in those violation
how time have change
as general counsel of jpmorgan chase company mr. cutler be now on the receive end of the lecture which this week come from george s. canellos a successor to mr. cutler and currently the co chief of enforcement at the s.e.c. on thursday the s.e.c. and other regulator announce that jpmorgan have agree to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly $ 1 billion in fine for its conduct in the london whale matter in which the bank 's chief investment office lose more than $ 6 billion and bank official mislead regulator about the loss
the s.e.c. fault jpmorgan 's egregious breakdown in control and say that senior management break a cardinal rule of corporate management by fail to alert the board to the full extent of the problem
the s.e.c. do not name any of those senior manager but make reference to the chief executive who be jamie dimon
mr. cutler oversee both the legal and compliance department during those event
mr. cutler no longer oversee compliance
and the london whale affair be not jpmorgan 's only regulatory problem
the bank face multiple other regulatory action and investigation range from manipulate energy market to mortgage back security fraud to fail to disclose suspicion about the ponzi scheme operator bernard madoff to conspire to fix rate in the setting of the global benchmark interest rate informally know as libor
as the allegation have mushroom jpmorgan have go with almost dizzying speed from one of the world 's most admire bank to one taint by scandal
and all of this happen on mr. cutler 's watch
you have to say he do not run a tight enough ship say john c. coffee jr. a professor of law and expert in corporate governance at columbia university
it ' not just the london whale episode
i would not call that the crime of the century
but take with everything else the energy manipulation the mortgage fraud case the libor rigging it suggest that there be not enough investment in compliance and the general counsel be not proactive enough
he ' do a very good job at defend the firm but not enough at prevent it in the first place
a lawyer whose company be an s.e.c. target during mr. cutler 's tenure say this week i have to admit to a certain amount of schadenfreude add at the time he do a lot of grandstanding about lawyer be gatekeeper and the moral compass for the organization and how we should have prevent all this
he sound great on the soapbox
now i have be follow jpmorgan and it ' pretty ironic
this lawyer be among the many i contact who do not want to be name
i quickly realize that i be waste my time try to get people to offer unconflicted comment about mr. cutler or anyone else at the bank since a their firm represent jpmorgan b they represent someone for whom jpmorgan be pay the legal bill or c they 're try to get into category a or b. james cramer joke on cnbc 's mad money this week that jpmorgan should just buy the manhattan law firm paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison famed for its high stake litigation practice 1 2 next page

in a bold stroke diego della valle one of the great italian entrepreneur of luxury throw his hat into the fashion ring on friday during the milan fashion season
to be more precise the executive whose success be build on leather bag and shoe tap the designer alessandra facchinetti to make clothes for tod 's well design streamline tailor with a compass and ruler present a more realistic vision of clothes for summer 2014 than some of the pretty floral design that be hit the runway
i believe that we can build the clothing part of our tod 's business to 30 percent over the next five year say mr. della valle as the model in their modernist but wearable clothes stand on a podium at the show 's end
ms. facchinetti who formerly design at gucci and at valentino present a precise chic collection in which she take no risk unless you count a geometric circle dress inspire by the artist and architect of italian modernism
she cite gio ponti and lucio fontana as among her inspiration
but as befits a house build on skin the designer also use perforated leather for skirt that seem as polished and streamline as her chestnut red/brown lead color
these be clothes for real life with the white shirt part of the equation and a sense that the shoe flat or with a high heel and the bag sometimes fold into the hand really have grow as a new branch from tod 's root
that be already an achievement
and the element of craft put into apparently simple clothes as well as the modesty of the approach and the presentation suggest that this could be a fruitful collaboration
nature and especially the flower be as ever the motif of summer dressing
the importance for designer be to find a way to modernize florals to take the flower from pretty to punchy or to change its shape from tidy botanical drawing to digitally explode pattern
it ' about color and asiatic country and gray sky and different proportion say giorgio armani backstage before his emporio armani show where everything begin with watery flower that even ripple over hose to give an all over effect
the designer call his use of color and shape as poise between realism and abstraction by which he mean there be a harmonious unity about the decoration not the current shock of over sized or dramatically digitalized print
one important change apart from model walk out with hairdresser clip on their head be the silkiness of fabric use for pant that be mostly soft and often crop above the ankle or ballooning into a soft fullness
intriguingly there be only one long ankle length skirt yet it look like one of the best proportion piece in a collection that show emporio armani 's soft side
it ' the chaos theory say antonio marras refer to the word of ovid in the poem metamorphoses a book he have backstage along with the whimsical artwork of flora and fauna by the american painter kathy ruttenberg
but nature do not seem in any way chaotic in the marras collection
with violinist play in a green dell beside the improvised runway the first ensemble seem the essence of calm a black mesh sporty dress that when the model turn show another aspect equally light organza with a flower pattern billow across the back
this mix be a modernize aspect of the collection that introduce into the grove of tree not only predictable if beautiful print of flower but also element of plastic
they give a jolt of modernity to the romance that be always part of the marras aesthetic
and the blend of tailor jacket with soft skirt the dawn color and the occasional olympian vista of a pastoral landscape make for a fine collection
there be time when veronica etro seem to sink into her family 's fabric business others when she try to fight it
her show friday have a certain serenity as if she have decide that graphic florals and the company 's perennial paisley print be just right for her idea of fluid summer clothes
with just a touch of the hippy 1970 in scarf frame with fringe at the neckline and languid liquid long dress that look quite beautiful ms. etro do what be require of her make the brand look credible
there may have be more focus on a different approach to paisley and florals although there be a sudden foray into appliqued flower in hot pink
but mostly the print be just well control dress slender and wrap into shape tailor jacket in lightweight fabric to counter the more hippie look of flow skirt
altogether it be a pleasing collection for a house and a designer who be wedded to pattern and print

so much for till death do us part
for the first time more americans 50 and old be divorced than widowed and the number be grow as baby boomer live long
sociologist call them gray divorcee
barbara wingate and her husband of 34 year divorce in 2009 after the marriage of their daughter
both be 58 and they have try for a year to resolve their difference
i be in shock and seek counseling for several month say ms. wingate who live in toledo ohio
my whole identity be connect to him and his career
a half century ago only 2.8 percent of americans old than 50 be divorce
by 2000 11.8 percent be
in 2011 accord to the census bureau 's american community survey 15.4 percent be divorce and another 2.1 percent be separate
some 13.5 percent be widow
while divorce rate over all have stabilize and even inch downward the divorce rate among people 50 and old have double since 1990 accord to an analysis of census data by professor at bowling green state university in bowling green ohio
that ' especially significant because half the married population be old than 50.â
in 1990 1 in 10 person who divorce be 50 or old
by 2011 accord to the census 's american community survey more than 28 percent more than 1 in 4 who say they divorce in the previous 12 month be 50 or older.â researcher at bowling green warn that the rise divorce rate among old americans have serious implication that go well beyond the couple themselves
like widowhood divorce can contribute to economic strain and poor health place a large burden on child and give shrink family size on institutional support from government and other source
it ' still true that in general the longer you be marry the low your chance of divorce but it ' sure no guarantee anymore say stephanie coontz who teach family history at evergreen state college in washington state
she attribute the trend to the high rate of divorce among baby boomer and to the fact that many be in second or third marriage make them statistically more prone to divorce
still she and others detect an increase in divorce among couple who have be married 25 year or more
i do not necessarily think this will accelerate but i do not expect it to go down she say

stay together until death do us part be a big challenge than it use to be because we expect so much more of marriage than we do in the past and we have so many more option when a marriage do not live up to those expectation the extension of the active healthy life span be a big part of this professor coontz say
if you be a healthy 65 you can expect another pretty healthy 20 year
so with the kid go it seem more burdensome to stay in a bad relationship or even one that have grow stale
most divorce among old couple as in young one be initiate by woman
woman have long be more sensitive to or less tolerant of a mediocre relationship than man professor coontz say and so another big factor be that with their increase work experience and great sense of their own possibility they be less willing to just wait it out.'â we expect to find equality intimacy friendship fun and even passion right into what people use to see as the twilight years,'â she add
it take work
it ' not something you can put on the back burner while you raise your kid for example and think it wo not scorch somewhere along the way professor coontz say
robert d. gould a new york trial lawyer who handle matrimonial case and himself be divorce when he be over 50 say a lot of marriage die a long time ago but because of the shame involve in a family people often stick together for the child
now the child be grow up
viagra be another reason man be able to satisfy young woman
and people be live long and they can get out and still have a life
two sociologist at bowling green call it the gray divorce revolution
in a recent study of census data prof
susan l brown and prof
i
fen lin attribute the trend to several factor include societal acceptance of divorce and the increase economic autonomy of woman
finally they write lengthen life expectancy decrease the likelihood that marriage will end through death and increase the length of exposure to the risk of divorce
the professor find that divorce be more likely among old couple who have less education who be african american or hispanic and who have be marry for few than 10 year
nonetheless they say that if the rate remain constant we project a 25 percent increase in the number of people that will experience divorce two decade from now among americans 50 and old
after ms. wingate divorce she move closer to her daughter put the proceeds from the sale of her marital home in real estate and after two year begin troll internet date site for companionship

i wait in the mouth of a tunnel beneath the concrete bleacher of nebraska 's memorial stadium
rock side to side on the sol of my shoe i focus on the rhythm of my breathing and scan the stand watch them fill one red pixel at a time
a dream of mine be about to come true
i be about to take the field at a cornhuskers football game
it be a dream i conjure when i go to my first nebraska game as a preschooler rid on my father 's shoulder
one i have hold on to since first grade when i earn the nickname husker boy for my daily crayon drawing of eric crouch bobby newcombe and correll buckhalter
one i have try to visualize during a couple of week of practice that have prepare me for the performance but not the moment
instead of wear a red jersey and a white helmet the combination that make up many of my childhood halloween costume i wear overall and a jacket of wool and polyester wield a trombone in my right hand
i start play trombone in fifth grade the same year i last play organize football
that be the age i realize i be not go to be the next tommie frazier even though i wear his no
15
eight year later i go to the university of nebraska draw there not only by an urge to stay close to home and the football team whose result control my mood swing but also by the chance to be in the march band which have long ago supplant play football among my favorite pastime
my first game as a member of the band in 2010 be also taylor martinez 's first game as nebraska 's start quarterback
the announcement of his name in the starting lineup have the stadium buzz a half hour before kickoff
but sway anxiously under the bleacher i be more concerned with get through my first pregame performance mistake free
as kickoff loom ever closer i repeat my sequence of drill move in my head imagine step by step my route around the field
we have learn the routine a few week earlier in band camp a week of 14-hour day spend practice music and march on a field mold by the footprint of mike rozier and ahman green
during camp and two week of morning rehearsal after school start we spend as much time in memorial stadium as the football team would all season
and now it be showtime
when i strut onto the field for the pregame show i eye my mark on the turf and the time keeping of our conductor and try not to be overwhelm by the density of the red clad crowd surround us
later that become a difficult task
as we play the final chord of the star spangled banner i hear the roar of jet engine pass above the flyover our director have explicitly tell us not to look at so that our eye would remain on the drum major who would promptly lead us into the next phase of the performance
but i realize quickly that the noise be not above me but around me
i have mistake the rumble of the crowd 's applause for the sound of plane fly overhead
i realize just how loud 85,000 people could be and it hit me that after 18 year of observe college football from 40 row up in the stadium i be now part of the spectacle on the field
in the first quarter martinez score on his first carry a 46-yard scamper that set the tone in the huskers 49 10 victory against western kentucky
while the fan in the stadium express their glee with incoherent yelling and awkward high five we in the band have only a second or two to celebrate
then we begin play our fight song hail varsity and
there be no place like nebraska lead to the crowd 's excitedly off tempo clapping and chanting of go huskers during the brief pause in the music
they be ritual i have become accustomed to as a spectator but the change in perspective make it all a new experience
as the game continue i learn the rule that guide the band 's action
â
no sit in the bleacher when the team be on the field
â
no play music if there be a penalty flag or an injury
â
no daydreaming once a play end our focus must shift to the drum major whose hand signal tell us what to play
go be my day of idle observe of watch nebraska beat pittsburgh on a block field goal in 2005 or celebrate the huskers 300th consecutive sell out game in 2009 or root for comeback that fall short against texas in 2002 and virginia tech in 2008
the trombone become my free ticket into every game but it also make me an active participant in the game day ritual
after the game the band assemble on the field and march through a tunnel up a ramp and out of the stadium dance to drum cadence back to the campus 's music building
we pass child sit on their parent shoulder girl sport temporary tattoo of red n 's on their cheek boy wear red jersey
at that moment they may have be dream of become the next taylor martinez
but who know
maybe someday they will exchange a mouth guard for a mouthpiece and still find themselves able to be a part of the game day experience in lincoln

the aggressive tactic on display this month and last be part of a case that have generate intense public scrutiny and raise alarm about what be call article 32 proceeding which help determine whether case be send to court martial
article 32 hearing permit question not allow in civilian court and can include cross examination of witness so intense that legal expert say they frighten many victim from come forward
these have become their own trial say jonathan lurie a professor emeritus of legal history at rutgers university and the author of two book on military justice
if this be what article 32 have come to be then it be time to either get rid of it or put real restriction on the conduct during them
more broadly the case at the naval academy illuminate what critic say be wrong with try sexual assault case in the current military justice system which be under scrutiny in congress
one bill to be debate this fall sponsor by senator kirsten e. gillibrand democrat of new york would take the prosecution of sexual assault case outside a victim 's chain of command with a goal of increase the number of people who report crime without fear of retaliation
in the come week the military judge who preside over the female midshipman 's hearing will send a recommendation to the naval academy 's superintendent on how the charge should be dispose of
the superintendent vice adm. michael h. miller will ultimately decide whether to move ahead with a court martial or drop the case
increased scrutiny of the problem of sexual assault in the military combine with more reporting of attack have lead to a large jump in the number of such case that have go to court martial
the defense department say that 68 percent of sexual assault case be send to court martial last year compare with 30 percent in 2007
but those increase have be accompany by a series of controversy that have roil the system include one at lackland air force base in texas in which more than 40 female trainee be abuse by their instructor as well as the arrest in may of the director of the air force 's sexual response unit lt

sadness be an emotion we usually try to avoid
so why do we choose to listen to sad music
musicologist and philosopher have wonder about this
sad music can induce intense emotion yet the type of sadness evoke by music also seem pleasing in its own way
why
aristotle famously suggest the idea of catharsis that by overwhelm us with an undesirable emotion music or drama somehow purge us of it
but what if despite their apparent similarity sadness in the realm of artistic appreciation be not the same thing as sadness in everyday life
in a study publish this summer in the journal frontiers in psychology my colleague and i explore the idea that musical emotion encompass both the feel emotion that the music induce in the listener and the perceive emotion that the listener judge the music to express
by isolate these two overlap set of emotion and observe how they relate to each other we hop to gain a better understanding of sad music
forty four people serve as participant in our experiment
we ask them to listen to one of three musical excerpt of approximately 30 second each
the excerpt be from mikhail glinka 's la separation f minor felix blumenfeld 's sur mer g minor and enrique granados 's allegro de concierto c sharp major though the excerpt be in g major which we transpose to g minor
we be interested in the minor key because it be canonically associate with sad music and we steer clear of well know composition to avoid interference from any personal memory relate to the piece
our participant be more or less split between man and woman as well as between musician and nonmusicians though these division turn out to be immaterial to our finding
a participant would listen to an excerpt and then answer a question about his feel emotion how do you feel when listen to this music
then he would listen to a happy version of the excerpt i.e. transpose into the major key and answer the same question
next he would listen to the excerpt again in both sad and happy version each time answer a question about other listener that be design to elicit perceived emotion how would normal people feel when listen to this music
this be a slight simplification in the actual study the order in which the participant answer question about felt and perceive emotion and listen to sad and happy excerpt vary from participant to participant
our participant answer each question by rat 62 emotion relate descriptive word and phrase from happy to sad from bouncy to solemn from heroic to wistful on a scale from 0 not at all to 4 very much
we find as anticipate that feel emotion do not correspond exactly to perceive emotion
although the sad music be both perceive and feel as tragic e.g. gloomy meditative and miserable the listener do not actually feel the tragic emotion as much as they perceive it
likewise when listen to sad music the listener feel more romantic emotion e.g. fascinated dear and in love and blithe emotion e.g. merry animated and feel like dance than they perceive
something similar happen with the happy music perceive blithe emotion be rat high than their felt counterpart
in general it appear that perceive emotion may be rat high than feel emotion when it come to emotional category characteristically associate with a give key
when listen to sad music then there be a tension or slippage between the two type of emotion
how be we to understand this gap
one answer may be that in everyday life we typically experience emotion that have a direct connection to whatever object or situation give rise to them
but when we listen to sad music or watch a sad movie or read a sad novel we be inoculate from any real threat or danger that the music or movie or novel represent
if this be true what we experience when we listen to sad music may be think of as vicarious emotion
here there be no object or situation that induce emotion directly as in regular life
instead the vicarious emotion be free from the essential unpleasantness of their genuine counterpart while still draw force from the similarity between the two
we need to study vicarious emotion further

new york tough new limit on the amount of heat trap emission new power plant can emit will likely accelerate a shift away from coal fire power and toward electricity generate with natural ga wind and sunshine
power price for home business and factory may eventually rise and nuclear power could return to fashion
the rule propose by the obama administration friday will have little effect on the mix of power source and electricity price anytime soon because it only apply to new power plant and be likely to be challenge in court
even so market force be already reshape power market in the same way the rule will
a boom in natural ga production in the u.s. have dramatically increase supply send price plummet and prompt a shift away from coal
the rule require new coal plant to be build with extremely expensive equipment to reduce carbon dioxide emission
that will make coal look prohibitively expensive to regulator and utility plan for the future
by comparison natural ga fire plant which emit half as much carbon dioxide as coal plant along with wind turbine and solar panel will look like a bargain
jason bordoff director of columbia university 's center on global energy policy call the rule consistent with already evolve market trend toward the use of natural ga instead of coal and describe it as cost effective
nonetheless it create financial winner and loser
here ' how the landscape could change for company and customer
winners natural ga
most new natural ga fire power plant will stay within the rule 's emission limit without require new equipment
that mean natural ga fire plant already by far the cheap power plant to build and operate will likely remain the top choice for utility
as utility rely more on natural ga to generate electricity demand for the fuel will increase and price could rise
that would mean more revenue for domestic natural ga drillers such as exxonmobil and chesapeake energy drilling service company such as halliburton and baker hughes and pipeline company such as spectra energy and kinder morgan
it will also help maker of natural ga fire turbine such as general electric and siemens
renewable energy
wind and solar developer such as nextera energy and firstsolar may see increase demand for large project especially if power price rise
that would also help rooftop solar installers such as solar city attract more interest from home and business
nuclear power
nuclear like coal have suffer from the low power price bring on by cheap natural ga
utility have abandon ambitious plan to build new nuclear plant and they have shut down age plant that have become too expensive to run
if price rise nuclear operator such as exelon and entergy will benefit
and because the new rule make new coal plant so expensive utility afraid of rely too heavily on natural ga for future power production may turn instead to nuclear
power generator
if electricity price rise as coal use decline company that sell wholesale electric power such nrg energy and calpine may benefit
losers coal miner
the u.s. coal industry be already struggle because coal supply pile up and price drop as natural ga gain favor
u.s. production be expect to fall to a 20-year low this year and 151 mine that employ 2,658 worker be idle in the first half of this year accord to snl energy
while coal will continue to be an important fuel for electricity generation in the u.s. for decade it appear to be face a long slow decline
the country will get less and less coal from the comparatively high cost appalachian region and more from cheap to access coal deposit in the illinois basin and in wyoming
company with large appalachian operation such as james river coal and alpha natural resources will likely continue to suffer
electric customer
natural ga price generally dictate the price of all electricity in the u.s.
if demand for natural ga rise fast than drillers supply it the price will rise and drag power price up too possibly boost electric bill for home and business
in the past natural ga price have be extraordinarily volatile
industrial company who have use low power price in the u.s. as a competitive advantage be concern
the national association of manufacturers say in a statement friday that the rule will hurt competitiveness and job creation

when you can drive a car off the lot with that new car smell for a mere $ 199- or $ 299-a month lease many consumer can not help ask how can i afford not to take this deal
after all if your family be already pay for cable television and a couple of cellphone many of the current lease be offer may seem like a relative steal
and with lease fuel surprisingly strong car sale it seem that more driver be think in those term
indeed the pay as you go smartphone mentality seem to have seep into the car market especially with young buyer many of whom do not seem to mind that they do not own anything at the end of the lease 's term
but that have not change the long term economics of leasing it still cost several thousand dollar more than buy a new car not to mention a newish use car
people 's attitude be shift say philip reed senior consumer advice editor at edmunds.com
the car be be see more as a commodity to be use and then return
ownership be a big part of the world war ii generation people want to own their house and own their car
they be teach that be financially responsible
there be reason certain people may want to lease the first one be you have extra money to burn
but for the rest of us the financial consequence be worth re examining especially when you have a slew of compete financial priority like college tuition retirement or even a nice vacation
so let 's start with the hard number
mr. reed look at three way you could acquire a four door honda accord ex buy a new 2014 model lease the same 2014 car or buy a used 2011 accord with 36,000 mile
many people in the new york area be pay about $ 28,211 for the new car include tax title and registration
the analysis look at the cost over six year since the average person own a car for that long and it incorporate typical buying pattern the new accord be purchase with a five year loan the use car be finance with a four year loan and the person who be lease must take out two consecutive 36-month lease
the rest of the assumption be detail on the accompanying chart
lease initially seem to be the cheap route when you look at total out of pocket expense it cost $ 5,244 less than buy new
buy a used car be still the most economical
you save $ 5,277 compare with leasing and it ' about a whopping $ 10,500 less than buy new
but when you account for the teensy fact that you do not own anything at the end of those six year the calculus change
if you have buy the car new it would still be worth about $ 11,000 accord to edmunds.com 's calculator
the used accord would be worth around $ 5,000
so after you factor in that equity leasing cost $ 5,756 more than buy a new car and $ 10,277 more than buy use
buy new cost $ 4,521 more than buy use
leasing be the loser across the board
if you ask me what be the most expensive way to get a car the answer would be you only want to own it during its period of great depreciation and then move to another new vehicle say jeff bartlett deputy automotive editor at consumer reports
well that ' what leasing be
with that analysis in mind here be some other factor that need to be consider when decide the best way to acquire a car
needs versus want be there anything you absolutely need now that you can not get in a lightly use car that ' only a few year old
some expert say you can make a decent argument for new car base on some recent safety improvement
the insurance institute for highway safety which some expert say tend to have more rigorous guideline than the government add new recommendation after its late small frontal crash test last summer
and some manufacturer have be update their exist model mr. bartlett say to meet those standard
though it ' hard to argue that anyone need to have the late technology that have come a long way in the last couple of year too
that two- to three year time difference mean the world in term of connectivity mr. bartlett add
now there be stereo in mainstream car that offer pandora aha and stitcher for stream internet radio via a smartphone and allow you to control an ipod
plus usb connection be fast replace traditional microplugs and bluetooth be near ubiquitous
the expectation of mobile connectivity and what you can do on the run have change dramatically
leasing
it become a difficult cycle to escape
unless you save extra money while leasing you may not have accumulate enough for a down payment on your next car and you wo not have a car to trade in
and now that you 're accustomed to the low monthly payment it will be hard to stomach the much high monthly cost of buy new or even a not too old used car in some case
you will avoid repair or maintenance cost except for oil change and tire rotation that use and even new car buyer would eventually have to pay
but you will probably pay more for insurance with a lease vehicle which mr. reed say be almost as much as the extra maintenance
it end up be close to a wash
leasing also allow you to get into a car right away with little financial disruption it require little or no money down and minimal outlay each month
there ' also the fact that you 're drive a brand new car with all of the late technological and safety feature
time horizon
beyond the number your time horizon should also help determine what you ultimately decide
if you be someone who know they be go to own a car for 10 year and you be drive all over the country you be not the type of person who should be leasing say alec gutierrez a senior market analyst of automotive insight at kelley blue book refer to the mileage limit of about 12,000 a year on lease vehicle
if you go beyond that you be likely to be hit with significant penalty
besides buy a new car and hold onto it be more economical now
you be make pretty high payment for about four or five year but the dependability of car be really great these day say mr. reed
it can probably go another five year with minimal cost
lease mechanics
you 're essentially pay for the amount of value the car lose over the course of your lease in other word the price you pay be base on the vehicle 's residual value at the end of the term
consider a $ 30,000 car that be worth $ 15,000 after three year
you will divide that into monthly payment and that be your lease payment plus interest and some fee mr. reed explain
you also only pay sale tax on the amount of the vehicle that you use in this case $ 15,000
that ' why car that retain their value tend to translate into better deal for leasing the high the residual value the low the monthly payment
thing like mercedes bmw and honda hold their value very well and make very good lease car mr. reed say
if you do lease figure out the number of mile you want to drive each year how long a lease you want and how much you want to put down
then call a few different dealer and ask them to quote you a monthly payment
this be the simple way to shop around mr. reed say though leasing aficionado may choose to get more technical
buying used
if you buy used you may need to come up with a large down payment than if you buy new since more people tend to default on used car you may have to put 10 to 20 percent down on a used car compare with 0 to 10 percent for a new one
but because of the easily repossessed nature of the collateral if there be one loan that be easy to qualify for it tend to be a car loan say greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate.com
pay cash
of course there ' always the option of pay for a car the old fashioned way save up and pay cash
that ' what mr. bartlett of consumer reports do whether he be buy new or use
obviously nobody do this he say
but when you pay cash you do not have to worry about them sneak in all of these fee
you just negotiate a price and then write a check for that number
if i can put some of it on my credit card and then get the point and pay it off at the end of the month i come out ahead
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 25 2013a chart on saturday with the your money column about the cost of lease versus buy a car misstate the percentage of the purchase price of a $ 28,211 car that be represent by a down payment of $ 5,112
it be 18 percent not 20 percent
ottawa at their peak just a few year ago blackberry smartphones be symbol of corporate and political power
when president obama take office he make keep his blackberry a personal priority and when blackberry service have a hiccup so do business on wall street
but after be upstaged time and again by industry rival the device may soon remain only in memory
on friday blackberry announce that it would lay off 4,500 employee or nearly 40 percent of its already reduce work force
the cut be so deep some analyst and investor say that the company 's day as a smartphone maker be effectively over
the company also say that it expect to report a quarterly loss of nearly $ 1 billion next week mainly the result of a write off of unsold blackberry phone but also because of payment to stop manufacturer and supplier from add to the pile
and of its six phone that the company offer two will be discontinue
this be a recognition that they lose the handset war say james h. gellert the chairman and chief executive of rapid ratings an investment risk evaluation firm
it ' certainly a waving of the big white towel
the company halt the trading of its share to make the bleak announcement
it also say that revenue be expect to have be $ 1.6 billion in the second quarter almost half of the $ 3 billion analyst have anticipate
sale of phone during that time it say total 3.7 million
apple by comparison sell 31.2 million iphones during its last quarter
more alarming to many analyst be blackberry 's announcement that it have use about $ 500 million in cash to stay operating during the last quarter lower its cash holding to $ 2.6 billion
although the company have be lose market share for several year it have manage to increase its cash holding
share in the company tumble 17 percent for the day to $ 8.73 nearly all of it after trading be resume
four year ago blackberry have 51 percent of the north american smartphone market accord to the research firm gartner
but the fast change industry and in particular phone from apple and samsung leave the company behind
the rest of the smartphone world be race ahead at top speed while we have blackberry stuttering to a stop say michael gikas the senior editor for electronics at consumer reports
blackberry 's executive initially look down on the move to make smartphones into pocket size computer which be pioneer by apple 's iphone
but consumer prefer smartphones with full touch screen multiple camera and most important hundred of thousand of apps
blackberry 's device largely stay the same often with half screen and a physical keyboard and its initial attempt at touch screen phone be technological failure
in january the company introduce the blackberry 10 line of phone which be base around an entirely new operating system of the same name and offer hardware feature that be similar to device from the market leader
but the new device be unable to break the grip of apple and samsung
when the late flagship phone in the line the z30 be announce this week it cause hardly a ripple
even blackberry seem to have give up
unlike with other phone in the series the z30 release come without any kind of public or flashy demonstration
the failure of the blackberry 10 line of phone quickly lead to speculation that the company like palm before it would be break apart and perhaps gradually disappear at best linger as little more than a brand name
this summer blackberry announce that it be undertake its second strategic review in less than a year
unlike with the earlier one however blackberry 's executive do not rule out a sale of the company
all of the uncertainty surround the company several analyst say probably make the company 's problem even worse during the last quarter
corporate and government information technology department have hold back on commit to blackberry 10 phone and more important for blackberry the corporate server software that support them
consumer be often less sensitive to corporate problem
but keith lam a manage partner at red sky capital management in toronto say that carrier appear to be cut back their blackberry 10 inventory to avoid be saddle with unwanted phone and reduce display space and promotion for the device in store

from that it kind of snowball downward for blackberry say mr. lam whose firm do not manage any blackberry share
if as many expect blackberry be no longer in the handset business the question become what remain of value to a potential investor
mike lazaridis the co founder of blackberry who step down as co chief executive in 2011 have contact private equity firm about a possible bid for the troubled company
but a private company would be up against some of the large company in the world like apple
even before friday many analyst have declare blackberry 's hardware business to be worthless
there be no clear consensus however on the value of its other asset
blackberry own a secure global network that once provide it with a selling point for customer seek security
but that highly centralized network be prone to occasional failure be base on age technology and have have its role reduce under blackberry 10
the value of the company 's patent many of which it hold in partnership with other technology company be also uncertain
the layoff also suggest that blackberry will be force to give up most of its research and development work further cloud its value
the big problem be that they wo not have money for r.&d. and that ' death for a tech company say neeraj monga an analyst at veritas investment research in toronto
it ' not like coca cola which have be able to bottle the same formula for over 100 year
i be walking along a twilit hudson river the other night distract by how gob of blacken chewing gum can make a sidewalk look leopard spot when an even more vivid sight catch my eye
i saw a flutter of excitement ripple through a row of 15 or so people sit on park bench along the water
the flutter be like a seat nonstadium version of the wave and lead to isolate pocket of chitter and simulation of postcoital languor
have a squirrel 's tail just tickle a long row of human bottom
what just happen i ask a park bench sitter in her 20
she report hugh jackman just walk by
sans sunglass or hat
i express enthusiasm and ask if she have wave or say hello
she tell me no
i be cool
which be how we all try to be in the presence of the famous no
but sometimes we 're unwilling or unable to curb our less instinct we want to parse or mediate an entity that be at once wholly familiar but wholly unknown to us we want to touch the proverbial screen
be this bad manner
we 're tell as child do n't stare but every celebrity seem to wear a placard around his neck that scream please do
one day about 11 year ago the personal trainer and entrepreneur diã¨ry prudent be sit in the air france lounge at charles de gaulle airport with his 3-year old daughter when cicely tyson enter
i tell myself do n't stare,'â mr. prudent say
miss tyson make no eye contact but after a few minute of watch my daughter play patty cake with daddums she crack a smile
i know that smile
i have see sound and the autobiography of miss jane pittman
i cry every time
mr. prudent lean toward miss tyson and whisper excuse me but be you cicely tyson
miss tyson give mr. prudent a gaze that could sear beef
then she respond with a question why
before i could even think of what to say out it come why not?'â cough cough
cricket
a german shepherd chain to a fence plaintively bark
fortunately miss tyson chuckle
i blush and we both quickly go back to mind our business mr. prudent say
incident in which a nonfamous person have ground for interact with a famous person can also be fraught
matthew tynan an associate at the law firm pelosi wolf effron spates recount how a dinner party in the early 90 hold by his mother kathleen tynan a writer who have be marry to the critic kenneth tynan draw the director jonathan miller the actor dirk bogarde and princess margaret
matthew tynan say p. m. clearly enjoy slum it with her intellectual friend but i imagine that the trip down our rusty stair past the dustbin to our basement flat be a new low
press into service as coat check bus boy and waiter the teenage mr. tynan be remind by his mother to bow to the princess and call her ma'am
at one point i find myself serve a fish course to p. m. and as i lower the dish in front of her she abruptly raise her hand arrest mine mid motion
all conversation immediately stop
without look up she bark wrong side!'â as everyone watch i make a muffled apology pick up her poached salmon raise it over her head resist the urge to deposit it there and gently sit it down on the right side
mortified mr. tynan slink back to the kitchen
but when it come time to clear the fish course i notice with smug satisfaction that p. m. have not use the correct knife and i could not resist mumble something pathetic along the line of be there a problem with the fish knife ma'am
if she hear me she make no sign of it and completely ignore my presence a skill that she have surely hone after many year of interact with the servant class
it ' probably not worthwhile to generalize as to how famous people want us to behave around them
while certain comment commonly and unmaliciously direct at the illustrious be often construe by their audience as hurtful e.g. i 've be a fan of yours since i be a tiny child
i think i just read something of yours!"- many other comment fall under the gauzy heading depend on situation
tom waits may or may not be amuse to be tell that his voice be indistinguishable from cookie monster 's the singer and actress connie stevens may or may not want to know that you and your facebook friend larkily refer to asterisk as emoticonnies
but maybe not
the desire when in the presence of the famous to separate yourself from the herd by say something memorable to them be a dangerous one
as someone who once tell tina fey i have a big gay crush on you i can attest that the anxiety about a celebrity 's response to a provocative comment be not worth the ground gain by utter same provocative comment
that say miss fey seem flattered

for the second year in a row new york city ballet have ally with high fashion for its fall gala
last time the costume design be by valentino and the review of the event mostly describe it as an artistic fiasco or insignificant
i miss it
by those standard this recent program at the david h. koch theater on thursday be a vast improvement
only one part of the evening be apt to give you bad dream
in between a john adams orchestral fanfare and the finale of balanchine 's western symphony come three world premiere each with a different pairing of choreographer and fashion designer
before each piece a video peek at the collaborative process
such video often feel superfluous or pandering but these be charming find good humor in the conflict between fashion and choreography
marc happel the director of city ballet 's costume shop come off as a hero a man you would want by your side in the artistic trench
first be capricious maneuver by justin peck the city ballet soloist who have emerge in the last two year as its most exciting choreographer
the costume by prabal gurung be respectful for the three woman short dress in white black and red that move well and add color and flair
the work set to lukas foss 's capriccio be only eight minute long but it pack in plenty
this be mr. peck 's fourth piece for the company and though the influence of other choreographer be patent you would not mistake his work for anyone else 's capricious maneuver be a tightly construct garment nothing capricious about it and yet it breathe freely
the title of the adams orchestral fanfare
short ride in a fast machine could have apply to it
two man join the three woman and mr. peck shuffle two against three with great dexterity
the dancer be pattern maker but they be also young people draw together in fellowship
it ' characteristic of mr. peck that the woman be happily slide under the onstage piano and characteristic that that motif be vary to comically surprising effect
he pull a thrilling recklessness out of his cast
andrew veyette 's abandon have rarely seem so dashing
brittany pollack in a breakout performance justify her red dress
next come neverwhere by benjamin millepied the former city ballet principal recently name the director of the paris opera ballet
the costume by iris van herpen be more attention grab make of scale of black plastic that sparkle in the light
the woman 's point shoe be also boot a novel and provocative crossing of two kind of female footwear with different association of power
though crinkly the costume work fine and mr. millepied 's dance for three couple attend closely to its score drones and viola by his frequent collaborator nico muhly
though both the music and the dance be break into section silence meet with blackout it ' in fluency that choreographer and composer be well match
particularly in a late tender duet for sterling hyltin and tyler angle the endless thread typical of mr. millepied 's partnering float on mr. muhly 's drone
between the costume and the pyramid cut out of the backdrop and the dancer gathering into inward face circle neverwhere be something of an alien rite
but its sci fi sheen do not make it ridiculous especially not in comparison with the evening 's final premiere
spectral evidence by the veteran french choreographer angelin preljocaj have two source of inspiration the salem witch trial and recording of vocal music by john cage
olivier theyskens have costume the piece 's four man in dark suit and clerical collar
the four woman wear white dress each with a different patch of red silicon
the patch be distract one resemble a baboon 's buttock and not as meaningful as scarlet letter in a work where all the woman be witch
the action begin promisingly enough with man of the cloth seat on slab
the four witch materialize from behind cover the man 's eye and manipulate the man 's body
amar ramasar and robert fairchild do a severe puritanical dance to liturgical sound chant
then mr. fairchild precise and forceful throughout smite the air with a two handed karate chop
the slab break into ramp and the work start to go downhill
mr. preljocaj 's choreography for these witch who just want to be love and these hypocritical man who find them tempting but sinful have some drive and snap
tiler peck as usual make the most of it
but as the work continue it come to resemble a supernatural creature that just wo not die
the lapse in taste get bad and bad and the literal reduction of the breath noise and sound effect in the cage composition hit a nadir with poor mr. fairchild 's acting possess while lip syncing
it ' strange no the record voice he mouth ask in french
yes and not in a good sense
at best city ballet have acquire a halloween dance
too bad the fall season run only until oct. 13
that still give you five more chance to see spectral evidence
mr. peck 's and mr. millepied 's work which have more than car crash appeal be not on the schedule
be poor planning to blame

he relish introduce customer to new flavor fresh banana blossom say which he score from a grocer in tucson
or chapulines grasshopper bring to him by a customer from oaxaca
people say whoa that ' scary,'â he relate with glee and i say
no man it ' food.'â
the next day we walk the trail on boston hill in town start behind old cottage and wind up past the long abandon silver mine that give the city its name
in the wilderness at the top we rest on an incongruous turquoise blue bench
below us silver 's core look tidy and timeless
the town founder be determine to make a lasting place unlike other slapdash mining camp

for many cyclist rid a bike be a kind of heaven
you 're simply a body breathe clean air and have very few thought
that ' the meditative side
it do not hurt that the sport be kind to the knee
that ' the non load bearing exertive side
then there be the fan who like to mosey the leisurely bike rider
no spandex or clock speed for them
they do not pay attention to the mile
it ' just the wind in their face and the tranquillity and peace that they feel
with the advent of fall three writer tell us about their favorite bike journey from a beloved route along roll field and lake champlain in vermont and upstate new york to a ride in the wild green countryside of western ireland and a night ride in paris road closed
not to me
a road closed sign be always a gamble on a bike ride
ignore it and be reward with mile of tranquil car free riding
usually the road damage be passable on a bike
then there be the day when a dead end force a retreat and a detour
that be the choice we confront in the lush foothill of the adirondacks in new york
the sign block a scenic alternative to mile of rid on the shoulder of state highway 22
beyond it a smooth dirt road pass beneath a ceiling of maple and hemlock branch that tint the summer light green
after a brief consultation with my friend and rid partner sean luitjens we wheel around the sign
i hope we do not regret this i say
even without this hiccup our trip around the midsection of lake champlain which separate vermont from new york involve more logistical wizardry than usual
it would take three ferry ride to complete the seven hour 78-mile loop that begin at my house in the college town of burlington vt
we start the ride cycling south past suburban housing tract into hill carpet with hayfield punctuate by the occasional mcmansion and vermont clapboard farmhouse
a swoop down to lake champlain and across the wooden slat of an 1870s era cover bridge bring us to a ferry connect quaint charlotte vt
to the little lakefront town of essex n.y.

jillian sanders frequently visit the facebook page of a high school classmate she have not talk to in year
but these drop in more like recon mission be not entirely pleasant
i do not know why it infuriate me say ms. sanders 31 a freelance book publicist
she 'll often describe say how her favorite ice cream flavor make her happy all day
i feel like she ' lie
i get upset watch people post picture of a rainbow that say i believe in magic upset that they 're project that image and think others be fall for it or that they 're fall for it themselves
maybe i be just jealous
zeke farrow 38 can identify with the impulse
he sometimes virtually check in on a friend with whom he have an acrimonious falling out year ago
i do not know why else i would go to his page except the hope that i will see something bad or narcissistic say mr. farrow a screenwriter base in los angeles
i want to see him prove his own behavior because he can not help it
so if you 're already expect it before you go to their page it ' a joyous confirmation
the new york author david goodwillie 41 spread out his joyous confirmation among a varied ensemble
there be more than a dozen people i would and should block on facebook he say
but i be so astounded and enthralled by their constant posting that i stay friend with them just to see if they 're go to post for the 12th time this week about their book or their baby
these individual be hate read much as you may be do right now with this very article
hate reading usually of social medium provide satisfaction from fury fuel engagement with someone who should theoretically not provide it
our motif rarely come from a position of strength as katie j. m. baker a writer for jezebel describe in her exploration of hate read the internet
i usually hate read alone late at night when i be procrastinate drunk bored or all three she write
when i finally walk away from my computer i feel like i have just binge on a butter sogged bag of popcorn before the movie even start i be slightly nauseate but still can not help lick my finger for more fatty flavor
ms. baker conclude her essay with a vow to go cold turkey as hate reading satisfies my negative energy but it leave me with little more than a false sense of both security and productivity
or as she say in an interview after acknowledge she be not able to swear off the habit completely the practice become way less satisfying after i realize that i be hate reading to feel superior to other people
her self assessment may be a more enlightened version of the finding from alexander h. jordan an adjunct assistant professor of business administration at dartmouth
in a stanford study suggest we underestimate negative emotion in others life a misjudgment exacerbate by the cheery cast of most social medium persona he and his co author write some research suggest that downward emotional comparison can improve people 's well being
it ' when a person 's typically rosy self view be temporarily threaten that self enhancement process such as find people to hate online be trigger professor jordan say in an interview
research have also show that people who be chronically unhappy or low in self esteem be more concerned about social comparison upward or downward in general
so a common way to boost one 's ego through emotion regulation strategy he say be to look down on other people such as read a dumb blog to feel smarter or look at photo to feel more stylish or a drama fill facebook page that may make you feel you 're well adjust
it ' not schadenfreude he note it ' more akin to gloat
bad these sad insecure people in other word most of humanity at one time or another descend into unhealthy feedback loop he say
people look around at others perfect life on facebook feel bad about themselves boost their self regard by put out their own perfect life and/or hate read others page and then their perfect life make others feel bad about their own life in turn

rather than fine dry crumb i prefer to make soft crumb from a day old french loaf cubed and whirl in a food processor which create a coating with a little texture
olive oil be my choice for frying clarify butter or good lard be fine too
make sure the oil be hot but not too hot and do not skimp
you need more than a film of oil in the pan to achieve the perfect color and crunch
season your cutlet both before and after fry it make a difference and serve them as soon as they be ready
i like to scatter a mixture of chop parsley lemon zest and caper over the top along with a sprinkling of chop egg
but a wedge of lemon be all the garnish a well fry cutlet really need
do not forget to administer a good squeeze of lemon juice just before dig in
washington a senior obama administration official say friday that the united states be encourage by the initial inventory that the syrian government have submit of its chemical weapon arsenal
we be pleasantly surprise by the completeness of their declaration say the official who decline to be identify because he be not authorize to speak publicly on the matter
it be better than expect he add
the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the watchdog group know as the o.p.c.w. that oversee the international agreement ban poison ga say on friday that syria have provide an initial declaration of its chemical weapon program
the submission meet the first deadline for syrian compliance that be set down by the framework agreement that the united states and russia conclude in geneva last weekend
american british chinese french and russian diplomat be debate the term of a united nations security council resolution that would enforce the agreement
secretary of state john kerry say on thursday that it be essential for the council to adopt the resolution next week
it start come in yesterday michael luhan a spokesman for the o.p.c.w. say of the syrian declaration
mr. luhan who speak in a telephone interview from the hague say that the organization 's technical expert be study the declaration but would not give additional detail
the declaration 's completeness be an early test of president bashar al assad 's commitment to relinquish syria 's chemical weapon arsenal
the united states and russia agree in geneva that syria have about 1,000 ton of precursor chemical and chemical agent include sulfur mustard and sarin ga
the fact that russia which have be one of the principal supporter of the assad government reach a consensus with the united states on the size of the arsenal after receive an intelligence briefing by american expert suggest that the syrian government would eventually declare a similar figure

michael r. gordon report from washington and nick cumming bruce from geneva
wolfeboro n.h. when it come time to update its popular odyssey minivan for 2014 honda opt not to make a clean sweep it just tidy up around the edge
exterior change to the fourth generation van be so subtle they practically fall into the if you say so category and the body side retain a distinctive but polarizing character line that honda call the lightning bolt
while honda have add some convenience feature it devote much of its attention to improve crash safety
and in keep with the time it have raise the fuel efficiency a bit on some version
but the big attention grabber be an addition that honda claim to be an industry first and one it be heavily promote in its advertising and marketing of the new odyssey a build in vacuum cleaner intend to appeal to parent of small child pet owner and the terminally sloppy
call the hondavac it be develop in conjunction with the shop vac corporation and be tuck into the left bulkhead of the rear cargo area
its hose stretch barely to the farthest reach of the interior
i test the top of the line ex l touring elite which for $ 45,280 include the hondavac and just about everything else short of the kitchen sink
the base lx model start at $ 29,655
my brother visit from ohio use the integrated vacuum to easily clean up dog hair
i stretch the hose to the front footwells to suck up some gravel track in from the driveway
alhough honda do not completely re engineer the odyssey it make significant structural change to enhance front end crash protection
the odyssey use the second generation of honda 's a.c.e. body structure for advanced compatibility engineering which include high strength steel
honda credit this reinforced structure for help most of its new model get the top grade in the new more stringent small overlap crash test that the insurance institute for highway safety begin conduct last year
the new odyssey score the high rating good because it also receive good rating in the institute 's other crash test it receive the high overall designation top safety pick+. no other minivan have yet be subject to the small offset test
in another effort to improve passenger safety honda change the design of the side curtain air bag so that they extend farther forward
the 2014 model be not include in a recall last week of 318,000 odysseys from the 2003 4 model year as well as 2003 acura mdxs for air bag that could deploy without warning
all model now have a rearview camera and trim level start with the midlevel ex l get forward collision and lane departure warning system
these provide visual and audible alert if sensor detect an impending crash or if the vehicle stray from its lane
honda have also include blind spot monitor
the touring elite that i test flash warning on the housing of the side view mirror if a car be detect in the blind spot
other trim level get the honda lanewatch that first appear on the accord it incorporate a tiny camera on the passenger side mirror that display a view down the van 's right side on the center dashboard screen
the engine be essentially the same as last year 's a 3.5-liter v-6 that make 248 horsepower
but all version now come with a 6-speed automatic transmission
previously all but the top two trim line have 5 speed
the 2014 odyssey be rat 19 m.p.g
in the city and 28 on the highway up 1 m.p.g
in either drive mode over the old 5-speed
the odyssey continue to have a mileage advantage over its main competitor the toyota sienna rat 18/25 and the chrysler town country and dodge grand caravan 17/25
my best real world mileage in the 2014 odyssey be 26.7 m.p.g
on a 214-mile round trip with just one passenger
my bad be 21 m.p.g
on a 180-mile round trip from northern new hampshire to this town on lake winnipesaukee with six people on board
over all the odyssey work well as a family room on wheel
it be spacious and seat up to eight
even adult as tall at 6-foot-4 can sit comfortably in the third row without make passenger in the second row seat which slide forward and back for legroom adjustment suffer
the odyssey be reasonably quiet on most road surface for such a big boxy vehicle and the ride be comfortable
my one gripe continue to be the steering
head into a turn be a good time for steering to have some weight and feel
but that ' precisely when the odyssey 's steering feel seem to get light and give up communicate anything to the driver
the navigation system have some quirk
if you decide to deviate from the map route it do not give up and recalculate as quickly as some others do
and twice it tell us that we have arrive several mile before our true destination one of which be a major hotel
in recent year although the odyssey have not be the no 1 minivan in j. d. power 's initial quality or vehicle dependability study it have come in second to various competitor
accord to alg a company that estimate the future value of lease vehicle the odyssey be likely to retain more value after three year than any other minivan
even though it have some minor flaw and the vacuum could be consider gimmicky honda be do something right
although the sienna have a more powerful engine and an all wheel drive option and the grand caravan be less expensive the odyssey have be outsell its competition this year
with family continue their exodus to crossover from van lmc automotive say the minivan share of the vehicle market have slip to 3.4 percent this year from 8.5 percent in 1995 honda be hop a gee whiz gimmick like the vacuum will generate some new customer
when family and friend visit q. if i allow close family and friend visit from abroad to stay with me in my apartment can a co op board say i be sublet
a. it depend on how closely relate you be to your guest and how long they stay
most proprietary lease permit an apartment to be occupy by the shareholder and the shareholder 's family say dennis h. greenstein a manhattan co op and condominium lawyer
in many case he say family be define as a spouse child or stepchild and immediate family member
if the close family the letter writer be refer to be not permit by the proprietary lease they would not be allow to occupy the apartment
but mr. greenstein note that proprietary lease generally permit overnight guest to stay in an apartment for up to 30 day provide the shareholder be also present
a friend will not qualify as a member of the letter writer 's family but would be consider a guest he say
mr. greenstein add that if any payment be be give to the letter writer by the family member or friend the co op board would most likely consider the arrangement a sublet
he say that most lease give the board the right to grant or withhold consent to a sublet for any reason or for no reason and permit subletting may be subject to any condition the board impose
renew after a rent increase q. i do not renew my lease when it be up for renewal because i want to try and negotiate the propose rent increase
the landlord have not get back to me however after repeat effort to reach him
if i just sign the lease now to ensure they do not try to evict me do i have to pay the new rent start at the date my old lease expired which be also the effective date of the new lease or start the date on which i sign the new lease
a.
if the tenant sign and return the lease now he will be responsible for the high rent go back to the commencement date of the lease say samuel j. himmelstein a manhattan lawyer who represent tenant
but mr. himmelstein say that because this appear to be a nonregulated tenancy unless the landlord have already sign the lease the lease will not become effective until it be countersign by the landlord and return to the tenant
if the landlord have accept rent from the tenant subsequent to the termination of the last lease a month to month tenancy have be create he say
if that be the case and the landlord choose not to sign the lease he could start a holdover proceeding basically an eviction action against the tenant but only after serve the tenant with a 30-day termination notice
in that proceeding the court would have the discretion to give the tenant up to six month to relocate condition upon payment of the market rent during that period mr. himmelstein say
wait for an offering plan q.
a good friend have an apartment under a market rate lease in a building that be become a condominium
the lease be in effect when the owner 's conversion plan be accept for filing by the state attorney general 's office
she have not receive a copy of the offering plan
her lease be up at the end of october and the owner be offer to allow her to stay as a month to month tenant
she would like to look at the offering plan to determine whether she can afford to buy her apartment

among them the right to receive a copy of the offering plan the exclusive right to buy the apartment for 90 day the right to any insider discount and the right to decline the owner permission to show the apartment to potential buyer within the 90-day period
if a tenant do not buy the apartment during the 90 day the sponsor must offer a new lease not a month to month lease at a market rate rent
mr. krauss say that if the sponsor have not comply with those rule the tenant can file an action in the court or with the attorney general 's office require the owner to do so
the math averse may not be draw initially to proof the david auburn play that be be present by mccarter theater center in princeton
it be at least superficially about advanced math and mathematician
but mr. auburn 's four character play which win the pulitzer prize in 2001 be really more concerned with the value of trust in relationship than with prove some mind boggle equation that change the world 's understanding of the cosmos
and for all its emotional turmoil the piece be agreeably streak with humor
think of it rather as a nice geek in love sort of scenario and the work become more invite
set on the back porch of a house near the university of chicago the contemporary story center on the 20-someth catherine unsettle by the death of her father robert a celebrated mathematician who become helplessly bughouse as he put it in his late year
catherine relinquish her own academic study in the field to care for robert and now obviously be at loose end
robert 's elder daughter claire who arrive from new york for the funeral fear that the sadly withdraw catherine may have inherit her father 's mental instability as well as some of his genius and urge her sister to return east with her for therapy
hal one of robert 's former student be a friendly stranger in the house who have be vainly sift through score of robert 's scribbled notebook to see whether the man conceive of anything significant during his lengthy illness
as the first act proceeds a romance be kindle between catherine and hal
their budding relationship break down however when catherine show hal the content of a notebook she say belong to her
the disbelieving reaction of claire and especially hal shatter catherine 's frail composure
although the play 's eventual resolution may seem somewhat facile what transpire before be a touching study in filial devotion as brilliant people struggle against their fear of madness
emily mann the mccarter 's artistic director deliver a smart account of the play that look and sound wonderfully intimate within the center 's 360-seat berlind theater
ms. mann and her longtime collaborator eugene lee the set designer provide visual circumstance that seem equally natural and abstract
the chicago back porch be frame against a vast blackboard scrawl with equation theoretical notation and partial erasure in white chalk that suggest the enormous scale of robert 's calculation
it also provide the appropriate environs for a drama in which the figure of robert appear in the flesh during the flashback sequence but also as a presence in his daughter 's mind
persuasive act under ms. mann 's sensitive guidance lend the play a sense of warm actuality
often wrap in a too large cardigan that obviously belong to her father the insightful clothing design be by jennifer von mayrhauser catherine as portray by kristen bush be a spiky yet anxious individual
with her hair scrap back from a plain pretty face sometimes dominate by black rimmed glass ms. bush be believably either vibrant or desolate as catherine contend none too successfully with her violently fluctuate emotion
a craggy michael siberry resemble a white haired raymond massey at certain angle depict the kindly robert with expansive gesture and a resonant voice
thanks to the chemistry share by mr. siberry and ms. bush the scene in flashback between the father and his daughter be particularly poignant
perhaps the production 's most moving moment occur when robert seemingly lucid proudly show catherine his outline for a new proof
as catherine silently scan the notebook with robert beam at her side her eager face cloud and then fall when she realize that her father 's mind have begin to fail him again
dad she say quietly let 's go inside
ms. bush communicate a great deal of heartbreak in those few word
michael braun 's gentle scruffy hal be a lovable fellow who be clearly take with catherine 's mind and her other charm
jessica dickey give an assure performance as the bossy but well mean claire
stephen strawbridge the lighting designer artfully employ side lighting to give a sculptural quality to the actor
the complex sound design create by mark bennett musically percolate with woodwind and string as it punctuate the play 's mood most notably with a sharp crack when catherine make a claim to greatness that conclude the first act so dramatically
proof by david auburn be at mccarter theater center 91 university place princeton through oct. 6

runaway 18-wheeler death defy motorcyclist and vehicular acrobatics that seem to defy the law of physic have become a staple of youtube in large part a result of the availability of dashboard video camera
it ' all entertaining but there be also practical reason for record while drive
the technology be readily available
personal action video recorder be already popular among outdoor sport enthusiast who attach camera like the gopro hero3 start around $ 200 to their helmet
taxi fleet operator be use similar equipment to monitor their driver and to act as an eyewitness when collision occur
for consumer an inexpensive model design specifically for the family car be the genius dvr fhd590 about $ 120 online
the dashcam be about the size of an oreo so it can be instal on top of the dashboard without block the driver 's view
it record full hd video have an led for low light situation and include usb and hdmi port for download and playback
it store file on a microsd card i instal an 8 gb card that cost $ 13
compare with point of view sport camcorder like the gopro model the genius be easy to set up no squinting at endless menu require
it have a build in 2.3-inch color display so there ' no need to have a device like a smartphone to serve as a viewfinder and it come with a power adapter windshield suction mount and a clip to attach it to a sun visor
once plug into a car 's 12-volt outlet the genius dvr fhd590 automatically begin record when the car be start and stop when the ignition be switch off
a build in sensor will initiate emergency recording in the event of an accident and the file remain store until the owner deliberately delete it
on several 200-mile excursion i find the record video clear enough at night to see the vehicle travel around me although on a dark street it be still difficult to pick out a driver enter her double parked car
scenic country drive and urban highway route be capture faithfully
the wide angle camera tend to capture a more inclusive vista than what driver normally focus on however on the interstate the camera 's recording of pass truck in narrow lane look more treacherous than it be in reality
while most driver be unlikely to record a hot lap around a racetrack or witness a meteor strike while on the road dashcams can be useful
i have be the victim of a hit and run by a new york taxi which then run a red light to escape leave an ugly yellow streak down the side of my vehicle
the driver 's dangerous getaway mean i miss catch the license plate number
a dashcam like the genius may have save the day
once market for milady and available only for passenger vanity mirror now come on both the left and right sunvisors of most vehicle sell in the united states
among the 2,192 trim level offer on 2013-model car and truck dual visor mirror be standard on 81 percent accord to chrome data solutions a portland ore. company that provide vehicle description for online shopping tool
but while many well appoint rams silverados and jeeps provide bilateral vanity mirror 262 version of new vehicle do not
they have one visor mirror for the front seat passenger
that just seem crazy say david gartman a sociology professor at the university of south alabama and author of auto opium a social history of american automobile design routledge 1994
it could just be dumb tradition
that ' where the vanity mirror have always be because when couple ride together the man have traditionally do the driving
automaker may assume that since woman stereotypically be the vain sex they need the mirror where they sit the passenger side he add
even if woman clamor loud than man for vanity mirror as one big automaker say they do place just one on the passenger 's side make little sense dr. gartman say since family now have a car for each adult in the household which mean woman be probably drive themselves and their child
for the first time more woman than man be in the driver 's seat accord to a study release last year by the university of michigan 's transportation research institute
in 2010 the report say 105.7 million woman be license to drive in the nation compare with 104.3 million man reverse a longtime gender gap
yet some automaker be not cater to those woman at the wheel
on the nissan versa sedan a passenger side vanity be optional on the sv version and standard on the sl with no driver side mirror available for either model
and for all smart car a vanity be standard for the passenger but not even an option for the driver
it certainly have nothing to do with gender role john curl a regional product manager for nissan say of the versa about half of which be buy by woman
we have only enough money for one mirror and we decide it should go on the passenger 's side he say add that regardless of gender the driver can use the rear view mirror while a vanity mirror could be a driver distraction
it would be exceedingly odd if you only have one to put it on the driver 's side he add
i think you would get customer complaint
but accord to chrome data version of three 2013 vehicle the chevrolet spark dodge journey and honda cr z do just that
dr. gartman the sociologist say the boom in man 's cosmetic and plastic surgery suggest that man be just as vain about their appearance as woman
but if vanity be gender neutral request for vanity mirror be not say justin healy the global overhead system supervisor for engineering at ford
he say that when ford survey s.u.v. driver in 2009 about their favorite visor feature 54 percent of all respondent ask for a mirror
among woman the figure be 70 percent
he say dual vanity mirror be standard in 90 percent of ford vehicle the exception be commercial vehicle and entry level car
but in those with a solo mirror why give it to the passenger
we 're hedge our bet that the driver will use the rear view mirror for a quick check mr. healy say
or maybe not mary sipes vice president for global planning and program management at general motors look into that in 2005 when she be a vehicle line director
she ask engineer to climb into an s.u.v. and check their teeth after eat broccoli
pamela flores a g.m. spokeswoman recall that the man use the rear view mirror the woman go for the vanity on the visor
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 22 2013an earlier version of this article misspell in one reference the surname of a sociology professor at the university of south alabama and the author of auto opium a social history of american automobile design

three man convict of murder a federal express executive in 1995 have be free since january when a judge in the bronx order them release from prison after vacate their sentence
but it be not until friday when a prosecutor say her office would not seek to retry them in the case that they learn that they be truly rid of the charge
the three devon ayers michael cosme and carlos perez have be convict of murder the executive denise raymond in her apartment in the soundview neighborhood
along with two other people the three be also convict of kill a senegalese cabdriver baithe diop day later in the same neighborhood
the conviction in the cabby 's killing fall apart in 2012 after an investigator for the united states attorney 's office in manhattan reveal that two former gang member who have become federal informant have confess to the crime
because prosecutor have link the two murder the conviction in the raymond case be also throw into doubt
in january at the request of prosecutor justice denis j. boyle of state supreme court in the bronx vacate the conviction of mr. ayers mr. cosme and mr. perez and order them release from prison without bail
but he also agree to give prosecutor a chance to see if they could come up with new evidence for a second trial
on friday a prosecutor nicole keary say such evidence have not surface
the district attorney 's office have determine that we will not prosecute the defendant for the murder of denise raymond she tell justice patricia dimango
justice dimango then dismiss the case and seal the record take the last step to end the three man 's involvement in the matter
ms. keary say investigator have look at a bloodstain on a piece of glass that have be find in mr. cosme 's home fingernail clipping from the body of ms. raymond and handcuff and duct tape that have be use to bind the victim before she be shoot in the head
she say that the blood on the glass have come from a man not ms. raymond and that the fingernail clipping have not yield a dna match to the man
the duct tape ms. keary say contain so much of ms. raymond 's dna that any other biological material would be mask
and three set of handcuff recover from the crime scene be contaminate when a surge of water cause by hurricane sandy flood into a storage facility
in addition ms. keary say one witness in the original trial have die and the testimony of a second have be substantially compromise
she tell justice dimango that the decision to vacate the indictment do not mean the man be exonerate but defense lawyer strenuously disagree with one describe the original case as dubious from its inception
as he leave the courthouse mr. cosme 38 call the decision to vacate the indictment a huge weight off my shoulder
a few minute later mr. perez say he be grateful to the judge and to his lawyer
i lose so much in those 18 year in prison for a homicide that i do not do he say
i 'm glad the truth come out
if sammy obeid have learn one thing from perform stand up for 1,000 consecutive day it ' to embrace his inner robot
mr. obeid 29 who be to finish his ironman project on friday night have long be a drive goal orient perfectionist
he earn a 3.9 grade point average at the university of california berkeley major in applied mathematics and business administration before try comedy which he approach with the same rigor
joke can be very systematic he say in an interview by skype on tuesday
what be the right word that fit in this blank to make this equation work
how do its meaning evoke the best laugh
his stand up display an analytic style full of wordplay clever misdirection and ethnic humor riff on his middle eastern root he ' lebanese american
in one of his characteristic joke he say i believe god be a woman
so i do not say amen
i say
that ' what she said.'â
as soon as he start perform six year ago mr. obeid meticulously track the success rate of each joke
now he give them grade a a + a++ a+++ base on quantity of laugh and have organize the joke into list
this thing that i do be an example of who i be a very mechanical robotic person i discover that about myself mr. obeid say
originally he undertake the 1,000-day project to accelerate his evolution as a comic
he be inspire partly by the 10,000-hour rule popularize by the writer malcolm gladwell which say that an extreme amount of practice be require to become exceptional in a cognitively demanding pursuit
mr. obeid say he have be perform every day for around a year when he hear of another comic hal sparks who have do so for two consecutive year
so mr. obeid become determined to break the record he pick a round number 1,000 and establish rule
to qualify he would need to tell joke for a minimum of three minute and his set have to be present as a comedy show
reflect on his accomplishment mr. obeid sound proud if slightly weary
i 've be die for this to be over for the last year he say
his streak may be unprecedented but mr. obeid be still one of many comic who perform nightly in multiple show
the feat also raise a question often discuss in stand up circle how long do it take to master the art
natural talent vary and there be very funny young comic today like michael che who have have a lot of success in a short time but the virtue of pay your due be not only deeply ingrain but it be also often talk about with great specificity in comedy
mr. gladwell focus on hour but comedian be more likely to talk in year
in his address at the just for laughs festival this year colin quinn say it take 10 year just to know if you be good
in an e mail the comic amy schumer get even more granular estimate that if you have a talent for comedy and work at it at least four night a week you can come up with a good 10-minute set in three year
a solid hour consistently take 10 year she write
i think maybe i do not know that some comic emphasize year live instead of time onstage hint at another argument that stand up a personal art form that rely on the strength of one voice require life experience as much as practice
in an interview with the web site splitsider.com pete holmes a stand up comic with a late night talk show on tbs start next month argue against focus exclusively on perform
i think you need to live a life worth comment on he say
ken reid a comic from boston with 11 year of experience add that you can practice yourself out of be interesting
you need enough skill to be able to express yourself he say but i would much rather see an unpolished raw voice

mr. obeid say he have think about this point but conclude that rigorous compulsive enterprise be a reflection of who he be
people have tell me we do not know who you be
we just see jokes,'â he say
now i be like
that ' just me
i be a robot
i do not care
i be a machine
i stay in do work go to bed
at the same time he recognize that his relentless schedule play a part in the breakup with his girlfriend
she be patient but want more from me but i do not give it because i want to put this first he say sound downbeat
when she be go i realize i could have compromise
still his career have take off
he make his late night television debut on wednesday on conan
he ' work on a book and a documentary about the streak
after a 10-day rest which begin after his 1,001st straight show in san francisco on saturday mr. obeid will embark on a college tour
he say his onstage confidence be high than ever his writing lean
with the tone of a war veteran he talk about the night his streak almost end
on one sunday late in his run after fail to be book at the punch line in san francisco mr. obeid be in a panic that the project would falter so he show up unannounced at a bar where he once appear at an open mike night
after much plead the manager turn off the karaoke machine to let him perform but he be greet with hostility and cursing
five minute in a karaoke fan come up to mr. obeid pretend to ask for a fist bump but instead punch him in the stomach
the music be turn back on and the karaoke resume
i 'd already do my five minute so i do not care mr. obeid say relief washing over his face
it be worth it
washington
when a friend invite teal pennebaker to a party in the nation 's capital ms. pennebaker have just one question i ask her will there be a lot of jonahs there?'â she say
ms. pennebaker 31 a washington- base policy writer be refer to jonah ryan the white house liaison to the vice president 's office on hbo 's veep and one of the show 's deliciously obnoxious character memorable as much for bask in his proximity to power as for his attempt to use what little status he have to get sex
it ' a dead on very apt way to describe a certain type of d.c. guy ms. pennebaker say
it ' such a great descriptor
oh he ' such a jonah or that party will be all jonahs
let 's not go.'â for those curious the answer come back no the party be a jonah free zone
if aaron sorkin 's west wing represent an idealized democratic presidency powerful people do good thing and inspire a swath of young viewer to enter public service the late generation of political television offer a more dystopian vision of the nation 's capital
the distinctly dark house of cards on netflix serve up powerful people do bad thing while scandal on abc provide powerful people do bad thing in what they believe be in the service of good thing
but veep which be in the running for four emmy awards this sunday include one for best comedy manage to repurpose politics as lowbrow farce and offer perhaps the most realistic glimpse at the banal task humdrum day and outsize ego that make up the daily life of the city 's political staff member largely powerless people do thing
as such the character in the show which revolve around fictional vice president selina meyer play by julia louis dreyfus and her often hapless always curse staff have quickly become an in the know byword for certain d.c. archetype in the same way that sex and the city capture a whole generation of woman as carries or mirandas
these thing work their way into our vocabulary particularly in self referential community that like see themselves portray in the medium say ron klain a former chief of staff to vice presidents joseph r. biden and al gore
i think in all profession people like shorthand way of refer to thing and use popular culture reference to refer to thing
and i think washington in particular love to see itself portray on television or love to see itself portray in the movie
for bill burton a former deputy press secretary for president obama veep allusion have become a convenient way to capture a certain type of washington social climb behavior
a situation will occur and i will say do you watch veep
that ' totally what jonah would do,'â
mr. burton say
the jonah be the most spot on depiction of washington ever construct
i know 100 guy like that

montclair n.j. glacier an enthralling and important new dance work last 60 minute by the choreographer liz gerring abound in arrest contradiction
the dancer look relaxed and galvanize
they hurl themselves into impetuous slide skim across the stage in nimble footwork push their way urgently backward on all four shimmer in turn or bob jump and yet amid the formal structure always keep an informal quality never let the step acquire any veneer of academicism
step look natural athletic and exploratory even when they then come around a second or third time with other dancer
the work have wit without quirkiness passion without emotionalism its mood change like the weather and its ebb and flow carry aspect of poetry and excitement
this work 's world premiere be give on thursday as part of the peak performances series at the alexander kasser theater at montclair state university where robert wierzel 's design make virtuoso use of the stage
the main area be back by a single white board like a blank cinema screen
this however be just the central panel of an all white triptych so lighted by mr. wierzel that we first wonder if we 're watch mirror effect on either side
this question be further by ms. gerring 's choreography which at time differentiate between the main stage area dance and visible wing space nondance but at other moment let the dance carry on into the wing as if break down boundary and world
the piece be marvelously heighten by michael j. schumacher 's music from which the piece take its title
he incorporate a field recording of sound from a summer sojourn near glacier lake in colorado into a score tap not play live for guitar harp cello clarinet recorder piano and other keyboard instrument
at time pattern of sparse descend two note piano phrase recall debussy 's ãtude we seem close to the flapping of wing an overlap of different instrument suggest not musical harmony but a soundscape of wide multiplicity
pleasure in this work be clinch by how individual ms. gerring 's dancer look and how specifically release by this choreography
i have admire benjamin asriel in work by several contemporary choreographer
here he arrive relatively late in the piece he look newly focus but free
in one phrase as he tip slowly forward on one leg in an arabesque line he become like the needle of a magnetic compass piercingly direct in his adjustment of the angle
brandon collwes best know from his year with the merce cunningham dance company have always dance with a large scale innocence here that quality gain new intensity
step repeatedly onto the ball of one foot in a series of turn but each time tilt his torso way to one side he make you feel in your own body the physic of the step
tony neidenbach adele nickel brandin steffensen jake szczypek jessica weiss and claire westby complete the team change the mood with each entry
entrance and exit be lively ingredient of ms. gerring 's style
often she make compositional joke out of them no sooner bring a dancer onstage than send him off again only to recall him a moment later this time for an extended stay
two woman end a duet with an unforgettable exit
side by side they find themselves hold hand as they jump upward from both foot slowly retreat on a diagonal path it ' the way that they parallel and synchronize in this wonderful image of naã¯vete hover artlessly in each jump that catch the heart
mr. neidenbach a longtime gerring performer of marvelously athletic presence enter by go around in a circle on one side of the stage as he alternately run and walk
that alternation run a half circle then walk another with minimum gear change repeatedly be one of the dance contrast that proliferate in this piece rivetingly
later hauntingly mr. neidenbach cross the stage in one forward skip hopscotch sequence of tiny but top speed step then without miss a beat retreat backward in a big crawling phrase on all four two utterly opposed kind of movement both deliver coolly but excitingly
another beauty of the gerring style be the keen focus she give to her dancer
they do not just do movement they aim it
witness the opening phrase a man and a woman enter together stand and wait look and bend forward
and then simultaneously they turn their eye head and one arm upward and sideways
a simple stroke it at once establish the full three dimensionality of their style
a late motif also basic be a side to side phrase in which the dancer throw up a right arm then step the other way the left arm
the head turn to look at the view the arm have open up
as you watch you sense yourself do it
at first glacier look like a study in stylized pedestrianism flat foot with the dancer show how exactly they perform nonvirtuoso move
but its texture build up and grow complicated
woman then man travel on half toe across the stage jump and turn enter the vocabulary
there be eight dancer though usually few be onstage at any one time it become customary to see several thing go on simultaneously
simple movement remain central as when four man stand in a row face us with arm outspread
one woman enter seem to listen to one man 's heart two other woman unnoticing dance in the background
dancer here be primarily soloist
but partner do occur both same sex and especially opposite sex
there ' a sequence for three male female couple while the geometric patterning be satisfy they at one point correspond to the three screen behind there ' no one moral pattern for male female behavior you see woman lead and support as well as follow and be lift
as glacier deepen and grow in texture it change from a seemingly analytical study into a diverse world
the analytical quality which never vanish add fascination
the diversity add humanity
by scrutinize movement and demonstrate its multifaceted complexity glacier prove not only absorb but also move

the council be fairly toothless because president mahinda rajapaksa of sri lanka have centralize much of the government 's power in his and his family 's hand

as the pianist ahmad jamal and the member of the jazz at lincoln center orchestra take their bow at the rose theater on thursday night someone in the crowd file a simple but urgent request
poinciana
he shout against the applause poinciana
he shout again hoarsely
poinciana
poinciana poinciana
eventually reality set in the house light go up and the audience begin to file toward the door
poinciana in case the name mean nothing to you be a tune by nat simon that mr. jamal record with his trio in 1958
a small masterpiece of float groove careful in its application of pressure it belong to the small society of jazz composition that have become runaway pop hit
just as take five define brubeck and desmond it have be an ageless signature for mr. jamal and maybe a bit of a burden give the irreducible scope of his output since
why should it matter that mr. jamal do not play poinciana here amid the festive light pomp of the season opener for jazz at lincoln center
he do play it in the same room a couple of year ago likewise when he open jazz at lincoln center 's 2008 9 season in a concert structure exactly like this one
and there be a welcome hint of the tune 's gait and bass line in saturday morning a quietly majestic ballad that mr. jamal offer in the first half
so the omission mean nothing except perhaps as a metaphor
at the end of an elegant two hour concert that showcased mr. jamal 's capacity for build tension within tight space it be bewilderingly easy to feel unfulfilled
just as that guy bark his request do i leave the rose theater in disappointment think about miss opportunity
for me it be not about a song but rather a spirit of engagement
mr. jamal 83 organize his music as a series of dynamic event pinballing between binary extreme loud/soft fast/slow big/small
during the concert 's first half which feature reginald veal on bass herlin riley on drum and manolo badrena on percussion he run the bandstand like a contractor survey a job site often turn from the piano to wave an arm or shoot a glare
every song in the quartet 's 40-minute set involve a form of latin rhythm and every song end with a crisp decisive snap
mr. riley and mr. veal make an ideal rhythm team for this music just as they have for wynton marsalis jazz at lincoln center 's artistic director
on morning mist and silver they lay an earthy foundation trancelike but alert
they be impeccable on saturday morning the title track of mr. jamal 's new album on the jazz village label which feature the same personnel
but the whole mood be terse rein in
that extended to the concert 's second half feature enlargement of mr. jamal 's music by member of the jazz at lincoln center orchestra
one problem be the harmonic inertia of the material baalbek in an arrangement by the alto saxophonist sherman irby could not gather much forward pull even during a trumpet solo by mr. marsalis
it be his only solo all night which make the concert 's title ahmad jamal and wynton marsalis a little misleading
where the second half hit its stride be in two arrangement that capture the variability of mr. jamal 's style
the trumpeter marcus printup make manhattan reflection into an episodic saga with punchy accent give way to grand flow gesture
and the saxophonist ted nash give kaleidoscope a marvelous range of idea include a burst of dixielandish counterpoint follow by a lush canopy of modern chord in descend sequence
then after an interlude by mr. jamal the band rev back into gear swing hard behind a command solo by the trombonist elliot mason
somehow this be the evening 's only stretch of swing rhythm but that be not why it feel like a revelation
it be because mr. jamal and the band seem both lock in and free for a few fleeting moment they leave nothing to be desire
ahmad jamal appear through saturday at the rose theater jazz at lincoln center 60th street and broadway 212 721 6500 jalc.org
this article have be revise to reflect the follow correction:correction september 24 2013a music review on saturday about the opening concert of the jazz at lincoln center season feature the pianist ahmad jamal misidentified the composer of poinciana which become a pop hit for mr. jamal when he record it with his trio in 1958

spain beat france to win the title two year ago but this time it be missing pau gasol and juan carlos navarro
spain will play croatia for the bronze

the man booker prize which have be open to english language novel from britain and the commonwealth have just go global produce anxiety about damage to cultural diversity and fear that the american cultural hyperpower that dominate movie and television will crush the small literary novel
it ' rather like a british company be take over by some worldwide conglomerate say melvyn bragg an author and television host in britain
the booker prize for fiction begin in 1969 be always something that britain and its former territory could call their own see as a bulwark against the spread of the american novel that globalize product of the world 's rich market
the award with its publicity its paycheck and its immediate impact on sale have be an important boost to the career of canadians like michael ondaatje and yann martel and indians like kiran desai and aravind adiga
it have bring attention to novelist previously unknown and unpublished in the united states and it have be an important encouragement to publisher of quality fiction
this week the chairman of the booker prize foundation jonathan taylor say we be abandon the constraint of geography and national boundary to become a truly international prize as a result of consultation that begin in 2011
the change could enhance the booker 's prestige and reputation through expansion rather than by set up a separate prize for americans he say
next year the prize will be open to any work originally write in english and publish in britain not just work by citizen of britain the commonwealth ireland and zimbabwe bring immediate concern that american novel will dominate simply through an economic superpower exert its own literary taste the british novelist philip hensher who have be both a booker finalist and a judge say in an interview
more troubling he say will be the loss of new interesting voice
american novel be already culturally dominant he say it ' hard to think of american novel that do not make their way into the large english world
but i can think of canadian indian african novel that struggle to find a broad readership
karolina sutton a literary agent who work with both american and british author say that the winner of the booker sometimes see a sale bump of hundred of thousand of copy an effect that could multiply if the winner be american
i think it ' terrific for american publisher terrific for american writer and it ' not bad news for reader she say
it will suddenly become more competitive
criticism of the prize have be a literary sport since its inception with complaint about the winner the judge and even the prize dinner
a. l. kennedy who be a judge in 1996 famously and ungrammatically say that the winner be determine by who know who who ' sleep with who who ' sell drug to who who ' marry to who whose turn it be
ms. kennedy be in favor of the expansion of the booker however note that other new prize open to any english language novel publish here like the folio prize â£40,000 or about $ 64,000 which make its first award next january and the international impac dublin literary award 100,000 euro or about $ 135,000 and also open to translation have be nip at its heel
the man booker award come with a prize of â£50,000 or about $ 80,000
the booker have also become less literary some argue suggest that since the man group a multinational financial company take it over in 2002 the rename man booker prize have become more middlebrow

when nbc announce recently that today would host a book club feature online discussion group i think it be a fine idea
i have long romanticize my flesh and blood book club in manhattan because it make me feel as if an important group value me
when i describe fellow member to other people i lead with their strength and accomplishment a brilliant ex banker a onetime speechwriter for a sit vice president and a powerful intellectual with a global following
but the truth be we be a bunch of yenta who sometimes read the same book superficially discuss it in a most erudite way we think and then move on to our favorite subject ourselves
fail marriage high achieve kid and kitchen renovation be just as likely to be topic of discussion as the nuance of daniel deronda
and sometimes frankly there be more blood than flesh
last winter a particularly ugly encounter about whether we could deviate from our practice of alternate classic and contemporary fiction end with an expletive send my way
that night i walk out of the gathering tell two people within earshot i would never return
i have long dismiss online book club believe they lack the intimacy and spontaneity of in person get togethers and that they be the terrain of quiet loner who fear eye contact and physical closeness
these day i have come to think book club intimacy be largely overrated and depend on who ' on the other end eye contact can be quite terrifying
i be far from alone
for eileen mendell of ventnor n.j. book club meeting frequently resemble explosive family counseling session where every infraction become indicative of a deep character flaw
i have personality clash with just about everybody and normally i be a happy friendly cheerful person so it ' strictly the book group that give me problem ms. mendell say
there be some woman who talk about their child nonstop and express no interest in anyone else 's child
yet ms. mendell balk at the suggestion that she may fit in better with an online club
it sound so cold she say
i 'd much rather suffer through the meeting than not see their face
maybe i enjoy be a curmudgeon
and maybe i do not want to give up my cantankerousness
many people though have come to see online book club as an ideal arrangement
felicia day 34 an actress who be feature on the 2003 season of buffy the vampire slayer found vaginal fantasy hangout an online club dedicate to romance fiction with a paranormal twist
the hangout which begin about a year and a half ago and be female only as far as ms. day can tell be sponsor by goodreads a web site that catalog book and help reader set up book group
vaginal fantasy hangout lead by ms. day and three co host have almost 10,000 member and be organize around monthly live stream discussion about two book
in between member chat online which accord to ms. day help the cohesion of the group
i travel quite a bit and the online component make it part of the everyday social pattern she say
there be so many way to interact because everyone be always online
that ' what the internet do best it connect people who have a passion for something
jessica coen 33 say she have discover literature orient gathering work better in theory than in practice
she join a book club a few year ago and dutifully read the first two book but be unable to attend either meet
that be the end of my book club experience and i think that ' the problem with book club in general and it ' why online book club be thrive right now say ms. coen who be the editor in chief of jezebel the popular culture blog
people be busy and even if you set aside time and you 're look forward to discuss the book you can not always make it
during the summer of 2012 jezebel run its own internet book club discuss gone girl by gillian flynn
ms. coen say it be a great success and would likely be repeat

it could be because of edward j. snowden
but it ' more likely the influence of homeland
government secret and betrayal be at the heart of two of the better new network drama this season
hostage on cbs and the blacklist on nbc which both start on monday
like homeland the c.i.a. thriller on showtime that begin a third season on sept. 29 these show be immerse in washington intrigue
each pivot on a heroine who be tear between confrontation and collusion with a male adversary
both be suspenseful and artfully layered and both owe a debt to homeland
but they also share at least one inherent weakness with that showtime hit
hostage star toni collette as dr. ellen sanders a surgeon whose family be take captive by a rogue f.b.i. agent duncan carlisle dylan mcdermott
carlisle then order ellen to make her most famous patient die on the operating table
do n't think of it as kill the president carlisle say
think of it as save your family
there be a murky conspiracy at the top but even ellen 's seemingly normal suburban husband and two child have secret agenda of their own
on the blacklist a young f.b.i. agent elizabeth keen megan boone be pair with an unlikely partner raymond reddington james spader a former government agent turn criminal consigliere who sell secret and abets mobster thief and terrorist worldwide
in the pilot reddington turn himself in and offer to help the f.b.i. track down his blacklist of master criminal but on the condition that he deal only with elizabeth
the show also borrow a bit from silence of the lambs but in this case mr. spader chew the scenery not human kidney
the many layer of feint and puzzle be compelling but it ' hard to see how they can last more than a season or two
the first two episode of season 3 of homeland be disappointing and that ' almost inevitable
conventional television show be call series for a reason whether it be bonanza or law order svu these be serial drama engineer to last with replaceable character and story line that begin and end in under an hour
the best show these day be more like movie than serial with narrative arc that sweep the action and the lead character to a fix conclusion
and subsequent season be more like movie sequel even good one rarely live up to the first and the more there be the more they strain to work
show with two duel character moreover tend to have short shelf life than those with a single central villain
tony soprano keep his criminal enterprise go for six season walter white of break bad be on the verge of shut down after five and woman sometimes outlast the man nancy botwin the pot deal heroine of weeds hang on for a remarkable eight season
when a drama follow the collision course of two enemy of the opposite sex sooner or later they have to consummate their love or their hate
it ' not just sexual tension that wear off after contact so do the piquancy of conflict
the conceit of the first season of homeland be that carrie claire danes alone suspect that the p.o.w.-turn hero brody damian lewis be a traitor by the end of the second season only she believe he be innocent
that formula can hold a viewer 's attention for only so long before it start to feel force
the third season do not just stretch credulity it try patience brody be not in the first two episode there be not even a scene foreshadow his imminent return and there be only so many time viewer can watch carrie go off her medication or brody 's teenage daughter dana morgan saylor act out
the brody family dynamic be not the one that count in this spy thriller it ' carrie 's dysfunctional c.i.a. family that matter
fortunately at least one character her mentor saul mandy patinkin dance to a new tune
los angeles the emmy awards have witness many new player on the red carpet over the year but there have never be a gate crasher quite like netflix
its house of cards be nominate for outstanding drama the first time that a program distribute on the internet have compete at the emmys right alongside program distribute through rabbit ear and satellite dish
and the prospect that a stream video service like netflix could end up a winner at the emmys ceremony on sunday night have cast a spotlight on just how profoundly the television landscape have change
still most television critic and other self profess emmys expert suspect that it ' the cable channel amc not netflix that will have the most to celebrate at the award show
break bad which have be nominate for best drama four time before but have never win be the clear favorite this year
in an e mail debra birnbaum the editor in chief of tv guide magazine borrow a phrase from the series meth lord walter white â break bad be the danger this emmy season
and that ' with just the first half of the show 's final season in contention for an emmy this year
amc break the season into two part and only the first half be televise before the may cutoff date for emmy eligibility
but the second half start to be show in august just as emmy voter be receive their ballot in the mail
what ' more the review have be uniformly glowing and the rating have be build as the sept. 29 finale approach
last sunday 's episode which generate more than 16,000 twitter message a minute at one point be the most watch episode yet with at least 6.4 million viewer
so it stand to reason that the emmy result may reflect all the excitement
ballot be due on aug. 30
this week the web site gold derby which track hollywood 's horse race call break bad the overwhelming front runner
as it turn out the series will be compete with the emmys televise by cbs on sunday night
the three hour backslapping ceremony will begin at 8 p.m. eastern while the 75-minute penultimate episode of break bad will begin at 9 p.m.
since the drama prize be hand out last break bad viewer can change channel afterward to see if the show win
and if it do n't well the second half of the final season will be eligible again in 2014
for amc an emmy for break bad would be a welcome acknowledgment of how it like netflix have change television
until 2008 the only winner of the top drama emmy the most covet of all be broadcast network and hbo.
then mad man come along and amc become the first ad support cable channel to win the top drama award
mad men keep win for four season in a row until showtime 's homeland snap its streak last year
this time around both be nominate again along with break bad house of cards pbs 's downton abbey and hbo 's game of thrones
netflix wo not say how many people have watch house of cards
hbo 's throne may be the most popular of the six hbo say the season finale in june attract nearly 14 million viewer once on demand viewership be calculate
about 12 million people saw the season finale of downton abbey more than seven million saw homeland and nearly five million saw mad man
for the second year in a row no drama from the big four broadcast network be nominate
but the broadcaster be somewhat better represent in the best comedy category where abc 's modern family be vie for its fourth straight win
it be up against nbc 's 30 rock which end in may and be eligible for the final time cbs 's big bang theory hbo 's girl and veep and fx 's louie
the one netflix comedy series that some thought would be nominate arrest development be not
but one of the star of arrested jason bateman be up for best lead actor in a comedy
back on the drama side kevin spacey and robin wright be both up for lead actor and actress for house of cards
bruce rosenblum the chairman of the academy of television arts and sciences say that netflix 's nomination illustrate the evolve nature of tv. this be just the beginning he say
if you look at the quantity of product be develop at netflix and amazon and hulu and xbox it ' certainly reasonable to expect that this evolution will accelerate
have say that the quality of content on broadcast and cable be certainly at an all time high as well
netflix 's presence at the emmys be the result of rule that be amend about six year ago to allow some but not all internet show
netflix be technically already a winner it pick up two award for casting and cinematography last weekend at the creative arts portion of the emmys
but to put that in context hbo pick up 20 include eight for its tv movie behind the candelabra
the record creative arts ceremony will be show by fxx on saturday
the prime time ceremony on cbs will take stock of what many observer have call a golden age of tv.
there remain a wide gulf however between the audience for the academy awards which draw about 40 million viewer this year and the emmys which attract about 13 million in 2012
the academy awards have some advantage namely movie star and 10 brand new film in competition each year
the emmys on the other hand often celebrate returning show with relatively small audience
but mr. rosenblum voice confidence that the rating for the emmys would defy trend line and grow over time
the industry be accelerate from a quality standpoint and from a buzz and pop culture standpoint he say and that at some point will be reflect in our rating

enough please about the cultural elite that all but useless category so baggy it now seem to include practically everyone
no what we really want to know about be the cultural elect the famous people other famous people connive to meet
the kind of people that be who be likely to be find in the upper west side apartment of antonio monda whether it ' a half dozen novelist and spouse for sunday brunch or weeknight dinner or the 75 to 120 journalist critic painter curator columbia professor and more who crowd in to the after party for one of the almost continuous film relate event he run either as organizer or interviewer or both at lincoln center the morgan library and the museum of modern art
recent sighting include philip roth scrunch in a corner under the bookshelf that cover an entire wall robert de niro who stride in a beat after martin amis slip out to smoke a hand roll cigarette zadie smith spring up from the table to chase down her toddler and jovanotti the bearded king of italian rap whose twitter follower at one point outnumber the pope 's
at a time when so many manhattan gathering can seem as transactional as a conference call mr. monda reign as the host of the city 's lively some say only remain cultural salon
only do not tell him so
the word salon make him wince
in italy it give the impression of be lightweight mr. monda who will turn 51 next month say recently in his office at new york university where he be a member of the film and television department 's faculty
he prefer laboratory of idea
mr. monda 's normal style be casual but he be expect at a gala later and so be sheathe in a blue brioni suit purchase at a discount courtesy of his friend gay talese with purple suspender and a blue tie dot with red
mr. monda 's office be both archive and storefront
the wall be cover with movie poster and still and the bookshelf include translation of his book many of them collect interview with a range of eminence like don delillo and martin scorsese
laboratory seem a clinical description for mr. monda 's cozy at home but admirer agree that his party generate unusual excitement
there ' always a crackle of energy in the air the novelist colum mccann who have know mr. monda since 2007 write in an e mail
what antonio be essentially interested in be have people bounce off one another so that what result be the art of great conversation
there be for instance the night mr. monda screen luchino visconti 's film the leopard base on the classic italian novel then lead a discussion on the challenge of adaptation and dubbing
the conversation flow easily and be mercifully free of self promotion
nobody go to a monda lunch to sell a book or flog a new movie mr. mccann observe
it would be very vulgar to take out a stack of business card
the good talk be lubricate by sumptuous but unpretentious dining
i think the secret to his party be the food isabella rossellini a longtime friend say in a phone interview
the food be there for everyone
it ' abundant
and you come and go as you please
at mr. monda 's she can be see in a sweater and jean get up to refill her plate with the home cooked meal prepare by mr. monda 's wife jacqueline greaves who be bear in jamaica and have create her own fusion of island and classic italian cuisine empanadas shrimp ball crostini with pesto and mushroom pasta with a hearty tuna sauce with pine nut cinnamon raisin bowl of giant strawberry wash down with chianti or a white wine purchase in the neighborhood
such improvisation would be unthinkable at other manhattan dinner party
paparazzo be around ms. rossellini say
you have to show you 're the best dress that you 're young and thin
every time i be invite i have to evaluate do i have to have a makeup artist how much do the dress cost
it ' very commercial
informal though he be mr. monda a screenwriter and filmmaker before he move to the united states in 1994 impart an air of the grande spettacolo to all his production include his n.y.u. course to which he invite guest lecturer like the coen brother and wes anderson
mr. monda play himself in a brief scene in the life aquatic with steve zissou
sometimes director ask me to appear in their film he say
i never say no
he do seem custom build for the part of the italian intellectual erudite yet effusive bound from one topic to the next the short story of isaac bashevis singer the religious theme coil inside the subversive film of pier paolo pasolini the curious parallel between italian and jewish american literature each found on the unique relationship with religion with culture with aristocracy

michel say marine corps general joseph dunford who head isaf be try to insulate the training command from any fallout from the procurement problem
if they downscale some of our infrastructure and cut aircraft there ' a degrading effect on our capacity he say
all of these become impediment to our success while we fight the clock
michel who arrive on the job seven week ago say about 70 percent of the hangar taxiway and other infrastructure need to support the air force which be due to expand to around 8,000 people from 7,000 be complete
but he say he fear the remain 30 percent may never get build if problem identify in a recent report by the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar lead to project cancellation
you have to have concrete and building to operate from he say
small but mighty the training mission be be lead by 649 u.s. military adviser contractor and adviser from other nato force
their rank will swell to 1,114 over the next two year after four lockheed martin corp c-130 cargo plane and 20 a29 super tucano plane build by sierra nevada corp arrive

michel 's unit now run seven english course serve about 420 student at any give time
security at six training site in afghanistan be another worry with attack or threat set back training effort and force trainer to reinforce security he say
the more we have to do those kind of security mission the more we have to degrade training he say
a long term concern be whether the afghan military can afford the estimate $ 600 million to $ 620 million a year it will cost to run the air force
that question michel say could have big implication for the training effort and be be debate by dunford the marine corps general and afghan leader
we 're go to consume 15 to 20 percent of their budget
we need to know today if that ' sustainable michel say
despite the challenge he say the afghan air force be flourish in many respect
a casualty evacuation that once take three day can now be execute in three to four hour and afghan pilot recently evacuate 300 villager threaten by major flooding michel say
the air force be also lay the groundwork for the emergence of an afghan aviation sector and the related infrastructure that will help afghanistan attract foreign investment he say

it seed the investment that afghanistan be go to need to really flourish go forward

but who know that the y once try to book a poetry read by mao zedong
i have write to chairman mao grace schulman the center 's director at the time write to one of his translator in 1974 two year after president richard m. nixon 's visit to china
she go on to describe the skeptical reaction she receive from a poet name chang at the united nations after tell him my plan and how important it be for chairman mao to read his poem aloud i hear him laugh uncontrollably for quite some time
but i still hope mao will come
mao do not come
but ms. schulman 's letter unearth during a scouring of the poetry center 's archive in preparation for a 75th anniversary season that begin this month stand as one of the more quixotic episode in the center 's long commitment to the live literary voice
during the anniversary season that literary voice can be hear as usual onstage
it can also be sample on the internet thanks to 75 at 75 a series pair 75 recording from the poetry center 's audio archive it contain more than 2,000 reading with specially commission essay
and start on sept. 25 love the word an exhibition will be in the y 's lobby gallery
it draw on previously unseen photo and rare correspondence from the like of t. s. eliot dylan thomas and robert lowell to illuminate the center 's role in new york 's literary history
these day it can seem like every bookstore bar and bowling alley in the city have be take over by writer seek to read their work in public
but when the poetry center open its door in 1939 with a lineup include william carlos williams w. h. auden and langston hughes the idea that live performance be an essential part of a writer 's job be new
this just be not part of what writer do at the time bernard schwartz the center 's director say during a recent preview of material from the archive
they treat the occasion as more than business as usual he add
today an invitation to read at the y many writer say arrive like a quasi divine summons
the mother of all lectern the poet billy collins say recently when ask to describe the y 's more than-900-seat kaufmann hall ring with name like aristotle maimonides and shakespeare spell out in gold leaf
when you read there you 're aware that just about every writer you have ever admire have go before you say the playwright tony kushner who begin attend reading at the y as an undergraduate at columbia in the 1970
you do not feel like you 're be judge
you feel like you have already be judge
love the word put together by mr. schwartz and ava lehrer contain plenty such testimonial along with glimpse of less high minded aspect of the enterprise
truman capote in 1964 ask if the center could up the standard honorarium still mod today accord to mr. schwartz to $ 1,000
leonard cohen invite the following year say he be happy with $ 100
and when the elderly robert frost give a reading usher be dispatch to fill empty seat
i be in the position to watch the madness of old age eat away some of the old poet and composer elizabeth kray the center 's director at the time write in 1960 to the poet donald hall
one outward sign be their desire for public attention
with mr. frost this be a mania
marianne moore by contrast say in a 1964 letter that she would read only if there be no â hero atmosphere declare it ' regulation or nothing
for her regulation mean wear a tricorn hat and paul revere ish jacket show in a photograph include in the show
elizabeth bishop decline the y 's invitation for decade i suffer too much and i do not think people enjoy see someone miserable she write in 1950 then request that a recording of her first reading there in 1973 be destroy
it be though two other bishop reading survive in the center 's collection
the y whose lineup today be heavy on novelist than poet have also coax some notably retire prose writer into the limelight
don delillo give his first reading for the general public there in 1990
i 'm glad it ' over he write in a note afterward
he have since do three more reading at the y.
the center have long be know for its onstage pairing which this season include allan gurganus and donna tartt colum mccann and norman rush and paul auster and siri hustvedt who first meet at the y in 1981 and have be a couple ever since
love the word also do some sly matchmaking of its own
on one wall a photograph of norman mailer during a 1961 reading which end when the center 's director bring the curtain down during a recitation of obscene couplet hang alongside a portrait of cynthia ozick who in an encounter preserve on youtube stand up at a 1971 panel discussion on feminism to ask the macho mr. mailer what color his ink run after he dip his testicle
that confrontation take place at town hall but ms. ozick say at the time that she have always fantasize about ask him that question at the y. we think they belong next to each other mr. schwartz say
mark golin be in his office at the time life building recently reflect on his go go day as the editor of maxim magazine in the late 1990
we be in a lot of way the barbarian at the gate of rome say mr. golin now 51 and the group editor of style and entertainment at time inc. oversee people entertainment weekly and instyle
there you be you 're sit there with your city sanitation and your senate and everything get beat by guy that do not shower
it feel great he say
it be a lot of fun
during his time at maxim mr. golin relish play the heel but he say he be never the lout or the lad he be portray as at the time
i play the violin he say
i do not drink beer
he also do not read maxim anymore
i 've never read another copy since i leave mr. golin say
i never would have read the thing if i do not work there
the magazine be universally credit for what it ' worth with encapsulate a beer and babe ethos that help make career for people like megan fox and ashley greene even as it raise eyebrow and crinkle nose
but last week it be sell with little fanfare for an undisclosed sum to darden media whose chairman calvin darden sr
issue a statement about expand the maxim brand into a cable network and other platform
he do not return call for further comment
the magazine 's previous owner alpha media group buy the publication and two others since shutter from dennis publishing for $ 250 million six year ago
while magazine of every stripe be struggle with a decline in ad sale it seem safe to assert that maxim have perhaps outlive its power to provoke and titillate
though he no longer read the magazine mr. golin be certain that the maxim man be still out there
what ' change he suggest be the culture that surround him
what have once be what mr. golin call a treehouse for a certain kind of guy have perhaps become the forest
maxim expand out to be easily find in the general fabric of everything mr. golin say
it become expect and accept
look around mr. golin see sign of his former publication everywhere
probably one of the high gross movie or trilogy of movie be the bachelor,'â he say
do mr. golin perhaps mean the hangover
â the hangover
the hangover;'â he say
you can also see some of the maxim man 's grasp ego in a character like kenny powers play by danny mcbride the blustery blubbery former major league baseball pitcher on eastbound down on hbo.
on fox there ' schmidt play by max greenfield on new girl who present a more polished version of a 90s era maxim guy and who embody the kind of behavior deride by susan faludi in her 2000 book stiffed the betrayal of the american man in which she call maxim simpering and sneaky and describe it as a last blast of anachronistic masculinity
schmidt dress as if he just walk out of a spread in detail but his roommate force him to put a dollar into a jar every time he blurt out another sexist or self regard comment
then there ' will ferrell whose every character from ricky bobby to ron burgundy to george w. bush channel the wounded pride of overgrown boy live through what ' be call the end of man
i think ultimately maxim win mr. golin say add that the sophomoric be now find in great abundance on the internet which make a monthly magazine of humor and innuendo less necessary
intend as a raspberry in the face of political correctness maxim be an overnight success follow its transplantation from britain by its owner felix dennis
if national review famously aim to stand athwart history yell stop maxim keg stand the era of identity politics and antioch consent rule
its combination of lad humor pg-13 starlet ogling and service article upend its category inspire its competitor like gq esquire and detail to change their formula 1 2 next page

q. the unusual building at 1782 third avenue at 99th street be list as substation 7 on the national register of historic places but i can not find any information about it
why be it historic
a.
it ' a link to the el
joseph j. cunningham an engineering historian and an authority on new york city 's electrical power system say that this particular substation be one of seven building that provide power to the elevated train operate by the manhattan railway company on second third sixth and ninth avenues
the electrification project which begin in 1898 have its source in the main power station at 74th street and the east river mr. cunningham say in an e mail
there be three substation on each side of manhattan and one in the bronx
the function of the substation be to receive 11,000-volt alternate current from the power house and convert it to 625-volt direct current for the third rail distribution system to the train
the power station and substation begin operate in late 1901 and all train be run by electric power by the spring of 1903
so why be substation 7 historic
my supposition would be that it be because it be the last that resemble the original structure mr. cunningham say
the interborough rapid transit company the first major subway line lease the manhattan railway company in 1903 and their power system be interconnect he say
some substation be replace others remain until the el be demolish
no 7 be the primary supply of power for the upper portion of the lexington avenue subway from 1918 into at least the late 1970 when other substation be construct underground
therefore it never become a commercial structure but be retain for other transit relate work such as storage or field crew space he say
it be still own by m.t.a. new york city transit
by comparison he say substation 2 the only remain substation for the el on the west side be reuse as a hardware and lumber store
while there be numerous retire substation that be build solely for the subway and many that date from the day of direct current utility power for residential and commercial customer no
7 be the only manhattan substation that date from the electrification of the pre subway elevated system and also retain its original appearance mr. cunningham say

milan when stuart weitzman decide to close his shoe box of a store on the via della spiga here and open a fancy new international flagship in the heart of milan 's shopping district he have three architect in mind frank gehry santiago calatrava or zaha hadid
mr. weitzman like to think big
this be the quirky 71-year old shoe designer who for many year before the recession like to make a splash at the oscar with his $ 1 million diamond encrust heel which at the risk of appear tacky never fail to get attention
last year he hire kate moss to appear in his advertising campaign
and people start to think of stuart weitzman who have be design sophisticated but not terribly expensive shoe in new york since he work for his father 's factory in the 1960 as a luxury brand
so he want the milan store to make a statement that mr. weitzman be right up there with ferragamo gucci and prada even though most of his design be much less expensive
only the architect act as if they have never hear of him
it take several cold call to ms. hadid 's london office before anyone would agree to hear mr. weitzman 's pitch and only then he say i get to her heart through her foot
woman love shoe
so there at the open party on the via sant'andrea on thursday night be ms. moss wear a black pantsuit and a big smile as she breeze through a store design by ms. hadid as if it be the interior of a spaceship
mr. weitzman 's signature over the knee boot and his new men' inspire pump many price under $ 400 be align on curve swirl display make of fiberglass with a rose gold trim with suede seat build at odd angle into the display
the gray wall curve inward like a cave make it hard for guest to stand if they venture too close to the side
the shoe business be so much more elevate today say mr. weitzman stand off to the side of the party which have spill out into a garden behind the store
women always have to have them but shoe be never as much a part of their personality as they be today
it ' much more democratic
at that moment a security guard tap mr. weitzman on the shoulder and tell him to move along as ms. moss be stand nearby
but he be on the list
as many woman will attest mr. weitzman be a remarkable shoe designer and in fact his fit model say that he will spend hour go over the placement of strap to make sure there be not the slight bump against the foot
he have be design over the knee boot call 5050 they be leather in the front stretch fabric in the back for 20 year and still he feature the design which cost $ 598 in his fall campaign again with ms. moss
they be again a top seller for the company
like the boot successful fashion be half product and half perception
the brand have go from start out as a shoemaker to be a part of fashion he say
ms. hadid who be know for her futuristic architecture have previously design store for neil barrett and an art pavilion for chanel
she also have recently design shoe for united nude and melissa shoes but that be another story
i like shoe she say in a telephone interview
and i do think retail be really interesting
you often have department store with very expensive clothes and only one mirror where you can not see anything
maybe it ' a trick
her design for mr. weitzman be fill with reflective surface and the seat be make with space for a woman to place her bag next to her rather than on the floor
the idea be to propel a customer from the street right into the display
store be become big now ms. hadid say
they have to compete with online
and there be another aspect of shopping which be entertainment
you need that
mr. weitzman have more than 100 store around the world include 3 others in italy
a quarter of the company 's annual sale which total about $ 350 million come from its own retail business so mr. weitzman who sell the label to the jones group in 2010 say it be important to create a new concept to entice shopper
ms. hadid 's store design will be recreate in five other location include a new york store next year
it be as much for our peer as it be for our customer mr. weitzman say
store like this have open up the eye of retailer around the world to our brand
they be like advertisement to other people in our industry
a store next to chanel on an exclusive retail strip of milan send a powerful message
so do have ms. moss as the star attraction at your party watch a video of herself walk in your boot
we 're never go to sell enough shoe from that image to pay for that one ad mr. weitzman say
but people notice

after hour of harsh questioning from a defense lawyer the psychologist testify for prosecutor twist ever so slightly in the witness stand
how could it be the defense lawyer have ask that 20 other doctor examine the defendant a portuguese fashion model and conclude he be in the throe of a manic episode at the time he kill his companion and only you determine that he be fake it
how could it be that the rule book for your profession say a manic episode can come on rapidly and yet you insist that the book be wrong on that point
and how could you conclude that the defendant who have a degree in physical education from a college in portugal learn how to invent an insanity defense in a college psychology class without have any idea whether he even take such a class
with that william b. barr shift a bit in the witness chair
he tilt his head to one side but he do not lose his cool
it ' my assumption that get a general degree from a university that chance be that someone have study psychology he answer calmly
as an expert witness dr. barr be among a select group of mental health professional in new york city who regularly play a central role in criminal proceeding and he have become something of the go to man for prosecutor when the mental health of a defendant be at issue
there be no record of exactly how often an expert appear for either side but since 2000 dr. barr have be hire by prosecutor as a consultant in more than 100 such case he testify last year
because they be hire largely by word of mouth among like minded lawyer it be all but inevitable that the same expert will be repeatedly call
yet most try to avoid testify more frequently for one side to avoid the appearance that they be tailor their conclusion to the need of the lawyer who most often hire them
dr. barr 's role be often to tell juror that defendant who may seem mentally ill do not meet the legal definition of insanity at the moment they be say to have commit their crime
and his testimony follow an almost predictable pattern defendant be exaggerate a mental impairment and act out of rage
his first major case be the 1999 trial of andrew goldstein who push a young woman to her death in front of a subway train
dr. barr testify that mr. goldstein be exaggerate his mental illness and may actually have attention deficit disorder
yet under cross examination dr. barr acknowledge that he have not read mr. goldstein 's 3,500-page medical history which include repeat diagnosis of schizophrenia
he give similar testimony in the 2007 trial of peter braunstein a former magazine writer convict of sexually assault a former colleague after dress as a firefighter to get into her apartment
dr. barr testify that mr. braunstein exaggerate symptom of schizophrenia during test give answer that be so off the chart that if it be valid it would be one of the most severe form of schizophrenia ever observe in the world
dr. barr 's method and even his mere presence in court have become an increase focus of trial in which he participate
in the trial last fall of the portuguese fashion model renato seabra a defense lawyer rubin sinins ask dr. barr if he simply cut and paste into his report that mr. seabra act out of rage
an expert for the defense dr. roger martin harris the former director of psychiatric unit at several local hospital who now teach forensic psychiatry at new york medical college testify that dr. barr be create his own diagnostic system in ignore definition in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders sometimes refer to as the bible of mental disorder
i respectfully think that dr. barr be go out of his way try to make mr. seabra responsible for the crime dr. harris say 1 2 3 4 next page

people gasp when his name be call out
he be 76 seemingly another rigid conservative not the young dynamic figure many catholics have hop for
now six month later the surprise keep come include the pope 's new remark that the church risk become a small chapel overly fixate on sexual morality and should instead offer a broad more inclusive message
francis be challenge the status quo of the roman catholic church so determinedly and so unexpectedly that vatican watcher be debate whether this be merely a change of tone as many have think at first
some now think the pope may be make a deliberate effort to shake up the vatican govern hierarchy know as the curia and prepare the ground for a more fundamental shift in the direction of the church
i think we be look at major change say john thavis a longtime vatican observer and author of the vatican diaries

there be a lot of disorientation inside the roman curia
they use to feel they be in charge
right now they know they be not in charge
the late unexpected jolt from pope francis come in an interview conduct with a jesuit journalist and release thursday in jesuit publication around the world
francis himself a jesuit chastise the church 's narrow focus on controversial social issue and call instead for a more merciful and less judgmental church
he have already send out earlier signal decline to live in the papal apartment in the apostolic palace chide prelate for drive fancy car and announce that church property should be use as shelter for refugee
francis do try to temper the impact of his remark on friday tell an audience of catholic gynecologist that abortion be a symptom of our throwaway culture and urge them to refuse to perform the procedure
but there seem little question that francis want to change the papal conversation
his predecessor benedict xvi often seem engaged in an angry verbal jousting match with secularism and modernity usually deliver through formal encyclical or speech that to many catholics feel like a personal rebuke
the church seem like a rigid institution dictate impossible norm to follow an overly severe mother say lucetta scaraffia a scholar of catholicism in rome
by contrast pope francis have make impromptu telephone call to people who have write him letter seek help while also thrive on socialize with other priest and laypeople
he be assume the tone of the parish priest many analyst say recognize that people struggle daily with issue of conscience and that the church rather than shake a finger must offer a broad message of comfort and healing
many analyst have seize on an analogy cite by francis in his interview the church as a hospital in a battlefield
people have be wound in a war over secularization say ms. scaraffia a history professor at the university of rome la sapienza
he ' say let 's look after the wound
that ' more important than win the war.'â the deep challenge confront the church become evident after benedict 's stunning decision to resign early this year
allegation of mismanagement be erupt in the vatican and accusation of impropriety shake the vatican bank
many cardinal blame the problem on the secretive administrative body the roman curia and want benedict 's successor to usher in major reform that would decentralize power
pope francis have already signal his independence from some of the vatican 's traditional channel and his big governance move as yet have be the creation of an advisory group of eight outside cardinal to help him usher in curial reform
but in his interview he hint that big change could be come include possible structural change to the conference of bishop know as synod
he also pointedly warn that certain department in the curia when function poorly risk become institution of censorship

caracas venezuela in the late diplomatic dispute between the united states and venezuela american official late thursday give permission for president nicolã¡s maduro to fly over puerto rico on his way to a state visit in china and deny angry accusation from venezuelan official that the united states have try to bar mr. maduro from its airspace
but venezuela 's accusation resonate among some of its leftist allies in the region who compare the contretemps to the incident in july when president evo morales of bolivia be deny permission to fly over some european country because accord to bolivian official they wrongly suspect his plane be carry edward j. snowden the fugitive american intelligence leaker
leftist leader at the time accuse the united states of be behind that incident although washington say it be not involve
on thursday mr. maduro and foreign minister elã­as jaua accuse the united states of bar mr. maduro from american airspace call it an act of aggression
but on friday roberta s. jacobson the united states assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affair say that be not true and that the request have never be deny
american official say that instead venezuela have not follow normal procedure in submit its request to enter american airspace and that washington have grant it anyway
a state department statement say that venezuela have make the request on wednesday just a day before mr. maduro 's schedule departure when such request be suppose to be make three day in advance
official also say that mr. maduro be fly in a cubana airlines jet and that diplomatic flight request be suppose to involve official state aircraft
the statement say that despite all of that the united states have work with venezuelan official to get the approval do quickly
this whole thing be absurd ms. jacobson say
this be a request that come in very late for an aircraft that be not a venezuelan state aircraft and therefore would not normally get diplomatic clearance and we get it do as quickly as we could so we do not understand this reaction
but venezuela treat the flight request as a major international incident
mr. maduro say the united states have deny permission to use american airspace and say the united states have make a serious mistake
mr. jaua say it be an aggression against venezuela
the dispute fit a pattern of recent incident in which venezuela a major oil supplier to the united states have grab onto seemingly innocuous comment or action by american official that it then seek to turn into major confrontation
mr. maduro have increase verbal attack against the united states since he be elect in april to replace the country 's longtime socialist president hugo chã¡vez portray washington as an imperialist aggressor intent on undermine his government
in the end however the permission be grant and mr. maduro say in a twitter post just before 10 p.m. that he be depart for china
it be not clear however what route the plane take or if it pass over puerto rico which be a commonwealth of the united states
it be also unclear why venezuelan official choose that route
the first leg of mr. maduro 's flight take him from caracas to paris an official say
robert w. mann jr. an airline industry analyst in port washington n.y. say that the most direct route from caracas to paris be over the less antilles and that fly over puerto rico which be farther north add about 100 mile to the flight path
he say that there could be valid reason to travel the extra distance include wind forecast or technical issue associate with the type of aircraft be use
but he suggest another reason
it could also have be a sharp stick in the eye he say

and give some of the personality involve that ' always possible
the dust up be use by other south american government to lash out at the united states
mr. morales speak at a news conference in santa cruz bolivia accuse the united states of carry out a policy of intimidation and say he plan to file a lawsuit in an international court charge president obama with crime against humanity

sea ice in the arctic ocean undergo a sharp recovery this year from the record low level of 2012 with 50 percent more ice survive the summer melt season scientist say friday
it be the large one year increase in arctic ice since satellite tracking begin in 1978
the expert add however that much of the ice remain thin and slushy a far cry from the thick arctic pack ice of the past
because thin ice be subject to rapid future melting the scientist say this year 's recovery be unlikely to portend any change in the relentless long term decline of arctic sea ice
i 'm not at all surprised there be a jump upward we have never set two record low in a row say walt meier a nasa scientist who have monitor sea ice for year
i would say i be a little surprised the jump be as big as it be
last year 's ice extent be so low that this year 's recovery look large by comparison dr. meier say
the main reason for this year 's growth dr. meier add be that the region be cold and cloudy through the spring and summer than in the recent past
we have cool condition cooler than the long term average and yet it be still go to be the sixth low ice minimum on record dr. meier say
play out over a generation the decline of the arctic ice cap have be one of the most striking effect of global warming a change in the planetary aspect so large it would have be visible to an observer on the moon
we could be look at summer with essentially no sea ice on the arctic ocean only a few decade from now say mark serreze director of the national snow and ice data center in boulder colo. in a statement
contrary to popular impression the melting of sea ice do not cause a rise of sea level since the ice be already float and displace its weight in water
but the replacement of white ice with dark water do mean the surface of the arctic ocean can absorb far more heat in the summer which could contribute to the melting of nearby land ice in greenland raise sea level
during the winter the arctic plunge into near darkness 24 hour a day and a skin of ice grow across most of the ocean surface
but during the summer the sun shin continuously
the key to the status of the ice cap be how much of it survive the summer melt season to become thick resilient ice
when satellite monitoring begin in the late 1970 about half the surface of the arctic ocean would be cover by ice at the end of the melt season which usually occur in september
by last year that figure have fall to 24 percent of the ocean surface rise this year to 36 percent
the national snow and ice data center announce friday that the low point in sea ice this year have occur on sept. 13
the timing vary from year to year and the agency always wait several day before make an announcement to be certain the ice pack have begin to regrow
lately a new low in summer sea ice have be set every few year follow by a few year of recovery follow by yet another low that typically exceed the previous one by a substantial margin
bad homburg germany europe have barely be mention in the german election campaign
but in the final day before sunday 's vote a fringe party that want to scrap the euro be gain in the poll threaten to scramble the country 's consensus politics with a message that have echo of the tea party in america and rightist movement elsewhere in europe
chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats be expect to emerge victorious from the election
but poll be give the upstart party alternative for germany a decent chance of win seat in parliament for the first time
its surprising strength could have an outsize effect on the shape of the next german government and help determine how far it can go in satisfy the desire among its european union partner for more forceful step to end the continent 's economic crisis
a small but committed minority of germans see the party as the only alternative to mainstream party too timid to admit that the euro have fail
and the party have offer a home to more socially conservative germans who be unhappy with the way ms. merkel have push the conservative bloc to the center on social issue like gay right
in recent day there have be a sense of euphoria among alternative for germany 's supporter about its chance of win a share of power
i be convinced they will get into the bundestag say ingrid cook 63 who live in bad pyrmont in northwestern germany and translate technical manual for a machinery company
mrs. cook say friday that she have be hand out leaflet and work at party information stand in her area
i have grandchild and i want to be able to tell them i saw the catastrophe come and try to do something about it she say by telephone
alternative for germany be poise to drain vote from ms. merkel 's party and its junior partner in government the free democratic party enough perhaps to prevent the free democrats from reach the 5 percent of the national vote need to return to parliament
such a result would leave ms. merkel no alternative but an awkward coalition with her main opponent the center leave social democrats
while alternative for germany would be too small to have much sway over policy it could be a loud and disruptive voice in debate about measure to prevent the collapse of the euro offer a rightist challenge to the determine centrism ms. merkel have pursue in her eight year as chancellor
as it have gain in strength the party have be try to move beyond a fixation with abolish the common currency and attract social conservative by talk about issue like family policy and tax reform
in the past few week the party have understand the need to expand beyond their image as a single issue party and position themselves as an alternative for people who be socially conservative and no longer feel the christian democratic union represent them say oskar niedermayer a political scientist at the free university of berlin
alternative for germany be decidedly a work in progress attract an eclectic group of supporter who seem to be unite only by their conviction that the mainstream party be not discuss the issue important to them
it remain to be see whether the party can become a lasting force in german politics in the same way that the green party emerge from the environmental movement in the 1980 or whether like so many other issue drive party in the past it will self destruct amid squabble over doctrine and leadership post
the party 's contradiction be on view at a forum it sponsor thursday evening in bad homburg a wealthy suburb of frankfurt
one man in the audience stand up to urge the party to take a stand against same sex marriage
konrad adam one of the party 's leader concede that it have no official stance on the issue
we do not have a position on every question mr. adam say speak from the stage of a community center
another man rise to say germans should get extra vote for each child they have as a way of rewarding people who be help to stave off population decline
mr. adam a 71-year old former political reporter say he think that be a good idea while again caution that the party have no official position
in a country that have have public health care since the 19th century the party 's rejection of government however be selective 1 2 next page

this be all so surreal and exciting ms. lindsay write on her twitter account
i love my sister already and happy to be an alpha gam
the national headquarters of alpha gamma delta do not respond to a request for comment
news of the admission cap a tumultuous week for the university the site of a wednesday demonstration by hundred of student and faculty member who demand an end to long run racial bias on the campus
in march to the rose administration building the protester recall the action of gov. george wallace who 50 year ago try to bar african american student from enrol at the university where black now make up more than 12 percent of the student body
although segregation in alabama 's greek system have be the subject of periodic anger and conversation through the year the issue resurface last week when the crimson white publish an interview with a woman who describe the conduct inside the alpha gamma delta sorority house during august 's recruitment process
accord to the woman melanie gotz the sorority 's alumna forbid current student from offer bid to two black woman one of them the stepgranddaughter of a member of alabama 's board of trustee
after day of escalate pressure dr. bonner in an abrupt reversal of the university 's longstanding contention that the privately run greek organization should fashion their own membership standard order the sorority to engage in a protracted recruitment process
on friday she say that step be already yield positive result and she expect the sorority to continue to broaden their membership throughout the academic year

not too long from now karl lagerfeld will pass a milestone in fashion
he will have spend 50 year at fendi design its fun fur and cerebral ready to wear
mr. lagerfeld have not exactly spend a half century look out a single window
he work for chanel too
and lately he have be slap his name on product at a do or die rate
at least one part of his brain remain by design slow and analog in its thinking with broad excursion to the past
and it ' this part i suspect that keep him root in one place for so long
but the other part be highly alert and reactive constantly move toward new idea and devour them
with good reason he have be compare to a shark
whatever account for this vital mix of the comfortable and the hard wire mr. lagerfeld keep re energize himself
with fendi more than chanel he like the idea of digital technology this season he use word like informatics and hyperlinked to describe the modular design of the clothes as well as the grid pattern
it ' very possible that he do not have a clue what these term mean
but the language and imagery of the web give him an idea and that ' what he react to
in truth if you want a better think picture for the opening dress in the fendi show dress in overlap panel of laser cut fluorescent pastel organza it would be james turrell 's light sculpture in the guggenheim rotunda with its graduate and minimally compose hue
mr. lagerfeld be obviously limit by the surface and function of a dress
he also be keen to apply fendi 's skill especially with fur to his visual statement about light pattern and color
and light must mean weightlessness as well
he achieve this harmony throughout the show but you see it most vividly in the opening organza dress and those in which the grid pattern be do with shave fur mount on organza
typically they be do in three slightly different pattern in three solid color with the organza allow light to pass through
in his review of the turrell show peter schjeldahl of the new yorker note that this kind of installation trump a trend among contemporary artist favor by art institution toward clamorous hysterically clever spectacle and performance
well fashion be insanely clever at the moment too many novel fabric and crash color on what amount to conventional shape
and since designer have to knock out new collection every few month the subtle do not get traction
plus you need someone who can work as hard and think as fast as mr. lagerfeld
the prada show be definitely a big spectacle
that ' what editor and buyer have come to expect from miuccia prada
i love her spring man 's show in june if only because her creepy paradise theme make me wonder if she be slyly reference the novel of michel houellebecq
her woman 's show the other night feel a bit stingy in spite of the saturated color and the bobblehead blowup of illustration on dress which mirror those on the wall of the prada show space
for the presentation the company invite four muralist and two illustrator to create work around the theme of femininity power and multiplicity
accord to prada the concept originate from an interest in political wall art from mexico
in one sense the exuberant energy of the artwork it be do with the artist work together in the space be repeat in the clothes
but in another sense it feel as if the energy and spirit of feminine power be simply be mimic in the overloaded design with shape and fabric from prada 's archive
the most compelling design be sleeveless shift in viscose knit that evoke athletic wear the model wear soccer sock with sport sandal
they project an air of physical strength that most woman can relate to
but if ms. prada be broadly make a case for feminine power it be hard to see why she include cheerleader skirt and dress with bra design
my assumption be she know young woman will think they 're cute
at gucci frida giannini combine active wear style like track pant and flow beach tunic with art nouveau pattern inspire by erte
it be an interesting idea and it help to soften up the brand
but i keep wonder where one be mean to wear these clothes with their black mesh bra and stream tie they look too exposed for the city
a yacht
a modern apartment tower in shanghai
you need some imagination which i guess be not a bad thing
today in italy maxmara 's neominimalist pencil skirt in pearl beige linen with match cashmere sweater or etch look denim separate in plain tonal design the press note allude to a robert ryman monochrome painting look almost mod
they be not out of step with the time
on the contrary they seem a buffer
with so many dressy clothes on the runway one start to long for a simple summer dress
italian sportswear seem almost extinct
tod 's have hire alessandra facchinetti who start her career at prada to create sportswear and accessory
she make a small start on friday but it be excellent
there be lovely shirtdress in rust and pale pink cotton with a gather across the back a relaxed pantsuit in powder blue cotton distinctive leather and a jaunty version of the tod 's moccasin
donatella versace 's collection be populist luxury to the hilt a mere skip in her skyscraper platform and print flare skirt and bustier or mesh silk short with a ruched crinkle up the rear to the country 's tv personality
this too be not a bad thing
because with all her brawny instinct ms. versace be just react to her world
baghdad on a recent afternoon a pistol lay on munir haddad 's coffee table
a television sound off play professional wrestling
as a visitor enter he tell an assistant to remove the gun embarrass by its presence but then say he be never without a weapon even in the bathroom
he proudly point to a picture on the wall of himself stand next to anthony m. kennedy the united states supreme court justice and single out other photograph that line the wall of his office
there he be with emir ayatollah prince and ambassador
one stand out more than the others
in it a smile mr. haddad in a judge 's robe be peer up from a desk at a man whose face be unseen but whose identity be unmistakable saddam hussein
mr. haddad refer to himself as the guy who hang saddam hussein and while it be an ensemble cast who carry out the dictator 's execution he play a leading role
he preside over the trial and early one morning in 2006 in a drab room in a former military intelligence building mr. haddad read mr. hussein the execution order and then accompany him to the gallows
since then life for mr. haddad who as a shiite and a kurd be doubly oppress under a dictatorship that be dominate by a sunni arab elite have take on an unlikely trajectory
he be now in a private law practice have be push out of the judiciary like so many qualified civil servant by the shiite dominate government and replace he say by political party hack
he have carve out a late career niche and a new measure of fame defend countless sunnis jail on what he and human right activist say be spurious terrorism charge
i use to be a hero for the kurds and the shiites he say because of his role in mr. hussein 's trial
now i be a hero for the sunnis
he have also get rich
i have become a millionaire he say immodestly and then tick off the locale in which he say he own home beirut dubai barcelona germany
last week i buy a big house in holland he say
he say he have plenty of money but keep work because my wife and daughter want everything
his family live in the northern kurdish region where life be easy and safe than elsewhere in iraq and where he say his daughter recently call him ask for a $ 40,000 jeep
he say he would purchase it in baghdad and have it send north
as he speak he remember that he be due in beirut in a few day to try to sell a property there because he be worry that the war in syria will drive down real estate price
he call in an assistant and pull from his pocket a roll of $ 100 bill peel off a few and tell the young man to buy a plane ticket to beirut
mr. haddad 's story tell two truth of modern iraq the exile of educate technocrat from government service in favor of the patronage appointment of party align official who bend to the will of a powerful prime minister and the vast wealth that be available to the well connect in a society where the majority of citizen live in abject poverty
with violence in iraq increase the government have respond with some of its harsh crackdown yet on sunni area cast a wide net in pursuit of terrorism suspect arrest the innocent and guilty alike
which be good news of course for mr. haddad whose business be booming
he say his phone be constantly ring with call come in from anbar mosul and tikrit sunni area where young man be fill the jail
through mr. haddad 's effort abu hussein a sunni police officer in samarra be recently release from jail after be hold for a year on terrorism charge that he say be false and make by an anonymous informer
that be standard practice here
many iraqis some of whom use to fee tip to the american military in exchange for money now earn a living inform on their neighbor
the problem say human right activist and iraqi official be that the information be often false
after his arrest a friend tell abu hussein about mr. haddad
they say he be the one who defend the innocent people he recall

jerusalem this month mark 20 year since the signing of the first of the oslo accords between the state of israel and the palestine liberation organization
two decade after yitzhak rabin and yasir arafat stand on the white house lawn with president bill clinton israelis and palestinians be again in the midst of the umpteenth round of negotiation
despite these effort true peace seem as distant as it do before the secret talk in oslo be reveal to the world
the government of israel must admit that we make a mistake and declare that the oslo process have fail
only by officially annul the oslo accords will we have the opportunity to rethink the exist paradigm and hopefully lay the foundation for a more realistic modus vivendi between the jews and arabs of this region
despite attempt to rewrite recent history by fringe element the failure of the oslo framework can not be attribute to a lack of will and persistence by israel
what do not we try
we attempt direct negotiation third party mediator public conference and back channel talk
we stag withdrawal and unilateral disengagement establish joint israeli palestinian military patrol in gaza and deploy american train security force in the west bank
none of this work
the p.l.o. and later the palestinian authority never truly accept that israel as the national state and homeland of the jewish people be here to stay
no amount of impressive ceremony cosmetic change to the p.l.o. charter and palestinian doublespeak to western medium outlet about their commitment to peace be able to change this grim fact
to understand the mind boggle scope of oslo 's failure it be best to look at the statistic
accord to the organization b'tselem during the first palestinian intifada in 1987 six year before mr. rabin 's attempt to recast the archterrorist yasir arafat as a peacemaker 160 israelis be murder in palestinian terror attack
in the mid- to late-1990 as successive israeli government negotiate with the palestinians and mr. arafat and his crony repeatedly swear they be do their utmost to end terrorism 240 israelis be brutally kill as suicide bomb and other heinous terrorist act target unarmed civilian be unleash in every corner of our nation
thing do not get better after prime minister ehud barak make the palestinians an offer in 2000 that judge by his landslide defeat in the election a few month later be way beyond what most israelis support
between then and september 2010 1,083 israelis be murder by palestinian terrorist
the oslo process do not bring peace it bring increase bloodshed
we must end this farce by announce the immediate suspension of the accord
little impact would be feel by average israelis and palestinians
those who would suffer most would be full time negotiator like martin s. indyk and saeb erekat who would find themselves out of a job after 20 year of gainful employment in the peace process industry
what should replace oslo 's false promise
we should implement what i have call a three state solution
in the future the final status of the palestinians will be determine in a regional agreement involve jordan and egypt when the latter have be restabilized
all the region 's state must participate in the process of create a long term solution for the palestinian problem
in the short term the palestinians will continue to have autonomy over their civilian life while israel remain in charge of security throughout judea and samaria commonly refer to as the west bank
follow an initial period the arab resident of judea and samaria could continue to develop their society as part of an agreement involve israel and jordan
similarly gaza resident could work with israel and egypt to create a society that grant them full civil authority over their life in a manner that be acceptable to all side
most veteran of the peace process will mock this proposal protest that there be no way it would be accept by the palestinians
their argument may seem convincing today but as i often remind my critic our region be unpredictable
have you tell any middle east expert five year ago that two successive egyptian president would be depose and bashar al assad 's regime would be in the midst of a bloody civil war you too would have be mock
thing change
we can make them change
i be aware that even if the palestinians accept this plan we would still have to deal with a fundamentalist hamas regime in gaza and continue instability in egypt
no plan for israeli arab peace can be fully implement until these issue be resolve
in the short term israel 's only option be to manage this conflict by refuse to compromise when it come to the security of israeli citizen
at the same time our government should take all step possible to improve the economic well being of the palestinians
the dissolution of the oslo accords would serve as the official act validate what we already know that this fail framework be totally irrelevant in 2013
once the palestinians be ready to sit down and seriously discuss how our two people through this new paradigm could live side by side in peace and prosperity they would find willing partner across the political spectrum in israel
it may not be the utopian peace promise to all of us on that sunny day in september 1993 but in the harsh reality of the middle east this may be the best we can hope for and the sole realistic chance for our child to grow up in a world less violent than previous generation have have to endure

jacksonville fla. to measure the popularity and financial heft of the n.f.l. one need only look at the record amount pay for franchise the league 's ever rise television rating and the astronomical price for super bowl ticket
but one of the pure link can be find in the vast distribution center own by fanatic the nation 's large online seller of licensed sport merchandise
on the monday after the league 's opening weekend worker here scramble to unload trailer fill with everything from cap and jersey to shoot glass and doormat
half a football field away picker troll the aisle with scanner and cart to collect the good order overnight by fan across the country
merchandise carry the brand of the denver broncos the dallas cowboys the miami dolphins and the new orleans saints all team that win their opener be among the most popular item be drop into plastic box and send by conveyor belt to sorter who match the order
packer then put the merchandise in bag or box and send them to be load onto trailer destine for the airport
the day after n.f.l. kickoff be a fanatics moment say dennis matthews who run the 520,000-square foot building and bring in 75 extra worker that monday the start of a busy season that run through christmas
the moment be also one of the clear distillation of the willingness of fan to spend money to celebrate their team
it ' the bedrock of the business of fanatics which not only operate the online shop of the n.f.l. but also those of major league baseball the n.b.a. the n.h.l. nascar the pga tour and more than 150 college and pro team
fanatic 's success be base on fast access to more than one million item for professional and college team conference and league
the importance of n.f.l. sale to that business be a sign of the pre eminence of the country 's large league in the licensed sport good market which generate about $ 15 billion in sale a year
most licensed sport gear be still sell through traditional brick and mortar outlet
but those store also typically sell bat ball run shoe ice hockey skate and other gear leave them limit space for the jersey shirt and hat of even local team
often they stock only those of the most popular player
fanatic by contrast sell good for every player and team in every size and design
that mean a fan of say the seattle seahawks who live in miami can get a marshawn lynch jersey deliver to the front door as easily as a georgia bulldogs fan in texas can get a beer mug
fan can also find good for instant sensation like jeremy lin colin kaepernick and yasiel puig
emotion come and go quickly in sport so we need to give fan what they want say michael rubin the principal owner and executive chairman of fanatics
these so call displace fan make the bulk of the 15 million order that fanatics ship last year
the company however be eager to expand beyond them to meet an ambitious goal of generate at least $ 5 billion in annual revenue over the next decade from $ 1 billion this year
the goal be audacious give that the revenue from licensed sport merchandise grow by only 2.2 percent last year and be still 17 percent below its peak in 2006 accord to the international licensing industry merchandisers association
when the recession hit there be less disposable income and consumer be worried about gotta have instead of want to have say marty brochstein the senior vice president for industry relation and information at the association
the licensed product market do not go against consumer trend
still brochstein say that more than other retail item licensed sport merchandise be well suited to online shopping because many fan follow team in city far from where they live
young consumer be also more comfortable spend money on the internet so over time the share of online sale should grow a boon to fanatics he say 1 2 next page
i know you 're worried about the government shut down on oct. 1
who would not be
service suspend the nation 's credibility damage in the eye of the rest of the world
what serious person would want to let that happen
hehehehe
the better to plan your watchful worry here ' a tentative schedule of event monday sept. 23 senate go into session to consider the house bill that couple fund for the government with defunding obamacare
house be on vacation
i be serious
wednesday sept. 25 house come back from vacation
early
so stop carp
thursday sept. 26 senate be work its way toward a vote on the bill
whoop
somebody just object to something
may take a little while longer
friday sept. 27
the house take up a bill to raise the debt ceiling thus allow the government to continue pay its bill
which be tie to defunding obamacare and construction of the keystone xl pipeline
saturday sept. 28
the entire planet say keystone pipeline
sunday sept. 29 maybe a day or two before but around here the senate strip the obamacare part from the bill fund the government pass the bill and send it back to the house
sept. 30
last minute
clock be tick
oct. 1
best case scenario the house pass the bill in the wee small hour of the morning
everyone breathe a sigh of relief and move on to the question of whether the government 's ability to pay its debt should hinge on the construction of an oil pipe to the gulf coast
one thing at a time
about keep the government run in the end it will all be up to the house republicans pass a clean bill or dig in their heel and turn off the light
at that point house republicans must stand firm hold their ground and continue to listen to the american people say senator ted cruz of texas
house leader be less than thrilled with his advice
it be sort of like a guy who leave the alamo at the last minute yell victory or death as he gallop out of sight
some people believe that cruz be behind everything crazy go on in washington right now
this be possibly true if you work under the reasonable assumption that everything that happen in the world be base on a movie plot
the calgarian candidate
during the bush administration agent of the democratic party hatch a long term plot to ensure political ascendancy in the 21st century
their secret tool a canadian bear texas lawyer who they kidnap and brainwash
the mole we will call him t. suddenly emerge out of political obscurity in 2012 propel into the u.s. senate by member of the texas republican party who have also be secretly hypnotize by the democratic operative
the only sign of their transformation be a compulsion to say t. be the kind brave warm most wonderful human be i have ever know in my life over and over again
by the next year democrat decide they want to force the congressional republicans to behave with breathtaking irresponsibility
time to pull the trigger
while t. be stand alone at a washington costume party he be approach by a beautiful woman dress as the second amendment
and then
actually the house republicans have plenty of tea party patriot who be perfectly capable of be crazy all by themselves
representative ted yoho of florida tell the times 's ashley parker and jonathan weisman that he be ready to stick to his gun it only take one with passion look at rosa parks lech walesa martin luther king
i be mention this partly because it be not often you hear someone equate eliminate health insurance for the poor with rosa parks
also because i like to write representative ted yoho
the bill the house send to the senate on friday do not even make much sense
the defund obamacare part look as though it be write by squirrel
if it become law obamacare would actually continue to exist
at most the administration would be cripple in their early effort to get young uninsured americans to sign up for health coverage
this would presumably give the opposition more time to run those ad that show a young woman be give a pelvic exam by a monster uncle sam doll
and meanwhile the popular children 's health insurance program would be throw into chaos as well as payment to doctor who treat medicare patient
but what the heck
no sacrifice be too great when the cause be convince young adult that they should not buy health coverage
it ' an intense moment even by current political standard
when the republicans meet in conference on friday politico report representative mike kelly of pennsylvania compare john boehner to jesus i do not want this to be like palm sunday where we bring the speaker in on a little donkey and then next friday we crucify him
i know i be have a hard time get the image out of my mind too

atlanta steve stricker cut his pga tour play schedule nearly in half this year so he could be a more attentive husband and father and he find that a balanced life be worth pursue
in 12 tour start stricker 46 play well enough to qualify for the season end 30-man tour championship
the average number of start in 2013 by the other player in the field who do not divide their time between north america and europe be 24
stricker 's family value and fan outreach make him a pga tour commissioner 's dream but his stellar performance on a par down schedule be not necessarily ideal for the tour chief tim finchem
if stricker who be tie for seventh place after 36 hole at east lake golf club end up win the tour championship and collect the $ 10 million bonus after play in roughly one out of every three tournament win none and skip one of the first three playoff event what be to keep other star from turn their career into season long cameo
if 40 player would do it i would not like that finchem say
but that ' not go to happen
he probably have no cause to fret
stricker say i 've talk to a few player this year that have ask me a thing or two about my schedule and what i have be do and how come i come out and still play at a fairly high level at time
you know there ' some guy i think that think about it
and do it for me be the hard part
i think about it for a lot of year
but actually do it be another step
brandt snedeker the defend fedex cup champion look at stricker as an anomaly and not a trendsetter
there ' maybe three or four guy that can do that out here he say make clear he be not one of them
steve can put the club away for three week come out and play great snedeker say
i 'm a guy that kind of play into form
i need to be out here and play in competition and work myself into form that way
i can not seem to get the same kind of focus at home practicing
stricker 's one piece swing work to his advantage because it be easy to repeat even after a long layoff
it be like rid a bicycle whereas a swing with many move part be more like rid a unicycle
he have no hand in his golf swing snedeker say no hand in his putting
to thrive while play a part time schedule it help to have grow up in a climate where the season provide build in break
the wisconsin bear stricker say we do not play all year round so it ' like i feel like i need to get away from it at time
the primary factor in stricker 's decision be that he have two school age child both daughter who be grow up while he be go
five other player in the field have school age child include the divorce dad tiger woods who work his 16 tour start this year around visit with his daughter and son
matt kuchar have two boy who be still young enough to travel with him on the tour
as they grow old he say he could envision follow stricker 's lead
if it come down to it and i need to spend more time with family
yeah i could absolutely kuchar say
i think that ' the scenario that i can envision adopt that sort of schedule
since the start of the 2010 season stricker have miss one cut the 2012 players championship
his history of consistency be cite as another reason he be one of the few player who could thrive while play less
stricker be one of six player in this week 's field who do not miss a cut on tour this year
the others be kuchar woods sergio garcã­a jason day and adam scott
stricker can not separate the consistency in his professional life from the constancy in his personal life
he say i 've get a good balance in my life
i be happy with what i be do
i be comfortable with the decision i have make along the way and that go a lot
when you 're off the course life be in good shape make thing a little bit easy to do out here on the road
i have be a little bit easy on myself
i come out fresher
i come out with a better attitude
i be excited to be at each and every tournament
i think that ' be good
ultimately decide on a schedule be like decide on a club
if not fully commit to the choice the result be often regrettable
you have to believe a limited schedule be what ' right for you say jim furyk by way of explain why at age 43 with two school age child a repeatable swing a cold weather background consistent result and financial security he can not see himself play a dozen event a year any time soon
i think strick be at the point he know what be right for him so he find a way to be very competitive at 12 event furyk say where if you say in your mind i really should be play 20 but i be go to play 12 it do not work
furyk who have 22 tour start this year add i think the guy be interested in what he ' do
they 're kind of jealous because he ' play so well do so
what i admire be not the fact that he ' play 12 event but that he kind of figure out what be best for his family and go ahead and do it

the weekend broadcast of all thing consider be head west
at an underutilized npr office here the famed afternoon program will reboot itself on saturday with a new host arun rath a new time zone and even a rearrangement of its brassy theme music
npr official have bill it as a rare chance for a legacy radio program previously base in washington with the rest of the public radio organization to rethink what it be and do and let listener decide if the change sound good
the timing be somewhat awkward since npr be try to balance its budget by cut about 10 percent of its work force initially through voluntary buyout and if necessary through layoff
the plan announce last week have be demoralize for some employee but the show must go on include weekend all thing consider for which mr. rath be hire away from the pbs program frontline in july
for npr all thing consider be one of its two flagship the other be morning edition
npr say about 12 million people hear at least a part of the weekday program on a typical week 2 million hear the short weekend program
guy raz be the host of the one hour weekend edition until the end of last year when he move over to the ted radio hour
while jacki lyden and others fill in npr executive talk at length about how to adjust the show over the long term
geographic diversity be very important to us say ellen mcdonnell npr 's executive editor of news programming
hurricane sandy focus our attention on how we would broadcast if there be a situation where we be incapacitate at our washington facility

the organization open the cavernous facility it call npr west in 2002 and for a while originate two program from here include day to day a well regard newsmagazine
but the program be cancel amid a round of budget cutback in 2008 and 2009
npr west have remain home to the organization 's southern california bureau and to a number of morning edition staff member include that program 's co host renee montagne but the move of weekend all thing consider have bring more energy
it ' good to be out west say mr. rath who have yet to unpack all the box in his new office
we 'll have more story from the west more voice from the west he say
but the core value of the program be not go to change
kevin roderick the founder and editor of l.a. observed which cover the city 's medium and politics say i 'm always a little wary when a national news outlet say it ' go to flavor its usual fare with more l.a. or west coast perspective

that be the house republicans brilliant plan in their last ditch effort to block implementation of the affordable care act
it be a plan that threaten to grind the government to a halt and wreak havoc on the economy
if they can not take over washington they will shut it down
it ' their way or no way
all or nothing
this be what have become of a party hijack by zealot
it would be tempting to blame all republicans for this absurdity but that would be unfair
there be still republicans who be interested in good governance but they 're be drag to the nether region of nonsensical policy make by young more ideological member of congress many from safely gerrymandered district that form virtual echo chamber of irrationality
the old guard have warn against the recklessness of the tactic of far right house republicans
john mccain tell cnn on thursday in the united states senate we will not repeal or defund obamacare
we will not
and to think we can be not rational
senator richard burr republican of north carolina say of the house republicans strategy of threaten a government shutdown to force the defunding of obamacare i think it ' the dumb idea i have ever hear of
senator jim risch republican of idaho have say there be not anybody that think that obamacare be go to get defunded
it can not happen
he add it be as impossible as anything can possibly be in washington d.c.

even karl rove strike a rational tone in a wall street journal op ed publish online wednesday evening say any strategy to repeal delay or replace the law must have a credible chance of succeed or affect broad public opinion positively

on friday house republicans and two democrats pass a spending resolution that would cut all funding for the health care law
this bill have no chance of pass in the senate but that be not the point
the point be to gum up the work and to force vulnerable democrats in heavily red state to go on record as refuse to defund the health care law
these republican be not afraid the law will fail as much as they 're afraid that it will succeed and become part of the fabric of the collective conscience and bad yet be a clear legacy victory for president obama
there be no more bitter tea party loss than a perceive obama victory
the president be the focal point of the party 's frustration
tea party representative have be send to washington with a singular mission obstruct obama
these kamikaze member of congress have make the house of representative a house of horror where smart thinking be smother where rabble demand respect
these be member of congress from district where the distrust of the federal government and the distaste for this president be blind
some of them twist poll result to buttress their bitterness
they point to poll show that most americans oppose the law as fuel for their fight
what they neglect to reveal be that a sizable portion of those who oppose the law do so because they do not think it go far enough not because it go too far
a may cnn/orc poll find that 43 percent of americans favor the law while 54 percent oppose it
but it also find that of those poll 16 percent oppose the law because they think that it be not liberal enough
put another way 59 percent of americans support the law or want it to be more liberal
furthermore a poll release this week by the pew research center find that of the 53 percent of americans who say they disapprove of the law the percentage who want elect official who oppose the law to try to make it work as well as possible be large than the percentage who want them to try to make it fail
the american people be not on the far right 's side in battle
house republicans be on a quixotic mission
sometimes in a fight you just have to know when your opponent have get the better of you limp home and live to fight another day
but the house republicans prefer a twist last stand view face sure defeat in a blaze of glory and be remember for stand up for what you believe in
if only their stance be honorable
there be no glory in this
this be petty and small
this be vindictive and vainglorious

it be herald as the best manage bank with dimon the best chief executive
now that same bank run by that same man have become a piã±ata for government regulator even with thursday 's settlement there be still a half dozen investigation under way
let me suggest a few possible reason the bank be never as well manage at it appear
on one level jpmorgan raise the broad question of whether any of the big sprawl systemically important bank can truly be manage
but there be also issue that be particular to jpmorgan
the fact that the london whale trade be be mark differently by two area of the bank suggest that something be seriously awry
ditto the investigation regulator open last september result in a cease and desist order a few month later into whether jpmorgan have appropriate safeguard against money laundering
that kind of compliance be part of the blocking and tackling of the banking business
only now be the bank hire thousand of compliance officer who should have be in place year ago
unlucky timing
american banker ask an interesting question the other day what would have happen if the london whale trade have take place in 2009 rather than 2012
almost certainly the government 's response would not have be nearly as severe
the reason be simple say the newspaper
the government then be more worried about harm the system and do not want to potentially upset market by assess large fine
another reason though be that jpmorgan for all its trouble remain immensely profitable and huge with well over $ 2 trillion in asset
the government can make an example out of it without jeopardize it
the regulator be finally get serious
yes it ' true despite point out numerous lapse by senior management at jpmorgan the government once again name no name of senior executive and indict two relatively small fry for their action in the london whale trade
the regulator still have a way to go though they be unusually candid in describe the lapse by the top executive of jpmorgan
but look how far they have come
what one hear be that there be very little negotiating about the size of the whopping fine
and the securities and exchange commission require an admission of guilt as part of the settlement which be a very big deal
let 's pause and doff our cap to jed rakoff the federal judge who first start complain about settlement that do not acknowledge guilt and whose reasoning appear to have persuade the s.e.c.
the passage of time have allow the regulator to get their act together say my friend dan alpert managing partner at westwood capital and the author of the come book the age of oversupply
it ' encouraging for instance to see the office of the comptroller of the currency shed its former reputation as the bank best friend in washington and get tough on the institution it oversee
it ' important to remember why bank be regulate so closely
it ' not about punishment or satisfaction
it ' about ensure that the bank be be run soundly
bank be not like other company a big bank failure can have enormous economic consequence as we saw in 2008
i think the key to safe and sound banking be to hold the board and senior management accountable say karen petrou the manage partner of federal financial analytics
this be first time of which i be aware it ' be do
she add largely because so much else go unpunished jpmorgan end up hold the bag
but better late than never petrou say

do anyone kidnap poet
not for money certainly
we try to think of all the possible swindle that this could be and come up with none
still it be hard not to be nervous or suspicious
not to wonder what be actually go on
who river and whisper be
whether any of the other poet would show
i have no way of find out
the friday of the dinner a warm new york summer day where the city move in slow motion it be hard to think of anything else besides river and whisper and poem
at 4:30 dress in what i hop be a suitably poetic outfit a long dress that make me look as though i could write more than one good poem i meet my husband for a drink at the half king an appropriately literary bar near the dinner destination

we enter an elevator that go right to the third floor where we be greet by a tall blond woman who have a clipboard
she do not say enter but she could have
the room be modern and overly bright
if it be possible to have too much daylight this room do
the space be small and well staffed with server and helper of various kind and a bar full of enough champagne for us all to drink more than a bottle or two
poet begin drink immediately and attentive server make sure that we be never without a full glass
a long table hold enough finger food to serve three time our number
we find out quickly with the help of the clipboard woman that river and whisper be two
we be all informed that we be never to know their real name
their anonymity be this contest 's only rule
river a nervous asian man in a t shirt walk around to greet us with whisper a thin attractive white woman much tall than river
river be small and jumpy
whisper hold onto him tenaciously
whisper be both quiet and bold
they walk through the room to greet all of us in a shy tentative way emphasize that their anonymity be as important as the poem themselves
whisper would stop suddenly seize with unexpected passion and feel the need to lean over and kiss river in a way that be hard for us nervous poet to ignore

but law enforcement play no role
the return be facilitate by the art loss register a london base company that over the last two decade have evolve into a little notice but increasingly integral part of art investigation around the world
the brainchild of julian radcliffe an oxford educate former risk consultant who speak of once spy for british intelligence the register help fill a gap void billion of dollar worth of art be steal every year accord to an f.b.i. estimate but law enforcement have too few resource to prioritize find it
for mr. radcliffe whose other company help recover steal construction equipment this present a natural opportunity
since it begin 22 year ago the register have develop one of the most extensive database of steal art in the world enable it to recover more than $ 250 million worth of art earn fee from insurer and theft victim
along the way the company have draw criticism from those who say its hardball tactic push ethical and sometimes legal boundary
even so the register continue to count law enforcement agent among its supporter
to me they 're very important a very useful tool say mark fishstein the new york city police department 's art cop
mr. radcliffe 's company operate in the dim recess of the art world where the prevalence of theft fakery and work of murky provenance have give rise to many business that promise to help client navigate this lucrative but largely unregulated market
but for the register despite its official sounding name and pivotal role as a monitor profit have not come easily and the company 's future look increasingly cloudy threaten a core player in the recovery of steal art
mr. radcliffe say that he hop the registry will break even this year but that it have lose money for the last six and have stay afloat only thanks to his cash infusion
now the company be lose talent too
during the past year two key employee resign additionally the company 's general counsel christopher a. marinello who have be as much a public face of the company as mr. radcliffe say he be leave at the end of this month with plan to start a rival business
among the incident that have draw criticism the register mislead a client who want to check the provenance of a painting before he purchase it tell him it be not steal when in fact it be so that he would buy it and unwittingly help the company collect a fee for its retrieval
it have be know to pay middleman and informer for lead on steal work a practice that trouble some in law enforcement who say that it can incite theft
and the company often behave like a bounty hunter charge fee of as much as 20 percent of a work 's value for its return
these fee do not bother the insurance company and other client that hire the register to find a work
but the company have approach people and museum with whom it have no relationship
in several case people say the register contact them tell them of a lead on a steal work then refuse to divulge any information until the subject agree to pay a fee
official at the musee des beaux arts in orleans france for example say that the register approach the museum in 2003 assert that it have information about an alfred sisley painting that have be steal from the museum
the company say it could retrieve the work if the museum agree to its fee
unable to afford the payment the museum call the police instead
the work be never recover
sometimes we have to deal with the fact that under french law we could charge them say corinne chartrelle the deputy for a french law enforcement unit that track steal art
she be not involve in the orleans case but say she know of similar instance where the register have try to leverage its knowledge to extract a fee
they be keep information to themselves she say 1 2 3 4 next page
a rancher in brazil 's amazon have be sentence to 30 year in prison for order the 2005 killing of an american nun and environmental activist dorothy stang

the use of biological marker like fingerprint face and iris to identify people be rapidly move from science fiction to reality
apple 's late iphone which go on sale this week can be unlock with a fingerprint
user of android smartphones can unlock their device with a glance
and the department of homeland security be develop facial recognition technology that would allow it to pinpoint criminal and suspect in large crowd of people with closed circuit camera
once so expensive that it be use only by the military or high tech company biometric technology have become so commonplace that even some school and hospital be use it
its adoption could make sensitive information more secure than conventional identification card or password which can be easily forget lose or hack
but it also have the potential to undermine privacy which have be greatly compromise by recent revelation about government surveillance of phone and internet communication
in fact biometrics be not as safe as be often think
a 2010 report from the national research council conclude that such system be inherently fallible because they identify people within certain degree of certainty and because biological marker be relatively easy to copy
for example people leave their fingerprint on everything they touch which make those fingerprint available to any determine spy or law enforcement agent
expert have show that fingerprint and other marker can be copy give hacker and thief access to private information
and once compromise fingerprint can not be reset like password or replace like passport
if proper safeguard be not put in place the use of some biometrics like facial recognition technology can also be use to conduct intrusive surveillance of individual or group of people by government and private company
use facial recognition software to match database of photo with image from security camera in public space and private building can help law enforcement agency spot and track dangerous criminal
but the same technology can just as easily be abuse to target political activist or protester
retailer could use such system to snoop on their customer shopping behavior so that they could later target specific ad and offer to those customer
facebook already use software to determine whether photo that user upload to the site contain the image of their friend though the company do let user opt out of the system
even as the use of such technology have expand rapidly there have be little public debate about its use
most federal and state law do not directly address the collection and use of biological marker by business and the government
some lawmaker like senator al franken democrat of minnesota have ask government agency and company like apple and facebook to explain how they use biometrics
but congress must do more by enact legislation that govern how this technology be use to make sure it do not compromise privacy right

have agree this week to pay $ 920 million in fine to resolve federal and international investigation into its $ 6 billion london whale trading loss jpmorgan chase have reportedly reach some closure in the case and be ready in the word of its chief executive jamie dimon to move forward in a process of simplify the bank
while jpmorgan may feel some closure there be scant closure for the american public which deserve accountability for bank recklessness that continue to endanger the economy and which understand that without accountability true financial reform be impossible
under the settlement jpmorgan will pay fine that amount to very little for a bank that earn $ 6.5 billion in the last quarter alone
it have also admit to violate security law on corporate governance and internal control
the securities and exchange commission rightly extract the admission as a condition of settlement
but unless federal prosecutor follow up with charge against the bank or its officer under the sarbanes oxley accounting law or other federal statute those concession be mostly an embarrassment
they be not in themselves punishment for past improper conduct and be unlikely to deter future bad behavior
the bank have escape more serious charge of lie to investor and regulator evidence of which be present in an earlier congressional investigation and be even broach in the settlement narrative of event with regulator make reference to senior management withhold information from the bank 's board and from regulator
if board member and regulator be mislead it stand to reason that investor be also wrongly keep in the dark
as for the senior management no action be take against any individual and no executive be name in the settlement
but five be identify by title some of whom be still at the bank include the former chief financial officer who be now a vice chairman and mr. dimon
the s.e.c. as well as federal prosecutor and the f.b.i. in manhattan be reportedly still investigate the loss
unfortunately their record in pursue big bank and top banker be poor
mr. dimon say this year that he exhort the bank 's executive and manager to be forthcoming and diligent in face up to the london whale loss as they come to light
that response miss the point executive have to be hold responsible for the disastrous result that arise out of bad management
the london whale settlement open the door to the possibility of other investigation that can lead to real accountability but whether regulator and prosecutor will follow through remain a question

san francisco
with a huge lead and the rival skipper jimmy spithill swear at the helm of oracle team usa 's yacht emirates team new zealand look as if it have finally manage to end a decade of frustration and collective soul search to bring the america 's cup back to the island nation where sailor be superstar
no such luck
instead it turn into yet another day on san francisco bay that stretch the limit of credulity and the kiwis patience and end with them still yes still need just one victory to win the auld mug
they lead 8 3
it be tough enough at this stage to beat the improve oracle team which be gain in speed and confidence but the need to beat oracle and the bay area wind deities be make the task even harder
at least one race be postpone because of too much wind on tuesday wednesday and thursday
but friday 's obstacle be too little wind and although team new zealand be ahead by close to a mile at one late stage the race that would have win them the cup be abandon with their ac72 near the penultimate mark because it have exceed the 40-minute time limit
it ' better to be lucky than good be not it say ben ainslie oracle 's tactician
we be obviously star down the barrel of defeat
when the race be stop the kiwis be perhaps less than three minute of sail time away from the finish and a national celebration
but like gatsby and the green light at the end of daisy 's dock they be leave star across the water
it ' obviously tough on the guy they put a lot into the race say dean barker team new zealand 's soft spoken skipper and helmsman
we be not think about the time limit until we realize in that second downwind leg that it be go to become an issue
i think it ' about be able to put it behind you
you can cry or you can laugh and get on with it
and we do
we get back into it
so they do with barker and the kiwis hold off the ultra aggressive spithill to win the start in the next race and then round the first mark with a slight lead
but the rest of this wind shift mood shift race day belong to oracle
the american team take the lead farther down the leg after use its starboard advantage to get a penalty on team new zealand as the two big ac72 jibed and race official rule that team new zealand still out in front do not leave oracle quite enough room to cross unencumbered
at the bottom mark oracle outwit and outmaneuver the kiwis again round with a 20-second advantage and then build on it during the upwind leg and finally cross the finish line 1 minute 24 second in front and just to be clear on a muddle of a day well within the 40-minute time limit at 27 minute and 20 second
i 'm speechless and it ' hard for me to be speechless say ken read the former america 's cup helmsman of the kiwis
i can not feel bad for these guy
time limit be a staple of sailboat racing and america 's cup race be call off for exceed the time in 1977 and 1983
but bob fisher an america 's cup historian from britain say there have never be a race call off with a team need just one victory to win
fisher term the 40-minute time limit a bit ridiculous
it be a bit low for a light air race around that track he say of san francisco bay
they be do at time 20 knot and plus and if they could not finish in that it do not give them much of a break do it
iain murray the regatta director and former america 's cup sailor say that the team have unanimously agree to the 40-minute limit last year which barker acknowledge through the pain
it would have be nice to have another 10 minute barker say
look today be a very unusual day on san francisco bay

los angeles california be challenge the historic status of american citizenship with measure to permit noncitizen to sit on jury and monitor poll for election in which they can not vote and to open the practice of law even to those here illegally
it be the leading edge of a national trend that include grant driver license and in state tuition to illegal immigrant in some state and that suggest legal residency could evolve into an appealing option should immigration legislation fail to produce a path to citizenship
with 3.5 million noncitizen who be legal permanent resident in california some view the change as an acknowledgment of who be live here and the need to require some public service of them
but the new law raise profound question about which right and responsibility rightly belong to citizen over resident
what be more basic to our society than be able to judge your fellow citizen ask jessica a. levinson a professor at loyola law school refer to jury service
we 're absolutely go to the bedrock of thing here and stretch what we use to think of as limit
one new state law allow legal permanent resident to monitor poll during election help translate instruction and offer other assistance to vote citizen
and immigrant who be bring into the country illegally by their parent will be able to practice law here something no other state allow
in many way the new measure underscore the lock democrats have over the state capitol where they hold an overwhelming majority in both house
gov. jerry brown a democrat sign the poll worker legislation this month and have indicate his approval of the other bill
many of the change include grant driver license to unauthorized immigrant pass with overwhelming support and the backing of several republicans
state legislature across the country approve a host of new immigrant friendly measure this year a striking change from just three year ago when many state appear poise to follow arizona 's lead to enact strict law aim at curb illegal immigration
more than a dozen state now grant illegal immigrant in state college tuition and nine state and the district of columbia also allow them to obtain driver license
with an estimate 2.5 million illegal immigrant live in california more than in any other state in the country some say the state have no choice but to find additional way to integrate immigrant
it ' a recognition that how people be live and work in their community may trump their formal legal status say hiroshi motomura an immigration law professor at the university of california los angeles
there be an argument that in part of california a jury without a legal permanent resident be not really a jury of peer
some view citizenship as the final consecration of complete integration but this say let 's take who we have and get them to participate in our civil institution

early this month the state supreme court suggest during a hearing that lawmaker could create a law to address the case of sergio garcia who be bring to the united states illegally as a child
mr. garcia have meet every other requirement to become a licensed lawyer
within day legislation be approve to allow immigrant who be bring here illegally as minor to obtain law license with just three oppose vote
but the bill to allow noncitizen to sit on jury have prove more controversial
several newspaper editorial have urge mr. brown to veto it
rocky chã¡vez a republican assemblyman from northern san diego county say that allow noncitizen to serve on a jury would make it hard to uphold american standard of law
what we call domestic violence be appropriate in other country so the question become how do we enforce our own social norm mr. chã¡vez say
he add that grant more privilege would weaken immigrant desire to become citizen
once we erase all these distinction what ' next
what be go to convince someone it be essential to get citizenship

washington the obama administration 's potentially pathbreaking proposal for carbon emission limit on new power plant will face political and legal challenge from opponent who argue that the technology need have not be close to be prove as the law require
the draft rule be announce on friday at the national press club by gina mccarthy the administrator of the environmental protection agency
but to protect industry from pie in the sky requirement current law limit what rule the agency can make
e.p.a. rule sometimes demand technological advancement but the goal that the agency establish have to be meet by technique that exist law describe as adequately demonstrate
the proposal would limit new ga fire power plant to 1,000 pound of carbon dioxide emission per megawatt hour and new coal plant to 1,100 pound of carbon dioxide
industry official say the average advanced coal plant currently emit about 1,800 pound of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour
a megawatt hour be a little more than a typical american household us in a month
once the rule be in place new plant would be require to capture carbon dioxide from the smokestack and sequester it underground
official say the regulation could be complete by the fall of 2014
but utility say law govern underground disposal be not write with carbon dioxide in mind and sequestration be in a legal quagmire
three system of carbon capture be in various stage of development
the most common be to convert coal into a mixture of hydrogen carbon monoxide which in this context be a fuel not a pollutant and carbon dioxide and to recover the carbon dioxide at two different stage
another method demonstrate by the utility american electric power in recent year at its mountaineer plant in west virginia be to burn coal conventionally and use an ammonia process to grab the carbon dioxide out of the flue ga
and if coal be burn in nearly pure oxygen the flue gas be nearly pure carbon dioxide
in the last few day ms. mccarthy have refer to several early stage carbon capture project as a sign that industry can build the need equipment
in testimony on wednesday before the house energy and power subcommittee ms. mccarthy cite four such project
she tell reporter on friday that the draft rule be base on technology that be already enter the market and be construct in plant today
but the four she refer to in the committee hearing range from under construction to plan
none of them would sequester the carbon dioxide and all would sell it
the close to opening be the southern company 's kemper county plant in mississippi which will convert coal to gas and then filter out some of the carbon dioxide reduce emission by about 65 percent
but the plant at $ 5 billion be $ 1 billion over budget
southern company say in a statement on friday that the plant 's economics be peculiar to its location and not a national model
its capture carbon will be sell for use in the oil field where it help force more oil to the surface
but most power plant be not in area where they can sell their carbon dioxide
revis w. james director of the energy technology assessment center at the electric power research institute say that before a technology could be consider commercially demonstrate you 'd need kemper to be operational and a couple more kempers and have the kink work out
carbon capture and sequestration he say be unlikely to be competitive unless natural ga price increase by 100 to 150 percent and the construction of nuclear plant be rule out
ms. mccarthy also refer to three project that would sell carbon dioxide to the oil industry a coal plant in saskatoon saskatchewan the boundary dam project where the provincial utility plan to rebuild a small 45-year old unit to capture carbon dioxide the texas clean energy project 15 mile west of odessa where the builder hope to soon break ground and hydrogen energy california propose for the oil field of kern county
as the price of oil have rise so have the value of carbon dioxide to oil drillers
the value as a carbon reduction mechanism be unclear though because the result be to produce more oil all of which will be burn produce more carbon emission
e.p.a. official say that a carbon emission rule would push improvement in the technology
two decade ago when the agency require technology to reduce emission of a different pollutant nitrogen oxide a smog precursor that too be expensive and not thoroughly demonstrate but today it be routine they say
the big carbon capture project to date be at the american electric power 's mountaineer plant in new haven w.va
but nicholas k. akins the company 's chairman and chief executive say that technology be definitely not ready for prime time
mountaineer be a pilot project
equip the whole plant would have cost $ 1 billion he say and drive up cost per kilowatt hour by 60 to 80 percent
the company eventually shut down the effort because it could not recover the cost from its customer
and injection of carbon dioxide into the earth be only possible because it be classify as a research project he say
mr. akins and other industry executive say that a rule govern new coal plant would have little impact because of the low price of natural ga
no one in their right mind be go to start a coal unit at this point he say
but they fear it will become a precedent for limit on exist plant
rule on smog mercury and other pollutant be accelerate the retirement of many old coal plant and a rule on carbon dioxide would hit many more they say
many of the environmental group that applaud the e.p.a. 's propose standard appear to agree
they take pain to note that coal plant also emit a variety of smog form and toxic chemical and that suppress new plant because of their carbon dioxide emission would have the effect of reduce the other emission too
on the other side senator mitch mcconnell who be from coal dependent kentucky promise to prevent the measure from be carry out
the president 's decision today be an escalation of the war on coal he say

he say he do not want all that money
i just want to take out $ 1,000 he say

he get both
but now mr. sanchez must document the past he have try to leave behind in an 11-page application for a photo identification card issue by a city agency that be responsible for ferret out organize crime
he be one of hundred of food worker who have come under scrutiny in recent year by the agency the new york city business integrity commission not because of any known tie to mob boss but simply because they work for a company in hunts point
the commission which regulate the wholesale meat seafood and produce market operate on city own land in hunts point have increasingly look outside those market to company on private property nearby
since 2009 the agency have register 54 company in the area adjoin the market and have collect application for background check and identification card from their employee

the application and other requirement have be a sore point for the hunts point wholesale produce market which recently cite the commission 's regulatory effort as a reason that it be unable to come to term with the city on a new long term lease
commission official say they start focus on worker outside the public market in 2009 after a state court decision mandate equal treatment of company inside and outside the market wall
they add that they step up their effort this year after receive an anonymous complaint that many company have not comply with the registration and identification card

since 2011 the agency have close three company outside the market with tie to the genovese crime family and a fourth company whose owner be find to have embezzle from a former employer
require the application be a balancing act she say one that require us to look at the information collect in the most narrowly focused way so that corruptive influence be keep at bay business need be meet and a clear path to employment for those who need it most be provide

beijing for almost two year hacker base in shanghai go after one foreign defense contractor after another at least 20 in all
their target accord to an american cybersecurity company that monitor the attack be the technology behind the united states clear lead in military drone
i believe this be the large campaign we have see that have be focus on drone technology say darien kindlund manager of threat intelligence at the company fireeye base in california
it seem to align pretty well with the focus of the chinese government to build up their own drone technology capability
the hacking operation conduct by a group call comment crew be one of the most recent sign of the ambition of china 's drone development program
the government and military be strive to put china at the forefront of drone manufacturing for their own use and for export and have make an all out push to gather domestic and international technology to support the program
foreign ministry official have say china do not sanction hack and be itself a victim but another american cybersecurity company have track member of comment crew to a building of the people 's liberation army outside shanghai
china be now dispatch its own drone into potential combat arena
every major arm manufacturer in china have a research center devote to drone accord to chinese and foreign military analyst
those company have show off dozen of model to potential foreign buyer at international air show
chinese official this month send a drone near dispute island administer by japan debate use a weaponize drone last year to kill a criminal suspect in myanmar and sell homemade drone resemble the predator an american model to other country for less than a million dollar each
meanwhile online photograph reveal a stealth combat drone the lijian or stealth sword in a runway test in may.
military analyst say china have long try to replicate foreign drone design
some chinese drone appear at recent air show have closely resemble foreign one
ian m. easton a military analyst at the project 2049 institute in virginia say cyberespionage be one tool in an extensive effort over year to purchase or develop drone domestically use all available technology foreign and domestic
chinese engineer and official have do reverse engineering study open source material and debrief american drone expert who attend conference and other meeting in china
this can save them year of design work and mistake mr. easton say
the chinese military have not release statistic on the size of its drone fleet but a taiwan defense ministry report say that as of mid-2011 the chinese air force alone have more than 280 drone unit and analyst say the other branch have thousand which mean china 's fleet count be second only to the 7,000 or so of the united states

the military significance of china 's move into unmanned system be alarming say a 2012 report by the defense science board a pentagon advisory committee
china 's domestic security apparatus whose $ 124 billion official budget this year be large than that of the military be also keenly interested in drone which raise question about the potential use of drone for surveillance and possibly even attack inside china include in restive area of xinjiang and tibet
drone technology conference here be attend by both military and domestic security official
an international conference on nonmilitary drone be schedule to take place in beijing from sept. 25 to 28
a signal moment in china 's drone use come on sept. 9 when the navy send a surveillance drone near the dispute diaoyu islands which japan administer and call the senkakus
japanese interceptor jet scramble to confront it
this be the first time china have ever deploy a drone over the east china sea
the chinese defense ministry say regular drill have take place at relevant area in the east china sea which conform to relevant international law and practice
the drone appear to be a bzk-005 a long range aircraft use by the chinese navy that make its public debut in 2006 at china 's air show in zhuhai say an american official
mr. easton say deploy the drone near dispute water and island be very much a first for china and have catch japanese official off guard
i think this be really just the beginning of a much broad trend we 're go to see for china to increase its ability to monitor the east china sea and the western pacific beyond the philippines and to increase the operational envelope of their strike capability he say
the chinese military with its constant focus on potential war over taiwan and an eye on china 's grow territorial dispute be at the vanguard of prepare drone for use in maritime situation
that be unlike the united states which have use drone to hunt and kill suspect terrorist and guerrilla fighter mostly in pakistan and afghanistan
american drone be not design to enter into contest or deny air space mr. easton say
so they would be unable to fight in any conflict with china
china on the other hand be build drone also call unmanned aerial vehicle precisely to operate in contest space
it ' a very useful instrument for safeguard maritime sovereignty say xu guangyu a retire major general and director of the china arms control and disarmament association
china will gradually step up its use of u.a.v. 's in this area

santa monica calif.
it would seem to be a good time to own an electric car in santa monica
from the charging station dot around town to the dedicated public parking space all provide at no cost by the city santa monica have roll out the welcome mat for electric car
but even here in this wealthy environmentally conscious city of 90,000 west of los angeles only a core group of owner have switch from traditional gasoline powered car
less than 4 percent of registered car run only on battery power accord to an analysis by the industry researcher edmunds.com of data from r.l. polk which record vehicle registration nationwide
hybrid which run on some combination of gasoline and battery power account for 15.5 percent the data say but many of those be traditional hybrid which do not require a plug in cord for recharge
rosemary regalbuto a santa monica resident buy a ford c max energi plug in hybrid this year for the two mile commute between her home and her office where she be chief executive of meals on wheels west
she want to reduce emission and spend less on ga but say that go fully electric be too risky especially for long work trip to downtown los angeles or city like santa clarita about 30 mile north
i would not necessarily be able to plug in on the other end she say
the car get 22 mile on a charge

for now automaker push to sell electric car have spark sale to early adopter but have fail to encourage mainstream consumer say jean franã§ois tremblay director at ernst young 's global automotive center
high sticker price even after a $ 7,500 tax credit short range and a lack of a national network of charge station be among the reason consumer be shy away from buy electric vehicle in favor of gasoline engine mr. tremblay say
for automaker the reluctance underscore how difficult it will be for them to meet strict federal and state mandate on fuel efficiency and pollution over the next 12 year
california 's law to reduce pollution for example require that 15.4 percent of automaker vehicle be power by alternative technology by 2025
as a result some automaker be produce electric vehicle just for california and a handful of other state
that include the electric version of the honda fit and fiat 500
and the federal government be require automaker to nearly double their vehicle average fuel economy by 2025
santa monica would seem like the ideal market
with an average household income of more than $ 71,000 its resident can afford the high upfront cost of electric car
city official have also try to make it easy to own them
four year ago even before the all electric nissan leaf be release the city begin a push to install public charging station at its parking lot shopping center and street downtown where it offer electricity free
today santa monica have 42 charging station with 80 more on the way by early next year
the city offer free parking to any vehicle display the state issue sticker that allow access to the car pool lane and the santa monica city government have also make it easy for resident to install charger at home by waive electric permit fee and speed up the approval process
we 've work to make it an over the counter process say dean kubani director of the city 's office of sustainability and the environment
the city know as a surfing haven also have one of the strong environmental record in the nation
in 1982 it create one of the first municipal curbside recycling program and it have lead other california city in a ban on plastic bag at drugstore and supermarket
santa monica have a long history of progressive politics mr. kubani say
it ' attract the type of person who tend to support environmental policy
the effort to encourage electric car ownership be bear some fruit here compare with the rest of the nation
the city 's registration rate of 3.6 percent for all electric car be the high in the united states outside of two town in silicon valley
about 90 percent of the municipal fleet run on alternative fuel include natural ga biodiesel and battery power 1 2 next page

east rutherford n.j.
the 0 2 giants find a ray of hope this week in the knowledge that their last such start come in 2007 when they sweep their next six game and go on to win super bowl xlii.
the belief that they can repeat such a turnaround could hinge on how they fare sunday against quarterback cam newton and the carolina panthers an opponent they be meet at a familiar time and place
the giants travel to charlotte n.c. with a 1 1 record in their third regular season game last year
they use a 36 7 thumping of the panthers to start a torrid stretch in which they win five of six game
that help lead to a win record 9 7 but not a playoff berth
there have to be a sense of urgency defensive end justin tuck say of this year 's slow start because we be not get those two game back
any sense of dejã vu surround sunday 's kickoff in charlotte end for the giants with the absence of run back andre brown
against the panthers on sept. 20 2012 brown carry 20 time for 113 yard and 2 touchdown
he and the rest of the giants offense play the best possible defense against newton by keep him off the field the giants dominate the time of possession keep the ball for 36 minute 10 second
this year brown be on injure reserve until mid november with a broken leave leg
the giants have miss his hard charge style
with their age offensive line struggle to create run lane they have 33 rush attempt for 73 yard a meager 36.5 yard per game
it appear the defense will also be lack a key figure cornerback corey webster be list as doubtful after miss friday 's practice with a hip injury
aaron ross be expect to make his first start for the giants since super bowl xlvi to close the 2011 season
he leave as a free agent to sign with jacksonville but play only one year with the jaguars before he be release
ross say that he have not be tell he would start but that he would embrace the opportunity
i love to play
i love to compete
i be a fierce competitor he say
any time i have a chance to go out there i be excited
ross draft by the giants in the first round in 2007 say he have always be ready to rejoin the lineup
he say of his study habit it ' the same as it be every week
i go in prepare like i be a starter because you never know what be go to happen
ross hurry into action in the season open 36 31 loss at the dallas cowboys when prince amukamara collide with safety ryan mundy and sustain a concussion
ross hold up well against tony romo the cowboys elusive passer
we 're not look for any kind of letdown safety antrel rolle say of the probable lineup change
we 're look for ross to play ball as he do against dallas
no matter the circumstance the giants express confidence they could defeat the panther if they repeat the success they have last year against newton the first player take in the 2011 draft and one of the game 's most dynamic player
the giants hold newton to 16-of-30 pass for 242 yard and intercept him three time
although newton be difficult to tackle at 6 foot 5 inch and 245 pound the giants limit his effectiveness as a ball carrier by take a double digit lead
he rush six time for 6 yard include his team 's only touchdown
it come in the third quarter after the visitor have build a 23 0 lead
it be a rare poor afternoon for newton who become the only player in n.f.l. history to pass for more than 8,000 yard 8,045 and 40 touchdown 41 while run for more than 1,000 yard 1,045 and 20 touchdown 22 in his first 33 game
he pass for 3,869 yard and rush for 741 yard and 8 touchdown last year when he become the first quarterback to lead his team in rush since donovan mcnabb pace the philadelphia eagles in 2000
he be a special athlete mundy say
he can bring the ball down and get 5 yard or he can get 70 yard
although the giants have only two sack defensive end mathias kiwanuka say he think they could turn up the pressure against newton
everybody know about his foot and when he escape the pocket that he can still look down the field and he can make people miss kiwanuka say
so our job will be to push the pocket get people up in his face and make sure we get him down on the ground
extra points hakeem nicks be give an excused absence from practice so he could attend to personal matter
nicks be expect back for sunday 's game

coach tom coughlin continue to keep focus on the game rather than on the death of his young brother john who will be bury tuesday

newark when the devils acquire forward ilya kovalchuk in 2010 and later sign him to a 15-year contract he be expect to one day own the team 's offensive record
the devil and the owner jeff vanderbeek so want to build their franchise around kovalchuk that they accept severe penalty for initially offer him a 17-year $ 102 million deal
but just two year into his contract kovalchuk exit retire from the n.h.l. to play with ska st. petersburg in the kontinental hockey league and leave the devil forward line in a state of flux
weeks later vanderbeek sell the club to josh harris the owner of the philadelphia 76ers
in some way it be fitting that kovalchuk and vanderbeek depart mere week apart
vanderbeek a new jersey native be the showy owner who get newark 's shiny prudential center build but nearly sink the devil into bankruptcy in the process
kovalchuk be the limitless offensive threat who help the devil reach the 2012 stanley cup final then return to his homeland 13 month later
kovalchuk 's departure alone would leave a huge hole
he score 89 goal after arrive in february 2010 and he be second on the team in point last season 31 despite miss 11 game with a shoulder injury
he have significant ice time include on special team and his mere presence create offensive opening for teammate
you 're not go to go out in ufa and fill an ilya kovalchuk say devils forward ryane clowe refer to unrestricted free agency
there be only so many of those in the world
but couple kovalchuk 's departure with that of david clarkson and his 45 goal over the last two season and the devil be miss two of their top three scorer from a team that only score 112 goal and miss the playoff last year
clarkson a toronto native bolt for a seven year $ 36.75 million deal with the maple leafs
still the devils feel poised to surprise critic who say they will not be able to score enough goal this year
we have a good mix of veteran energy guy and skill guy say patrik elias the devils scoring leader from a year ago with 36 point at age 37
there be a lot of talented guy on this team
harris bring financial stability and general manager lou lamoriello go back to basic aim to replace clarkson and kovalchuk with tough physical forward
he re sign center adam henrique to a 6-year $ 24 million deal
henrique and the top line center travis zajac be sign through 2018 19
lamoriello also add jaromir jagr the n.h.l. 's active leader in goal and clowe and michael ryder free agent from newfoundland
ryder and clowe make their devils preseason debut in a 5 3 loss to the islanders on thursday and have share time in practice on the same line
devil coach pete deboer acknowledge it be too early to set lineup but the notion of them play on the same line would excite some fan in eastern canada
that have not really happen before two guy from newfoundland play on the same team and the same line say clowe who play for the rangers after the trade deadline last season
i 'm sure everyone back home would love to see it
the devil also sign the 27-year old forward damien brunner to a professional tryout monday
brunner be on the ice for three islanders goal thursday but he share time on the ice with the top forward zajac dainius zubrus and rostislav olesz
he play with elias in power play drill tuesday his first full day as a devil
it ' always nice to be part of a new group and bring some energy say brunner who have 26 point for the detroit red wings last season his first in the n.h.l. after star in his native switzerland
the devil be a first class organization you can tell just be here
i hope it all turn out well
the devil power play rank 21st last season score on 15.9 percent of its chance
the team expect brunner to help improve that
he be also talented in shootout another area the devils hope to fix
they be 2 7 in shootout last season
he can make some play when he have the puck on his stick deboer say
there ' a good chance something good be go to happen offensively
we could use a little bit of that
the devil may have new face but they be not young face
ryder and clowe be in their 30 and jagr will be 42 in february
injury have already bite the devils forward
on the first day of training camp last week jagr leave the ice after 10 minute with what the team have call lower body soreness
he have not practice since though deboer say friday that jagr be skating and would return soon
clowe sustain a low body injury against the islanders and do not practice friday
forward mattias tedenby 23 leave practice friday with a low body injury and do not return
the devils play the islanders again saturday night at barclays center in brooklyn for the first n.h.l. game at the arena which the islanders will call home start in 2015
still for someone like tedenby a former first round pick who have play just 105 n.h.l. game over three season team with a slew of veteran forward be enormously beneficial
that in turn may be productive for the devil offense down the line
i 'm really excited to be around them and play with them tedenby say
it ' good for young guy like me who want to get to their level

of course that vacuous middle ground be an uneasy backdrop for this final homestand straddle the belief that there will be postseason life and the reality that it may be now or never for goodbye

it would be rodriguez

it just be n't
and i think you gotta go to work
and i think people should be next to each other to the extent possible
to which i say where ' the evidence that physical proximity to one another help people work better or more creatively
and where ' the evidence that professional be any less productive when they work at home
it ' time for more employer to take advantage of modern technology and allow telecommuting
then people wo not have to choose between have a nice house in the suburb with a long commute and living in an overpriced condo near or in a city
they will live better spend more time with their child and be more productive when they do not have a costly stressful commute every day
and they can work just as closely with their colleague as they can when they 're in the same office

for 12 year people in our company work from home office
for the last year and a half most of us have be work out of an office in manhattan
this experience have convince me that people who work collaboratively work more creatively more efficiently and more productively when in close proximity
some of our employee still work from home and i have notice that they 're often about half a step out of sync with the rest of us because they 're simply not in the flow of day to day operation
yes you can get a great deal do by internet and conference call but not everything that transpire in a company be document in an e mail or a phone call
there ' all that in between stuff the stuff that happen between the idea and the delivery
moreover it ' difficult for an employer to ascertain the productivity of a worker who be not in the office
an employee work from home can run errand go to the gym or otherwise not do his or her work without the employer know it
a number of our remote employee have prove this to me over the year
and finally there ' the human factor
inflection mood and meaning be all much more apparent in person than over the phone and certainly more than in an e mail
when it ' really important people will inevitably say we should meet in person to discuss this
as far as i be concerned business be really important every day so we should meet in person every day to conduct it

the thing that make a congressman effective in the south be constituent service say sonny callahan who represent the district in congress from 1985 to 2003
such a candidate in the past may have be bradley byrne 58 a former state senator and the current front runner or perhaps chad a. fincher 39 a two term state legislator from mobile 's conservative western suburb
but with no heir apparent for the first time in 50 year the full spectrum of conservatism be on display from mr. byrne who speak sunnily of the country 's ability to overcome any of its current challenge to dean young a real estate developer and tea party favorite who describe the stake of the election in far less optimistic term
we be witness the end of a western christian empire mr. young 49 say at the forum
the republican field quickly populate after representative jo bonner announce in may that he be step down for a position with the university of alabama system the state democratic party miss the filing deadline though the two democratic candidate be allow to run anyway
in addition to mr. byrne mr. young and mr. fincher the field include wells griffith 31 a hometown boy make good who recently work at the republican national committee and whose supporter see him as a direct line to representative paul d. ryan and the other young prominent figure of the right and quin hillyer 49 a conservative journalist whose detailed policy analysis and list of endorsement testify to decade in the premier circle of the conservative movement
everyone expect a runoff and the runoff could include any of these
the only candidate assume to be a lock be mr. byrne the best finance and most widely know
mr. byrne whose political career and support from the business community have mark him as the establishment candidate be know statewide for a bruising race for governor in 2010
that republican primary become a pitched battle between mr. byrne who have the broad backing of republican leader and tim james a staunch conservative and son of a former governor
their fighting and a nasty scrap mr. byrne get into with the teacher union leave voter cold and open the way for another republican robert j. bentley a mild mannered dermatologist who now sit in the governor 's mansion
this recent lesson about the wisdom of let others do the attack perhaps explain how well mannered this primary have be so far
but negativity linger from the ad war in 2010 include perception that mr. byrne a democrat until 1997 be insufficiently conservative
he like the others support get rid of the president 's health care law and have even propose abolish the internal revenue service
but he talk repeatedly of spending on infrastructure and work with congressional democrats where possible
and cite a huge investment by the aircraft maker airbus that may transform mobile mr. byrne be surprisingly upbeat for a conservative running in these time
i think people be concerned he say in an interview at a campaign gathering for young professional many of them young man with good haircut and press khaki
but people do not want to be angry
they want to be hopeful
this may be an accurate read of the district
but in what be expect to be an election with very low turnout it remain to be see whether it be a good read of those at the poll
if not the beneficiary may be mr. young
mr. young who make a serious run at mr. bonner in 2012 and have finance much of his own campaign this year say he would vote against raise the debt ceiling see those who would compromise in congress as spineless and boast of support from chief justice roy moore of the alabama supreme court a hero among the hard right evangelicals who form mr. young 's base
supporter of the other candidate speak with a respectful and perhaps wary bewilderment about this base
its electoral behavior often elude pollster and competitor as chief justice moore 's recent career illustrate
famed for instal a ten commandment monument in the state judicial building in 2003 chief justice moore run for governor in 2010 and to the surprise of many receive less than a fifth of the vote in the primary
two year later he run for chief justice and to the surprise of many win the primary without a runoff
if we get a 10 percent turnout who know what be go to happen say lou campomenosi a political science professor at tulane university who be involve in alabama 's tea party movement
that ' why i think dean become the real wild card candidate because he ' get this really fervent group behind him
an hour northeast of mobile mr. fincher be greet voter at a fair in atmore
in a condensed campaign mr. fincher 's name recognition be a considerable advantage and many believe that he be likely to meet mr. byrne in a runoff
at the fair mr. fincher talk of concern about an out of control federal government and a loss of christian value a message that resonate with people sit nearby and pick at barbecued rib
but concern just may not be a strong enough word
i think barack obama be the bad thing that ' ever happen to this country say stoney daw 72 a former federal law enforcement officer and now a small town police chief
i do not know if we can survive three more year
columbus ohio if marian gaborik feel the pressure of carry a franchise 's hope he do not show it
as he embark on his first full season with the columbus blue jackets there be no question that gaborik be the linchpin of the team 's offense
come off the weak of his dozen season in the n.h.l. he have big expectation to meet
that ' why i be here gaborik a three time all star say of the weight of be the club 's no 1 offensive threat
at the same time i want to provide anything that it take to win game not just score
i want to be an all around player and help the team in any way
he have score at least 30 goal in a season seven time surpass 40 three time
last season slow by a tear abdominal muscle he have only 12 goal in 47 game
he be acquire from the rangers at the trade deadline for forward derick brassard and derek dorsett and defenseman john moore
gaborik play well down the stretch as the blue jackets go 19 5 5 and miss the playoff on a tiebreaker
people get catch up in a certain year 's statistic just look over the guy 's whole career blue jackets forward r. j. umberger say
i mean he score goal he ' do it since he start play hockey
sometimes guy go through ups and down
he know how to score and he will score a ton for us
the prevail opinion be that gaborik 31 have be too good for too long not to have a great season
he play that game where you may not notice him and then all of a sudden boom
he take off and it ' in the back of the net forward nick foligno say
that ' the kind of elite player that he be
he ' so dynamic and play the game at such a high level that even if you try to contain him he ' so hard to hold
the blue jackets be build on hard work and the brick wall in net provide by goaltender sergei bobrovsky last season 's vezina trophy winner
they have a cadre of double figure goal scorer in brandon dubinsky artem anisimov mark letestu umberger foligno and the off season free agent signing nathan horton
they be also count on a group of young wing cam atkinson ryan johansen and matt calvert to provide an uptick on offense
still gaborik be probably the only player on the roster who would get the attention of an oppose defense
and the blue jackets youngster seem awed by him
he ' an elite talent calvert say
the number of goal he ' put up in the league already be amazing
to have a guy like that to have that offensive ability when we do need that big goal in the last minute he get the puck on his tape after we find him and he ' go to put it in the back of the net
that ' always reassuring
gaborik almost begin his career in columbus
there be a coin flip before the 2000 draft to find out which of the two expansion franchise the blue jackets or the minnesota wild would pick no
3 and which would go next
the blue jackets with a history of bad trade bad team bad player and bad luck lose
gaborik go to the wild and the blue jackets take defenseman rostislav klesla a serviceable journeyman on the blue line now with phoenix
gaborik develop into one of the most fear sniper in the league
he have 336 goal and 338 assist in 769 game
when the rangers make him available at the trade deadline general manager jarmo kekalainen and the director of hockey operation john davidson jump at the chance
have a player like gaborik change us davidson say
always one of the fast skater in the league with one of the quick shot gaborik appear to be as quick as ever healthy and energize by his new surroundings
he know the offensive burden he carry
obviously scoring be go to be very important he say but you can not go out there think i have to score i have to score
you just have to focus on other part of the game as well
the goal will come when you work hard and do your job
coach todd richards say he have like what he have see of gaborik in training camp
i sense that he ' focus he ' ready to work richards say

and he ' ready to have a good season
this be the final year of gaborik 's contract
the blue jackets say they want to negotiate with him once the season begin
leave unsaid be that they want to see if gaborik an occasionally laconic player be motivate to have a big season
it ' a big year for us and for myself as well gaborik say
i 'm not think about contract right now
i will go out have fun enjoy myself play hard and thing will work out

when dr. john h. kennell be a hospital pediatrician in the 1950 newborn be typically whisk away within minute of delivery wash weigh blood test and plunk into bassinet under the nursery 's fluorescent light
their mother would not be permit to hold them for 12 hour sometimes longer
at university hospital in cleveland where dr. kennell be the staff neonatologist nurse bottle feed infant every four hour
mother could visit but not for very long
dr. kennell who die on aug. 27 at 91 like to say that it be the full throated complaint about this state of affair by his patient that lead him to undertake a research project in the 1960 that help change the world on which most newborn now open their eye
his finding publish in maternal infant bonding a 1976 book write with dr. marshall h. klaus a fellow professor of pediatric medicine at case western reserve university in cleveland be consider a prime catalyst for change in hospital procedure that give new mother more private time with their infant let father into the delivery room and allow young child to visit new sibling in the hospital
the book 's central claim be that infant and their mother be hormonally prim in the first hour after birth to form crucial bond but that under hospital rule then commonly observe that process be not allow to happen
baby be ready to eat right away after be bear but they do not get to their mother for 12 hour dr. kennell say
no one be pay attention to what the baby want
the doctor idea be well receive by developmental psychologist who ascribe to attachment theory which link the relation newborn have with their first caregiver to their ability to have healthy relationship in adulthood
relatively quickly bonding become widely adopt as part of maternity ward routine
but maternal infant bonding come under severe criticism
fellow researcher say its conclusion be base on too small a case sample and put too much stock in the mother child interaction in the first hour
adoptive parent complain that the theory leave them out of the picture
some feminist saw it as just another way to place child rear responsibility solely on woman and to blame the mother if a child grow up troubled
dr. kennell and dr. klaus acknowledge mistake in their finding and publish a revise version of their book in 1982 parent infant bonding
though it stick to the original premise the new edition be less specific about a bonding timetable
the book have be update several time since
in an introduction to the 1996 edition the noted pediatrician author dr. t. berry brazelton defend the author
despite criticism by some that proof of a sensitive period for bonding between parent and baby have not be show the author have continue to fight for a more humane atmosphere in hospital at the time of delivery dr. brazelton write include time for early attachment behavior between a new parent and baby
we now realize how important it be to create this atmosphere
the sea change in hospital childbirth practice draw on many social current of the 1960 and 70 include the natural childbirth movement the woman 's movement and an anti authoritarian climate say j. kevin nugent the director of the brazelton institute a child and family research center found by dr. brazelton at boston children 's hospital
maternal infant bonding he say strike a chord with a broad cross section of woman many of them nurse and hospital administrator who be also mother and be receptive to the change it propose
hospital procedure be gear to the efficient running of hospital rather than to the need of mother and baby dr. nugent add
john help change that
john hawks kennell be bear on jan. 9 1922 in reading pa. to doris hawks and carlyle kennell and grow up in buffalo
his mother be a high school english teacher and his father an insurance salesman
after medical school at the university of rochester and two year in the navy dr. kennell do his residency at harvard medical school
he be the chief resident at boston children 's hospital before he move to cleveland in 1952 to teach at case western reserve and serve as the attend pediatrician in the neonatal unit of the university hospital
dr. kennell who die in cleveland be survive by his wife margaret lloyd kennell a daughter susan two son david and john who confirm his death and five grandchild
dr. kennell go on to study the bonding process from another perspective look at parent of infant who die in delivery or soon after be bear
he be one of the first neonatal expert to recommend that the grieve parent hold their newborn and his insight about the emotional benefit such physical contact can provide parent have be incorporate in the standard procedure of most neonatal intensive care unit
dr. kennell also become an advocate of doula train nonmedical professional who help woman during pregnancy labor and postpartum
with phyllis h. klaus and dr. klaus he write the doula book how a train labor companion can help you have a short easy and healthier birth publish in 2003 and now in its third printing
the great question of his work however be the mystery of the chemistry between child and parent
what be the process by which a father and mother become attach to an infant he ask in bonding a 1996 book he also write with the klauses
we have develop ever great respect for the complexity of the process
it be our continue quest
michael cuddyer have never hit .300 in a major league season
a .271 career batter come into 2013 cuddyer an outfielder for the colorado rockies hit a career high .284 in 2006 with minnesota
the last time he hit high than .300 in a full season on any level be 2001 when as a 22-year old he hit .301 for class aa new britain
if you include his 4-for-18 performance in a brief call up to the major that season his average drop to .298
all of that make it curious that cuddyer at 34 and in his 13th season lead a tight race for the national league batting title with a .331 average enter saturday 's game
cuddyer be not the most surprising player in recent baseball history to lead the n.l. in hit
in 12 season and nearly 5,000 plate appearance he be well establish as a power hitter with a mod average but his ascension to the top of the batting leader be no more shocking than that of derrek lee a chicago cubs first baseman who lead the n.l. with a .335 average in 2005 after hit .266 in his first eight season
what make a potential batting title for cuddyer interesting be that he be play for the rockies
once know for home run help by denver 's thin air and know as the blake street bombers the rockies have actually be far more dominant in term of batting title and that be something that no humidor have be able to change
andres galarraga the first player to sign with the rockies get thing start right by post an n.l.-lead .370 average in 1993 the franchise 's inaugural season
he hit .243 for st. louis the season before
include galarraga a colorado batter have hit .330 or high 16 time lead to seven batting title
the rockies lead the major in those category since their inception
the yankees come close with a player bat .330 or better 11 time no other team be in double digit
in term of batter who could be accuse of take advantage of coors field cuddyer fit between jeffrey hammonds who have a home/road split of .399/.275 in 2000 and larry walker todd helton and matt holliday all of whom be excellent hitter in any park
help along by a .378 batting average on ball in play cuddyer be hit .347 at coors field enter the weekend and .318 on the road
the difference be not surprising because coors field have be the most conducive park in the major for hit in 2013 accord to espn 's park factor rating just as it be in each of the last five season
for all the talk of humidors and revamp pitch staff make colorado no longer a hitter 's haven no major league park be better for raise batting average
cuddyer have also benefit from a relatively weak field
he have a small lead over atlanta 's chris johnson another surprising name among the leader but his .331 average would have lead the league in only 15 of the previous 137 season
a stumble through july and august when cuddyer hit .287 in 167 at bat nearly sink his chance but he recover in september hit .404 in his first 15 game
if the race come down to the wire cuddyer will have to take care of business on the road as the rockies finish the season with a three game series in los angeles
a cuddyer batting title would come with many caveat but statistical outlier be part of what make examine baseball 's record book fun
with a strong final week cuddyer could join tony gwynn rogers hornsby and honus wagner on the list of n.l. batting champion and that be worth pay attention to
it be 2005 and brandon myers then a little use second year tight end at iowa go home for a weekend in the off season
home be prairie city iowa population 1,680 a hamlet with a grocery a convenience store a hardware center and no traffic light
myers drive five mile out of town down a dirt road next to cornfield and stop at the house where he grow up with his parent an old sister and an ever change assortment of hog horse and sheep
i know brandon be come to tell me that he be not go back to college his father dan myers say thursday
he be have a hard time
he think he be fail because he be not play and the coach be on him
they want him to change a lot of thing
father and son say little throughout the weekend visit dan 's construction work site and the 200-acre family farm where brandon learn to drive a combine as a child
then on sunday afternoon when myers be about to announce that he be not go back to college his father speak first
i tell him that year from now he do not want to be that guy stand in a bar in a small iowa town tell everyone how he could have be a big time football player dan myers say
i say that his college coach be test him to see if he would quit or if he would fight back
it be a pretty emotional deal a turning point moment
sit alongside the giants practice field myers who be tie for the team lead in reception this season also recall the 2005 conversation
my dad tell me not to give up on the chance to be something special he say thursday

he say i be too young for that
what he do be talk me out of a mistake
myers return to campus and the football team 's intense off season workout
there be a change in brandon say chris doyle iowa 's strength and conditioning coach
he have be a kid from a small town in iowa try to figure out thing on a high more complicated level
but when he commit himself fully we all saw the big time player we always think he could be
by his senior year myers be a first team all big ten selection and then a sixth round draft choice of the oakland raiders in 2009
that ' what parent be for right myers say with a smile
they help their kid when they need it most
after a breakout season with the struggle raiders in 2012 myers sign a one year free agent contract hop he could become the late in a long succession of less known giants tight end who have big role in the offense see jake ballard and kevin boss
with the giants talented wide receiver hakeem nicks and victor cruz work the sideline route a tight end have plenty of room in the middle of the field to find open space
that be exactly where myers be in the second quarter sunday during the giants game against the denver broncos
eli manning toss a pas to myers who catch the ball near the denver 30 with no defender between him and the end zone
myers turn and begin to sprint
about the 20 he trip without be touch and topple to the turf
it be a jarring gaffe
a 45-yard touchdown have become a 27-yard gain a good outcome but not the one the giants who trail by 4 point need
if giants fan have not yet learn the new tight end 's name they know by the end of that hard to watch play
i 've never ever do anything like that in a game myers 28 say
inexcusable
to make matter bad on the next play as myers be run another pattern across the middle with his head turn toward manning denver safety duke ihenacho who have be beat on the previous play slam his shoulder pad into myers 's rib cage
the violent hit draw a penalty
myers get up slowly
three play later as myers stand at the 1 a high pas from manning zip through his raise hand
as the ball be elude his grasp he be drill in the rib again
myers lay on the field for several second before he wobble to his foot and all but stagger to the edge of the giants field goal formation
he be still waver in his stance as josh brown kick a field goal
myers who have six catch for 74 yard in the game have his rib wrap the next day
ask about the sequence of play and his injury myers shrug and say it ' a contact sport
it would have be a lot better if i have not fall down

the 37-acre site be perhaps the most religiously contest place on earth
jews revere it as the home of the first and second temples 2,000 year ago
for muslims who call the site the noble sanctuary it be the world 's third holy spot from which muhammad be believe to have ascend to heaven
more than 300,000 foreign tourist also flock there annually many of them christians draw to the ruin of the temple jesus attend
politically the compete claim to the area be the nut around which the israeli palestinian conflict revolve the symbolic heart of each side 's religious and historical attachment to jerusalem that have make its governance one of the thorny issue in peace negotiation
israel capture the site along with the rest of east jerusalem and the west bank in 1967 with a general declare dramatically the temple mount be in our hand
but the government immediately return control to the muslim authorities and ever since a de facto accommodation have prevail in which muslims worship at al aksa above and jews at the western wall below a remnant of the retain wall around the ancient second temple

florham park n.j. against the back wall of the jets equipment room hang a green no
82 jersey
it rest on a green hanger and dangle from a silver hook and it do not belong to mickey shuler or rob carpenter who wear that number with pride or for that matter to anyone on the current roster
this can be the source of much confusion
a year ago when konrad reuland join the jets he wonder why a no 45 jersey be drape in the same spot
three week pass before he ask
i think maybe something happen reuland say
do someone pass away
be they honor somebody
be it a memorial
then i find out and i say oh that make sense
the answer to reuland 's question can be find on a small plaque affix to the wall above the jersey
it celebrate the recipient of the bill hampton award present to the rookie who best exemplify a pro in the locker room"- like josh baker no 45 and hayden smith no 82 who to reuland 's relief remain very much alive
the winner 's jersey hang for a year and in plain view of player mill about their locker
but the award name after hampton a beloved former equipment director who retire after the 2000 season have retain an air of mystery
the five member of the equipment staff who determine the winner by secret ballot do not mention it to rookie unless they be ask
so far only one defensive lineman sheldon richardson have
you get reward for act like a professional say richardson recall his reaction
should n't you just do that
in the eye of the equipment director gus granneman and his staff yes
ideally every rookie should comport himself like brad smith no
16 2006 who after practice would pick up his teammate discard sport drink bottle and deposit them in the trash
and ideally every rookie would have the awareness to pack the shoe best suit to that week 's playing surface instead of rely on granneman or his assistant to do it for him
but that be not what happen
as soon as rookie minicamp begin in may the staff start observe the contender
they notice if someone arrive in a suit or bookends his request with please and thank you
they also notice if a player turn his helmet into a storage receptacle or treat his locker like a junkyard
it be not immediately know how they feel about those player shoot wad up ball of athletic tape into trash can from across the room on friday
midway through the season the staff decide on the finalist
voting take place in mid december which be also when the politicking tend to begin
with a laugh granneman say that damon harrison last year 's runner up would call attention to his bag pack prowess
for much of the year though the player be not even aware that they be compete against one another
like many of his fellow rookie ryan spadola an undrafted receiver from lehigh have not even notice smith 's jersey hang in the equipment room let alone know the significance behind it
when tell spadola say it help him appreciate the high standard to which he say he hold himself as an n.f.l. player
everything be our responsibility at lehigh so you really have to take it upon yourself to hold yourself accountable spadola say
that ' how we be teach
for myself come here this be a great honor to have these guy help us out but i still need to take care of my area like it ' my little home or bedroom
cleanliness be only one of the criterion that granneman say he consider
attention to detail be important
so be politeness
a few rookie who be otherwise unaware of the hampton award offer their interpretation of what the equipment staff value
be accountable to your teammate richardson say
treat people and your equipment with dignity and respect offensive tackle oday aboushi say
a high maturity level because we all just come from college guard will campbell say
other equipment staff around the league no doubt expect their player to act professionally but the jets appear to be the only one that honor them for it
of the 26 team that respond to an inquiry only one bestow a similar award the philadelphia eagles under andy reid honor the player not the rookie who exemplify professionalism
an eagles spokesman say in an e mail that he do not know whether the new coach chip kelly would continue the practice
when the jets relocate here from hempstead n.y. in 2008 granneman say that one of his first thought be where to put the jersey
the tradition informally date to 2002 when the equipment staff decide to reward a player who have show mark improvement over the course of the season
as a joke they give him a sweatshirt
but it occur to granneman to introduce a more formal award and he do so in 2004
erik coleman no 26
the nine previous winner range from the sublime darrelle revis 2007 to the shifty danny woodhead 2008 to the sturdy matt slauson 2009 with the victory by slauson a guard buck precedent and conventional wisdom
if a lineman win it you know he ' really go good granneman say
those guy by nature be not the neat
not many seem to have much stay power
it be the jets micro version of the madden video game curse or the sports illustrated cover jinx because the last three recipient john conner baker and smith be all out of the n.f.l. we have not have good luck predict long term success with the jets granneman say
naturally that will not stop him from grant the award for a 10th consecutive season
granneman decline to handicap an early favorite but say there be plenty of appealing candidate
we 've be watch he say
in the spring of the 1995 major league baseball season a rookie name andy pettitte be pitch in relief for the yankees

rivera he note be hit so hard by the a 's that he resemble their favorite batting practice pitcher

the day after rivera be knock out of that game leave the yankees with a 14 21 record it be the 22-year old pettitte 's turn
he have make his major league debut nearly a month before rivera have in a brief relief stint april 29 against kansas city and have make four more appearance out of the bullpen before manager buck showalter put him in the starting rotation
he last five and a third inning against the a 's in oakland in his first start on may 27 a 3 0 loss
he pitch a complete game against the angels at yankee stadium on june 2 but lose again this time by 3 2
and now start no
3 against the same a 's team that have hammer rivera the day before
pettitte go seven inning allow just one run and four hit and earn his first major league victory as the yankees prevail 6 1
for one night pettitte be a savior of sort curry write in the times
he save the yankees from disappear even deeper in the american league east standing save them from possibly be sweep by oakland and save them from another night of discontent by pitch wondrously

the rest be
well you know the rest
pettitte who go 12 9 that first season now have 255 victory the most of any active pitcher
rivera who end up make 10 start in 1995 and none after that have more save than any other pitcher 652
and over the last two decade he have close out 72 of pettitte 's victory
but for two day in june 1995 it be the other way around with pettitte pick up for rivera

team hop to bolster their pitching rotation this winter will have a final look at most of their free agent option this week and all be hop for the kind of success the los angeles dodgers and the pittsburgh pirates have last off season
ervin santana matt garza tim lincecum and ricky nolasco be among the player available but base on last winter 's signing there be really only two choice for lure a productive free agent starter from another team pay exorbitant price for a premium talent or pay almost nothing and hope for a turnaround
most other deal at least last off season disappointed edwin jackson and joe blanton dan haren and brandon mccarthy joe saunders and shaun marcum to name a few
at the top of the salary scale the dodgers lavish six year and $ 147 million on zack greinke who be 15 3 with a 2.75 earn run average for the national league west champion
at the bottom the pirates pull off the steal of the off season snag francisco liriano for a guarantee of just $ 1 million
liriano lead the pirates in win go 16 7 with an e.r.a. of 2.88 and the team be poise for its first win season since 1992 and almost certainly a berth in the playoff
even after be name to the all star team in july jeff locke a fellow pirates leave hander call liriano the most important part of the team 's renaissance
liriano be that miss piece that kind of put everything together locke say
frankie 's fun to watch
liriano 29 have be fun to watch before
he win 12 of 15 decision as a rookie for minnesota in 2006 and throw a no hitter for the twins in 2011
but he slip badly in 2012 go 6 12 with a 5.34 e.r.a. for the twins and the chicago white sox
the pirates who raise their payroll this season but still hunt for bargain take an interest
i do not know that we saw something that everybody else miss general manager neal huntington say
we be willing to take a chance
we saw a guy that if everything click have three above average major league pitch the slider and the changeup for sure and the fastball if we could get him to command it a little bit better
with the change in league with the change in ballpark with the change in team we think he could come over here and do a very nice job for us
the previous off season the pirates have take a similar chance on a. j. burnett acquire him in a trade with the yankees
like liriano burnett have exceptional stuff but often struggle to harness it
in a new environment burnett flourish go 16 10 in 2012
he have tail off to 8 11 in 2013
the pirates and liriano originally agree to a two year $ 12.75 million contract last off season
but before he sign the deal liriano break his right nonthrowing arm in an accident at home
that slash the guarantee to just $ 1 million
it essentially make it a make good deal huntington say that if he get healthy and stay healthy he have a chance to earn the money that he would have make
and he ' go out and he ' earn it
i can not say enough good thing about the man
despite miss the first month of the season liriano reach a career high in victory with 15 on aug. 30
after that game he say he have change his approach since his young day
i 'm not try to be a strikeout guy say liriano who still average roughly a strikeout an inning

early in my career i be go to try harder and blow people out
now i just try to go deep in game
reduce his walk have probably help the most
in each of the last two season liriano average at least five walk per nine inning
this season help by a delivery in which he get his hand high over his head liriano have average about three and a half walk per nine
he ' become fearless with pound the strike zone huntington say
he still get a lot of chase but he ' throw better quality strike than he have in the past
it be a choice of risk reward for us and we decide to go with the high risk/high reward guy because we feel like if we hit we have a chance to really grab a very good major league pitcher and he deserve the credit

london acquiesce to year of afghan government demand pakistan release a senior taliban commander on saturday in a bid to help kick start peace talk in afghanistan
but news of the release meet with a mixed reception in afghanistan amid question about the extent of the free commander 's influence over the taliban or his personal intent toward peace talk
the pakistani foreign ministry say it have release the commander mullah abdul ghani baradar a found member of the afghan taliban and a former deputy to the movement 's leader mullah muhammad omar in an effort to further facilitate the afghan reconciliation process
mr. baradar be capture in a joint operation by the c.i.a. and pakistani intelligence in the port city of karachi in 2010 and his detention have be a point of contention among pakistan afghanistan and the united states ever since
wakil ahmad muttawakil a former taliban foreign minister welcome mr. baradar 's release as a step toward peace talk between the afghan government and insurgent
but a taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid decline to comment say he be wait for direction from his superior
i can not say anything until i receive something from our superior he say
i have be try to get reaction all day
the release have be expect for several week
critic of such release who be most vocal in afghanistan point out that mr. baradar have not publicly state whether he support peace negotiation or whether be willing to play a role in talk
we have to be cautious and we should not be overly optimistic about what be go to happen next say sayed mohammad amin tariq a member of afghanistan 's high peace council from badakhshan
we should now see if mr. baradar can really help the peace process or whether he will rejoin the taliban and fight
a spokesman for the high peace council maulavi shahzada shahid be more upbeat however call the release a good sign for the strengthening of the peace process between the taliban and the afghan government
now it be mullah baradar 's moral obligation for the sake of peace and stability he should assist the peace process between the taliban and the afghan government mr. shahid add

berlin it would be easy to mock the political campaign that end with sunday 's national election in germany as a version of fiddle while rome burn
it have lack any heated debate over the nation 's role in maintain the common european currency or address the crippling level of unemployment among its southern neighbor
the clash over intervention in syria that consume the britain france russia and the united states for week barely make a political ripple here underscore how deeply germans shun the use of force
chancellor angela merkel 's center right government and the left lean opposition remain largely united in support an ambitious and costly plan to wean the economy off nuclear power and carbon fuel
there be little talk of the demographic challenge of an age population
it be a showcase for the postwar german tendency toward consensus and be all the more remarkable for the contrast it provide to the bitter ideological clash play out in the united states and many other big democracy
it could well yield an outcome almost unfathomable in peacetime washington paris or london a power sharing agreement between the main party of the left and right
the relative comity between the major party on the campaign trail do not mean that ms. merkel assume she emerge to lead the next government can escape tough choice or that germany can insulate itself from force beyond its control from the financial market and the global economy to tumult in the middle east and a russia that be try to reassert itself
welcome by many germans as stability at a time of prosperity the mood may nonetheless disappoint germany 's allies in the united states who would love to see the country assert itself more in europe as well as its partner in the european union who just want to end the bloc 's doldrums and look to germany for bold action
frustrating as it may be this germany of slow step and consensus politics be precisely the one that the united states and its victorious european allies seek to forge in the smoldering ruin of world war ii.
it be a structure that be reinforce as late as the country 's reunification after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 when the old german question of how to tame the country 's undoubted power be solve by wrap it still tight in the bond of a unify europe the very one be test today by a slow grind economic crisis
it be also a system that have promote steady and farsighted vision on big issue
more than in most western democracy german leader include ms. merkel who be seek a third term have persuade their people to endure short term pain for long term gain whether reunification energy transformation or a decade ago the kind of labor and economic overhaul that other european nation be still blink at
we be the student very eager to learn the american re education program say jã¼rgen falter 69 a professor at the university of mainz and an expert both on the nazi past and germany 's complex electoral system
and we have really fully internalize it we go for pacifism not belligerence consensus rather than conflict
after 1945 the allies deliberately build a federal structure that disperse power from berlin and scatter national institution throughout what be then west germany
in addition they devise an electoral law virtually guarantee to produce a coalition government no chancellor since konrad adenauer in the late 1950 have be able to govern alone
for proof take ms. merkel of the christian democrats and her main rival peer steinbrã¼ck of the social democrats
numerous domestic and international observer have struggle to detect vibrancy in the back and forth between ms. merkel 's camp and mr. steinbrã¼ck 's over any range of issue child allowance for nonworking mother how best to preserve generally good and cheap health care and even what berlin really intend for the 17-nation euro zone or the 28-member european union
the distinction in their position fall squarely into the two social grouping from which they spring the christian middle class in the case of the christian democrats and the working class and trade union for the social democrats
the center left be more open about the possible need to raise tax give the impoverished state of germany 's municipal and state coffer
by common agreement the national infrastructure road rail bridge and the broadband internet sorely need attention and investment 1 2 next page

the lesson for me be that a very important part of leadership be to set a bar for people and to constantly keep them out of their comfort zone
i think status quo be a real enemy for progress
and get out of my own comfort zone be just as important
q. any other influence from your parent
a.
i ask my mom recently if she saw anything in my early childhood year that would tell her that there be something great in store for me
she tell a story of when i be pretty young and i have some medical problem
she take me to an ayurvedic doctor and he give me a concoction that i have to put on my tongue rather than swallow every day
i would do it every day and not complain
one day my mom try the medicine to see what it taste like
and she say it be the most bitter awful medicine
when she be tell me about this recently she say i think one of the thing about you be that you do not complain about something you have to do
and i think this be a leadership lesson too
you have to swallow many bitter pill in your life
you just can not keep complain about how life should be
you have get to accept the way you have to run your life and then do the very best you can
q. tell me about your first career job
a. i come from a background of entrepreneur and after i get my m.b.a. i join a start up rather than a big company
i find that to be a much more exciting way of learning
i become an area sale manager for an electric typewriter company and i be send to a state call gujarat
we go there and there be nothing
i say to my bos can you even tell me where ' the office
which way do you want me to go
he say there ' no office address
that ' why we hire you to build our business
and for the next couple of year i recruit a huge number of people and we create the second large business of that company
so i tell people that when you choose your first job choose one where you can really make a difference from day 1 rather than get submerge in a big company mind set
it also teach me that if you be go to be successful you have get to treat your company like your very own
because as an entrepreneur you be depend on yourself to create the value not anyone else
you can not rely on other people to tell you what to do
you have get to take the initiative yourself
and if you do that you know you be go to have a great chance of success
q. important lesson you have learn from mentor over the year
a. my previous bos be a very successful c.e.o. he run the company for over a decade and we achieve fantastic result
he teach me many thing but he be immensely focused
time be the only one clear constraint in life and if you focus on a few thing you have a great chance of achieve something interesting
he teach people like me and others who have this burn desire to achieve more and more to prioritize and to be very consistent with the priority
he never change the strategy in 12 year
he focus on a few big thing and go after them
q.
you say you come from a family of entrepreneur but now you 're run a big company
how do you try to foster an entrepreneurial culture
a. you have to take risk
entrepreneurship also mean that we need more idea than we have money for
i keep tell people you think we be work for a big company but i be go to starve you of resource
only then will i have the best idea
scarcity give rise to more idea than abundance do
scarcity be the mother of invention
i have grow up like that
scale be also the enemy of speed
as you become big you 're go to get slow and slow
so you have to create small team because they be more effective and more efficient than big team
you also have to be careful about how many layer you 're create
q.
how do you hire
what quality be you look for
a. one be how bright they be
you have get to have a level of intellectual agility
the second thing i look for be hunger for success
be the person hungry or have they have enough
if there ' hunger for success the person will by and large outperform those who do n't
q.
and your career advice
a.
in my whole life i have never worry about my next job
i never do
i never think since i be do so well what will come next
i always think the job i be do be the very best job of my life
so i tell people do not worry about what somebody else be do and when they be get promote and how much money they 're make
we look around a bit too much
none of that be go to help you do a better job
so do the very best you can of the job that be give to you
it ' like swallow the bitter pill
stop complain
i hate complain
put heart and emotion into it
that ' it
adonis lebanon when russia 's foreign minister sergey v. lavrov want to bolster his argument that rebel have carry out the poison ga attack near damascus on aug. 21 he point to the work of a 61-year old lebanese bear nun who have conclude that the horrifying video show hundred of dead and choke victim include many child have be fabricate ahead of time to provide a pretext for foreign intervention
mr. lavrov be an intelligent person say the nun mother agnes mariam of the cross with a wide smile in a recent interview in this lebanese mountain town
he will never stick his name to someone who be say stupidity
mother agnes who have live in syria for year have no expertise or training in chemical weapon forensics or filmmaking and although she be in damascus at the time of the attack she do not visit the site or interview victim
still her assertion she do not say which side make the video have significantly raise her once mod profile as the longtime superior of the monastery of st. james the mutilated a melkite greek catholic monastery in central syria
now she be laud by supporter of syria 's president bashar al assad for champion narrative that resemble his own and vilify by opposition activist who suspect the government support her work as an unofficial ambassador
international right group see mr. lavrov 's reference to the work of an untrained nun as a sign of desperation
the fact that the russian government be rely on this woman 's assessment of what happen just show the lack of evidence for their case say lama fakih a syria researcher for human rights watch

she be not a military expert
there be other shadow around mother agnes
she have help foreign journalist obtain visa suggest trust by the government
the widow and two colleague of gilles jacquier a french journalist kill in homs last year publish a book in which they suggest that she conspire in a lethal trap set by the government
she have sue them for libel deny any link to the government and have not speak out in support of mr. assad himself
she criticize syria for its occupation of lebanon that end in 2005 and say that government helicopter have strike near the st. james monastery three time cause damage
her only interest she say be what be best for syrians she say that would be for outside power not to interfere so that syrians could solve their problem
it be not politics she say
this be humanitarian
she refuse to say who she think have make the video she call fake or who she think have carry out the attack
i can not incriminate and i wo not incriminate she say
but she suspect that some of the child in the video have be abduct by fighter from al qaeda in alawite village more than 150 mile away a view also voice by syrian official
in a baggy brown habit a white wimple a black veil and rubber sandal with a large cross around her neck mother agnes describe a devout life that until recently have stay away from middle east politics
bear marie fadia laham in beirut she be educate by french nun
the death of her father when she be 15 leave her ask existential question
this lead me to become a hippie she say with a grin
she fall in with foreigner who come to lebanon for the drug lebanese marijuana be the best in the world she say and travel to india and tibet before return to religion
at 19 she say she become a nun in the carmelite order where she spend the next 22 year
much of that be consume by lebanon 's 15-year civil war during which she aid displace family she say
she eventually move to syria become the superior at the st. james monastery and oversee a community of 3 monk and 12 nun in the town of qara in the homs diocese
the uprising that begin in syria in 2011 trickle into the monastery at first through story tell by muslim laborer mother agnes say
but she become more immerse later that year when she begin her own research
through conversation with syrians and clergy throughout the country she say she uncover the false flag of the arab spring
instead of a popular uprising by citizen enrage by economic stagnation and political oppression she say she find a conspiracy cook up by international power to destroy syria
she say the government 's brutal crackdown on peaceful protester have be concoct by the news medium and she dismiss the slow transformation of the opposition movement into an armed uprising say the rebel have rush to violence
while allow that some protester have good intention she say the conflict be drive by foreign power include israel saudi arabia the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda
she point to syria 's current situation with more than 100,000 dead bitter sectarian tension and jihadist take over swath of territory as proof that she be right all along
what happen be the interference of half the globe in syrian affair infiltrate syria with foreign fighter recycle al qaeda and put under threat the civilian population she say add that the world have fail syria
we be here and we do not achieve anything
we destroy syria
she have pay a price for speak out
this year rebel near the monastery warn her that extremist fighter want to abduct her and help her flee she say
she have not return
after the chemical attack last month she say she lock herself in a hotel room in geneva and pore over video of the dead on her computer sleep only in short spurt and subsist on water
it be like a descent into hell she recall
she say she have submit her finding to foreign diplomat and official with the united nations human rights council in a 50-page report that point out what she consider inconsistency in the video and ask why there be few image of woman and burial
mr. lavrov cite her a few day later
her work have also win her acclaim with mr. assad 's supporter
many of them be in syria 's christian minority which make up 10 percent of the population and have mostly stay out of the war
many fear that a victory by the predominately sunni opposition would leave them with no place in the country and have cast their lot with mr. assad
she be a patriot she love syria and christianity she stand tall and be never afraid to tell the truth say a 30-year old christian woman reach by phone in damascus who give only her first name alissar for security reason
but sid ahmed hammouche a swiss reporter who help write the book accuse mother agnes of complicity in his colleague 's death see her differently

she defend the regime and play the christian card he say
we know very well that bashar want to play the christian card and he still do
