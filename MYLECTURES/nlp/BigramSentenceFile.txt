it take a moment for me to realize_that he be call from distilled to confirm my dinner reservation
yes i reply
cool he say and sound as if he mean it
distilled open in_june on the corner of franklin street and west broadway in tribeca the former home of drew nieporent 's layla and centrico
the belly dancer and the frozen margarita machine be go but a certain effervescence remain
so do mr. nieporent hover in the background as guru to distilled 's owner the first_time restaurateur nick iovacchini and shane lyons the 25-year old chef
the space be blandly handsome with dark wood and charcoal banquette breathlessly high ceiling and quasi medieval wheel chandelier like crown of fire
one side be devote to the bar where the drink by benjamin wood be lady killer elegant with a knife twist
occasionally 1980s mope rock shimmer from the speaker
service be confoundingly friendly almost coddle
when i stand outside read the post menu someone come hurry down the step to hand me my_own copy so i would not crane my neck he say
on arrival and departure a host leapt to open the door
the mission statement that precede one meal we be a modern american public house the waiter intone be both unnecessary and slightly coy about mr. lyons 's ambition
yes wing be on the menu but they be jack up with gochujang korean ferment soybean and chile paste borrow perhaps from the larder at momofuku noodle bar where mr. lyons work for a year
there be occasional technical flourish like watermelon cube cryovaced to intensify their flavor and mushroom surround_by puff of buttery onion soubise aerate by an isi siphon
a tousle of dehydrate and shave bacon adorn an open face sandwich of heirloom tomato and basil on sourdough a b.l.t. of course
sunflower sprout make up for the missing crunch
other classic be updated rather_than upend popcorn dust with garlic cumin and brewer 's yeast which evoke cheese snappy pickle ferment with gochugaru korean red chile powder pork rib glaze with more gochujang tease the sweet salty border without stray too far in either direction
onion ring batter with yuengling beer and tapioca flour be fry then frozen a theatrical waiter boast that they have be bring to negative 60 degree and fry again
they arrive nicely sturdy the sole purpose of their existence to ferry the narcotic like condiment burn scallion cut with jalapeã±os and mayonnaise with the sting of preserve lime
the substantial burger which the menu modestly refrain_from tell you be make with grass feed organic grain finish beef be abet by what may be the fine version_of tater tots in town the grate potato cook until just underdone and then crisp with wondra flour
everything here go to 11 one diner marvel
duck breaded and fried like chicken be brazen and irresistible despite the oversweet accompany waffle a spongy slab of brioche dredge in custard like french toast
even broccoli turn wanton fling with sliver of duck bacon and pickled watermelon rind in a fish sauce vinaigrette with wait for it a dollop of duck fat
but liver pã¢te serve with plume of bake dehydrate chicken skin
now this be confrontational
my mission in life be to make skinny girl fat mr. lyons tell my table
he get a laugh but the crackling be abandon after one bite
the only logical end to such a meal be s'mores deconstruct as be the fashion with a hickory smoke graham flour cake a torch smear of marshmallow fluff dark chocolate pudding and graham cracker break on top
it be obvious and no less pleasurable for it

recently i attend two extraordinary dinner in new_york one feature the precise focused red burgundy of rene engel and the other the exquisite cã´te rã´tie of marius gentaz
at their best these be the sort_of wine that amplify the sense of wonder at the heart of greatness
they be reminder that no_matter how rationally we try_to analyze wine they show their true measure in the emotion they evoke
engel and gentaz be great example of wine that express all the distinctive beauty of their terroirs enhance by the personal touch of the winemaker
these two small family estate share another important characteristic they no_longer exist
few passage in family business be more_difficult to negotiate than the leadership transition_from one generation to the next
ideally it occur seamlessly the parent cede control to the child while remain available to offer occasional advice and encouragement
but it may happen abruptly after sudden illness or death
it may be fierce as when oedipal drama interfere with judgment
or as in the case of engel and gentaz an estate hit a dead end with no heir to carry on
it_' in the nature of thing that estate come and go
most die off unmourned
their wine be not distinctive enough perhaps to be irreplaceable
yet for every great estate like jean louis chave of the northern rhã´ne say to have make wine continuously since 1481 the annals be replete with name now consign to history their wine to be savor wistfully or sell at auction for outlandish price bear of increase scarcity
henri jayer the legendary burgundian vigneron die in_2006 after retire some year before
his vineyard be now farm by his nephew by marriage emmanuel rouget whose wine be well respected but not revered
raymond trollat be for year the conscience of st.-joseph have adhere to traditional backbreaking agricultural method as others be take easy path
he retire in 2005 with no heir
i read recently that a bottle of his st.-joseph have sell at auction for $ 600 a ridiculous price for what be essentially a rustic but soulful village wine though perhaps not so ridiculous for the spirit of raymond trollat which be irreplaceable
noã«l verset play a similar role in cornas maintain the ancient tradition of this northern rhã´ne village through many lean year until the rest of the world learn to appreciate the wine
mr. verset retire and sell off his vine his wine surface occasionally like eloquent voice from the past
once a friend open a bottle of 1979 barbaresco from giovannini moresco a long go producer
what a beautiful legacy pure pale and elemental
it come and go so fast and sadly i have never see another bottle
alberico boncompagni ludovisi the prince of venosa produce his last wonderful bottle of fiorano from his estate within the city limit of rome in 1995
that year for reason he do_not explain he tear out his vineyard
the prince die in 2005 and after year of legal wrangling the estate be divide among his heir who replant the vineyard
one day we will see whether the new wine bear any relation to the old
continuity be easy in some region
in bordeaux for_example where so_many chateau be in the hand of corporation it_' more a matter of replace employee and carry on
but bordeaux be not always so corporate
jean franã§ois fillastre the proprietor of domaine du jaugaret one of my_favorite small bordeaux estate be 70 and have no heir
i wonder_what will happen to it
if life be fair rene engel would still be in the hand of the engel family
philippe engel take_over the estate in 1981 from his_father pierre who die young and by all account philippe transform a good producer into a terrific one
but he too die young of a heart attack at 49 in 2005
with no heir it be sell to franã§ois pinault the billionaire who also own chã¢teau latour and be now call domaine d'eugenie and be still discover its personality
at the small engel dinner at dbgb on the bowery we drink six bottle of grand cru burgundy clos vougeots from 1999 96 91 and 90 and grands ãchezeauxs from 99 and 98
as a group the wine be elegant subtle and complex yet with a touch of rusticity that seem to give them individuality
the 98 grand ãchezeaux especially stand_out
it be beautifully calibrate and clear spicy floral and burst with energy
the 99 grand ãchezeaux likewise show great finesse while the clos vougeots be rich and plumper lovely but maybe not with the same sense of intricate detail
we toast the memory of philippe engel and those_who have know him tell story of this adventurous man_who enjoy boating party and travel the world
by_contrast marius gentaz never go far from his home in ampuis
in many way his life have more in common with the 19th_century than the 21st
he farm less_than three acre on the dizzyingly steep slope of cã´te rã´tie and essentially make his wine label gentaz dervieux by hand
he begin in wine in 1947 with his_father in law then work on his_own from 1952 until 1993
when he retire his vine go to his nephew rene rostaing who blend them into his excellent cã´te rã´tie
but they be not gentaz dervieux
at the dinner put on at bar boulud by the rare wine company an importer several dozen of us drink 14 vintage from 1993 back to 1978
to drink any one of these bottle could have be the zenith of a wonderful meal to have 14 be overwhelming
and each seem to have a story to tell about a place and a man and a time when life be live locally
collectively these be gentle wine yet with a tensile strength that belie their graceful structure
they be savory and meaty typical of syrahs from the northern rhã´ne yet complex gorgeously fragrant mellow yet insistent
if i be press to reveal my_favorite i would say that i_love the soft 93 the ripe 90 and the ethereal 83
but the 88 be almost otherworldly in its beauty while the 87 be surprisingly open full and harmonious and the 85 still deep and dense with a mosaic of aroma and flavor that have many year to go to express themselves fully
it_' bittersweet to drink wine like these know that each open bottle be one less to go around
yet it_' also a time to celebrate that part_of the human spirit that allow us to see beyond ourselves know that memory travel further than flesh
shin star doctor_sleep stephen_king 's much-â­anticipated sequel to the shining be not on the hardcover list yet its official release date be sept._24 but back in 1977 the shining do spend time there on its way to become a cultural touchstone
it also sell well in paperback especially after stanley kubrick 's 1980 film adaptation
the shining be king 's third novel and both the book_review and the daily new_york times pay_attention though king may have wish they have n't to say that stephen_king be not an elegant writer jack sullivan grouse in the book_review be put it mildly
the daily 's reviewer richard r. lingeman be not much kinder the evil be slapdash unfocused and eventually preposterous he write
king be a natural but he lack control he simply rear back and let fly with the fireball and a_lot of wild pitch result
the criticism apparently sting
sale be not all important king later tell lingeman
we all want_to be nominate for a national book award
i grow_up read king and the literary establishment have gradually come around in 2003 the national book foundation award him a medal for distinguished contribution to american letter
the ballad of jail reading
in next_week 's issue lauren groff will review peter orner 's new story collection
last car over the sagamore bridge
orner have never hit the best seller list despite critical acclaim but he do have a recent brush with the wild side of popular fiction as the expert witness in a lawsuit involve a california prisoner 's right to read werewolf erotica
the plaintiff an inmate at pelican bay state prison successfully appeal after his copy of mathilde madden 's silver crown be confiscate
at stake in the case be the very tricky and very subjective issue of literary value orner tell_me via e_mail
as a fiction writer you_can not really say no when someone ask you to read some werewolf erotica especially for a good cause
and i would say the right to read wherever you be be a pretty_good cause
orner end_up tear through the book he say
i tend_to be a very slow reader
i read the silver crown fast the prose really move let_'s say
i_wish i have as much action in my_own book
orner study law and have work in prison both in a legal capacity and as a write teacher
he ' sympathetic he tell_me to their challenge
but he would tend_to allow most book
correctional officer have to enforce discipline in an incredibly tough environment he say
pelican bay be one of the most violent prison in california
they have get some extraordinarily serious problem
my humble thought speak as a writer be that an inmate read a book about werewolf have sex be the least of their problem
i have plan to spend a week at the end of the summer on an island off the sicilian coast
sunny sky and blue water be to be follow by a night or two in palermo and a few_day in the countryside visit fabrizia lanza director of the anna tasca lanza cook school where the main activity be pick and cook vegetable from the garden for every meal
alas my summer whiz by and the vacation become an impossible mission
to console myself i begin to cook
with farmer_market produce at its_peak i can approximate some remember dish from previous visit and fabrizia 's cookbook come home to sicily fill in the blank by give actual recipe to follow
there be an_unusual pesto sauce from nearby trapani make with basil coarsely chop almond and ripe tomato
there be a zesty eggplant caponata and savory baked eggplant involtini
not so easy for a city cook to reproduce be a beautiful dish of artichokes roast on glow hot ember but i be go to try
the book be arrange by season so the reader get a sense of a work sicilian farm kitchen throughout the year begin with the first shoot of wild fennel in the spring and all the attendant seasonal project and ritual
of course there be fish dish and meat dish too most imbue with the scent of herb and garlic
but they have a definite southern sensibility strikingly different from northern italian cooking
i find_myself draw to a simple stovetop lamb stew call spezzatino di agnello season with only a pinch of saffron and a splash of wine then shower with lot_of chop mint
fabrizia cut lamb shoulder into cube to make this but since my butcher have beautiful thick cut shoulder chop i decide to make mine with those
once assemble this fragrant stew take only about an hour to cook
it have a bright flavored lightness that make it ideal for these still rather balmy september evening
i serve it with plain boil potato nothing more be need
while i will remember the summer of 2013 as the one i do_not spend in sicily the meal i have be cook lately have have a distinctly sicilian accent
this_year it seem the vacation be happen right in my_own kitchen
before i eat my way around catalonia i assume that the great and sadly late penelope casas recipe for romesco sauce from her book the foods and wines of spain be the only one i would ever need
deservedly a classic it_' a rich and piquant puree make from sweet dry spanish pepper along_with tomato garlic almond vinegar and oil pound with breadcrumb as a binder
it_' marvelous on simply cook fish tasty stir into seafood stew and make a fine top for pretty_much any vegetable sturdy enough to hold its_own against the thick pungent sauce
but once i get to catalonia i meet romescos of other persuasion
some be spicy and as runny as tomato sauce
some be as thick as hummus and smoky with char dry chile
one memorably complex version which i have write about before be spike with sweet almond biscuit and enrich with hard cook egg and garlic confit then dolloped on slim green onion call calcots
none of this be to knock ms. casas 's excellent recipe
nor do it imply that when it come to romesco sauce anything go
but it do give_me license to take a few liberty
the first be to skip the sweet dried pepper call noras that i have always think be essential
they be indeed very nice but also hard to come by unless you plan ahead not my strong suit
instead i substitute broil red bell pepper
not only do the fresh pepper add a fleshy sweetness and smokiness from the fire they be also plentiful this time of year and beg for a noble purpose
for a mild kick and to intensify the smokiness i throw in a bit of smoke hot paprika
and instead of almond or a mix of almond and hazelnut i rely solely on hazelnut for an earthier note
the result can be use nearly anywhere a brightly flavor sauce or condiment be require and will keep in the fridge for at_least a week
in her various book ms. casas recommend use romesco on grill tuna as a sauce for shrimp and lobster or slick over potato and green bean in a substantial salad
here i have toss it with quickly blanch broccoli which be crisp and light but hearty enough to stand_up to this very bold sauce

giglio italy after a costly painstaking and potentially perilous operation to raise the batter hull of the cruise_ship costa concordia engineer say early tuesday that they have succeed in right the ship remove it from two granite reef where it run aground last_year kill 32 people
the 19-hour highly complicated salvage operation have manage to completely rotate the ship lean it on an underwater platform build underneath the engineer say
this be an_important visible step franco gabrielli head of italy 's civil protection_agency tell_reporter at 4 a.m. accompany_by applause from a few resident who have stay up all night to follow the operation
the rotation happen in the way we think and hop it would happen echo franco porcellacchia project manager for costa cruises the ship 's operator
there be no_evidence so_far of any impact to the environment
if there be debris to be remove we will do it tomorrow
as part_of the vessel emerge in the late afternoon on_monday discolored and rusting from the water where the concordia have languish list on its side engineer say the operation would most_likely take long than initially plan
salvage expert have say the dimension of the stricken 951-foot vessel make the operation unparalleled in the annals of marine salvage as more_than 500 diver technician engineer and biologist prepare the ship for what be know as parbuckling to bring it upright and minimize environmental risk to giglio island a marine sanctuary
use huge jack cable pulley and specialized equipment the salvage effort have be set to begin at first light but a sudden storm prevent worker from move a barge and rubber boom close to the ship
three hour_after work start engineer say the first phase of the operation ease the vessel away_from its rocky perch be go accord_to plan
these hour be the most uncertain as we could_not establish how_much the hull be wedge say sergio girotto project manager with micoperi the project 's underwater construction and offshore contractor
now we have to guide it into the desire position
the next phase of the salvage engineer say involve settle the wreck on an artificial seabed make of bag of cement next to underwater steel platform
to achieve that the cruise liner need to be rotate about 65 degree they say
if it all go well the ship will be tow away and break up for scrap by spring
the operation be broadcast live on television and the internet
the italian news_medium portray the salvage as a chance for italy to revamp its image after the wreck in which the captain flee the damage ship and the evacuation be chaotic
the lead national daily corriere della sera call the shipwreck a monument to human stupidity and a humiliation for italy
it say it hop that the salvage effort would provide a new and different story for the country

the operation be monitor by engineer and remotely operate vehicle pilot from a control room on a barge close to the bow of the ship
if image or sonar show dangerous twisting the technician could adjust the process
at a command center onshore engineer could intervene if the ship do_not rotate or do_not rotate properly
salvage master and the italian authorities have prepare_for complication
most of the fuel be siphon off within month of the wreck
but the vessel that once transport and entertain 4,229 people still contain chemical and diesel fuel that could leak into the pristine water for which giglio a popular tourist spot be know
during the rotation process the region 's environmental agency take sample to monitor water quality
detach the ship from the rock be the most complicated phase which be probably why they decide to do it very cautiously say emilio campana the director of the research office for naval and maritime engineering at italy 's national research council
we have to keep in mind that the structure be heavily damaged and see if and how it hold together from now on
gaia pianigiani report_from giglio and alan cowell from london
berlin chancellor_angela merkel get good and bad_news on_sunday from germany_'s economically powerful state of bavaria her conservative allies capture an_absolute majority in election for the regional parliament but her current liberal partner in the national government fail to make the cut
in a race that be scrutinize as an indicator of the national mood before sunday 's federal election the disastrous showing of just 3_percent for the free_democrats well short of the 5_percent need to enter any german legislature make it less_likely that ms._merkel would be_able to form another coalition_government with them after the national vote
the christian social union the bavarian party that govern in partnership with ms._merkel 's christian democratic union secure 47.7 percent of the vote in the 180-seat state_legislature accord_to official result
that would translate_into 101 seat for the conservative 10 more_than need to form a majority government
the conservative party main rival the social_democrats win 20.6 percent of the vote or 42 seat accord_to the initial official result
that reverse a downward trend with credit universally give to christian ude a former journalist who have for 20_year be a highly popular mayor of munich
under germany_'s election system voter be_able to cast two vote one for a party and one for a candidate
this can lead to result in which the percentage of voter do_not always correlate directly with the number of seat a party win
the conservative party main rival the social_democrats win just over 20_percent of the vote on_sunday accord_to the initial official result
the year 2008 be history
we be back a beam horst seehofer bavaria 's state premier and leader of the christian social union say minute after the first exit poll herald his triumph
five_year ago the bavarian conservative lose the absolute majority they have enjoy for 56 year turn to the pro business free_democrats to form a government that mirror ms._merkel 's coalition in berlin
sunday 's outcome stir anxiety in berlin where the continuation of ms._merkel 's current coalition_government be dependent on a strong showing by the small party which have struggle at the national level
despite ms._merkel 's comfortable lead in the poll over her main rival peer_steinbrã¼ck concern be grow that she may have no choice but to try_to form a government with his center leave social democratic_party if the free_democrats fail to make the crucial 5_percent threshold or barely cross it
the free democratic_party 's leader philipp rã¶sler seek to rally supporter nationwide by single out bavaria as unique
we all know that thing be different in bavaria and from now on it_' all about germany mr. rã¶sler say add that this result be a wake_up call
the greens receive about 8.5 percent of the vote while the free voters a bavarian party that oppose germany_'s euro_zone policy hover around 9_percent the state election monitor say on its web_site
the mood for a change in the land be just not there say theresa schopper a greens leader in bavaria in an unusually frank assessment
her party have struggle nationally this_year in part_because of a poorly communicate message widely see as raise tax for many
the conservative strong showing will not_necessarily translate_into equal success for ms._merkel next_week
there be some fear that bavarians who make up germany_'s second strong voting bloc could be less inclined to go to the poll two week in a row
and those_who want_to see the free_democrats hang on may well use their second party vote that way rather_than cast it for ms._merkel 's party
at her party 's headquarters in berlin on_sunday night the tension be palpable
in_addition mr. seehofer 's strength could prove a problem for ms._merkel even_if she be return to office
his interpretation of conservatism have remain more traditional while she have steer her party toward more leftist issue like create more publicly run day care center and decide to shut_down germany_'s nuclear_power plant
while bavaria 's capital munich have become a diverse metropolitan area home to some of germany_'s most powerful industrial and high_tech company much of the rest of the state be rural and socially conservative
the area still hold strong tie to the roman_catholic church and its unique cultural identity stem_from its history as an_independent kingdom
bavaria have the low unemployment_rate of germany_'s 16 state with only 3.8 percent of its 12.5 million inhabitant out of work and there have be grow unease in the state with germany_'s system under which economically strong state distribute some of their tax earnings among weak region
london in an old church annex in northwest london the wall of the cutler gross office be line with color eyewear that look_like fragment of stain glass window
the analogy be apt as ever_since 1969 when the optician graham cutler and tony gross set_up a store in the upscale knightsbridge district the brand have exhibit an almost religious fervor about handmade glass
today with the 30-year veteran marie wilkinson as its design director the company continue to sell its_own 1,000 style while expand relationship_with some of fashion 's trendy designer
the license with giles deacon thomas tait victoria beckham and maison martin margiela be not especially lucrative say majid mohammadi the company 's co owner and chief_executive
but they do allow the eyewear maker to develop design with like minded creative people_who buy the glass for resale under their_own label
work on eyewear help designer articulate their point of view and they in turn be ambassador for wear glass ms. wilkinson explain
mr. deacon say he have be wear the company 's logo free frame for year before he approach the executive in_2009 seek a collaboration
i have always really respect the quality and the simplicity of the design that they make he say
they come from an aesthetic which be just a bit different from the norm which i_think be really attractive
he_add that he feel comfortable share his offbeat reference from kurt cobain to the scooby doo character velma with someone like ms. wilkinson
for mr. deacon 's spring 2013 collection cutler gross create oversize round glass that feature inlaid pearl and crystal above the brow
as mr. mohammadi describe it the designer value the company 's quality over quantity approach
we can_not do mass production and distribution
we be like savile row suit rather_than boss suit which he continue may be very_good but they_'re not handmade that ' the bottom line
everything from mill lens groove to fit hinge be do by its craftsman in italy where the brand own two factory
the second site establish only this_year in the northern city of cadore have allow specialist like metalworker or artisan who cut acetate to work together
but with production base in italy why keep the design team in london
it come down to the heritage say ms. wilkinson and the english mixture of irreverence and correctness that be a hallmark of design by mr._cutler and mr. gross

paris secretary of state_john kerry and the foreign_minister of france and britain say on_monday that they would not tolerate delay in dismantle syria_'s chemical_weapon and would press_ahead with a strong resolution in the united_nations security_council to enforce the disarmament plan
it be extremely important that there be no evasion william hague the british foreign secretary say at a joint news_conference
refer_to president_bashar al_assad of syria mr._kerry say if assad fail in time to abide by the term of this framework make no mistake we be all agree and that include russia that there will be consequence
a major question however be whether the united_states and its allies be pursue the short_term goal of dismantle syria_'s chemical_arsenal at the expense of their ultimate objective of press mr._assad to relinquish power
the schedule for eliminate syria_'s chemical_weapon be ambitious all of them be to be eliminate by the middle of 2014
and expert say that meeting such a schedule will depend heavily on the cooperation of the assad_government
laurent fabius the french foreign_minister insist_that there be no contradiction between the disarmament goal and the long_term diplomatic objective because remove mr._assad 's chemical_arsenal would undermine his military position and would eventually smooth the way for his ouster
it will be a weakening of his position mr._fabius say
he must understand that there be no military victory
mr._kerry make a similar point
we be take a weapon away_from him that he have be use against his people he say while acknowledge_that the syrian military have also use conventional artillery and airstrikes indiscriminately against the population
mr._fabius emphasize the importance of increase support for the syrian_opposition much of which have express a sense of betrayal over the united_states decision to put off a military_strike
in order to negotiate a political solution we_need a strong position mr._fabius say
we therefore intend_to strengthen our support to syrian national coalition rebel
if_you want_to change the assad_regime without fall in the hand of the terrorist you have to support the moderate opposition
mr._fabius remark that much of the public appear to think that the choice in syria be between mr._assad 's government and islamic militant but he say that be false
mr._fabius say the syrian_opposition would be invite to an international meeting in new_york that would be convene on the margin of the united_nations general_assembly whose formal session open next_week and be schedule to continue into early october
the framework plan on quarantining and destroy syria_'s chemical_arsenal be work out by the united_states and russia on_saturday but now need to be incorporate into a security_council resolution
under the framework_agreement the term of the accord be to be include in a resolution under chapter 7 of the united_nations charter which would authorize punitive measure if syria do_not comply
while russia would almost_certainly veto any security_council endorsement of a military_strike other measure could include disrupt syria_'s mean of communication as_well as impose economic sanction
in_addition mr._kerry have say the united_states remain prepared to launch a unilateral strike if syria fail to meet its commitment
mr._kerry say that every representation of compliance by the syrian_government would be verify
nothing can be accept at face value or in word alone he say
mr. hague add that britain france and the united_states be intent on prevent syria from engage_in a cat and mouse game

the world must be prepare to hold them to account if_they do_n't and our three country be certainly determined to do so
new delhi india 's main inflation rate hit a six_month high in_august drive by a surprise surge in food price harden the case for the central_bank 's governor raghuram rajan to keep interest_rate high at his first policy meeting this_week
food inflation accelerate to a three_year high of 18.18 percent in_august government data release on_monday show drive overall inflation to a high than expect 6.1 percent
recent government move to increase fuel price also drive the jump in the wholesale price index the price of a representative basket of wholesale good
economist poll by reuters have expect a headline reading of 5.8 percent compare_with 5.79 percent in_july
the main or headline inflation rate include food price which be often volatile
late planting and disruption in the supply of vegetable include onion because of heavy summer rain have fuel food inflation
onion price jump 51 percent from july to august
monday 's release be the last major data point before mr. rajan a former i.m.f. chief_economist hold his first policy meeting friday
development in the currency market suggest_that r.b.i. should be in a position to start reverse its tightening measure
however they have to be careful as market could interpret it as tolerate high inflation say a. prasanna an_economist with icici securities primary dealership in mumbai refer_to the central_bank the reserve_bank of india
the high inflation number dampen market expectation that mr. rajan would begin to roll back some of the measure put in place by his_predecessor in a bid to arrest a sharp decline in the rupee since may.
he have_already warn he do_not have a magic wand to deal_with india 's economic_crisis but as he have be dub the guv by a gush indian medium hope be high he can find a formula to stabilize the rupee calm inflationary pressure and at the same_time set_off a revival in economic_growth
before he reveal his monetary stance mr. rajan will first have to deal_with the outcome of a pivotal meeting on_tuesday and wednesday of the u.s. federal_reserve
the fed be likely_to announce measure to rein in its huge economic_stimulus

paris policy_maker be hop a general_election next sunday in germany will allow the important business of integrate europe to finally move_forward but they hardly expect a radical shift in germany_'s stance on major issue
from athens to lisbon and paris to rome government want berlin get behind a banking union and also adopt a more expansionist economic_policy to help drive growth and fight unemployment in stagnant euro_zone economy
european official largely expect chancellor_angela merkel to win a third_term
many hope that ms._merkel a conservative will have to form a grand_coalition with the center leave social_democrats or s.p.d. whose pro europe leaning tend_to make them more open to stimulus measure than the current partner in the govern coalition the center right free democratic_party or f.d.p.
but even_if ms._merkel be force to team up with the more liberal s.p.d. germany_'s stance on major european issue be unlikely to shift
whoever be elect the constraint that merkel have face will remain the same for any german government say sylvie goulard a french representative to the european_parliament who be a member of the liberal democratic movement party
hostile public_opinion and institution that strictly interpret european_union law will_continue to bind germany_'s movement make it difficult for the government to share the financial burden of fellow euro_zone member
ms._merkel and her s.p.d. challenger peer_steinbrã¼ck barely mention european and foreign_policy in their only television debate except to agree that germany should have no part in any military response to the use of chemical_weapon in syria
mr._steinbrã¼ck accuse ms._merkel of bungle the euro_zone crisis by go slow and inflict a poisonous dose of austerity measure on greece and other bail out country
he keep silent about s.p.d. 's support for pool some euro_zone debt sense a vote loser
the chancellor note_that the s.p.d. have vote for all of her euro_zone bailout proposal but she offer no personal vision of europe 's future
with the survival of the common currency no_longer under threat and financial_market calm for now policy_maker expect ms._merkel to stick to her small step approach to euro_zone integration unless the crisis flare again
the need for further financial support for greece portugal and perhaps ireland will cause much grumpy debate in berlin
frustration at chronic italian political instability and french aversion to liberal economic change will smolder
perhaps as important for german policy as the election result may be a ruling by the federal constitutional court next_month on the european central_bank 's effort to hold euro_zone member 's borrowing cost in check by buy their bond which calm the crisis when the e.c.b. president mario draghi announce the initiative last_year
the german court be not expect to declare the bond_buy illegal but it may set condition that could make the policy hard to implement
germany will build europe at its_own pace and on its_own term
the others need to swallow and understand this say ulrike guerot who_represent germany on the european council on foreign_relations
if_they try_to rush us it will take long
at the same_time berlin be expect to continue to insist_that europe be give bind control over national budget as a condition for provide financial support to other euro_zone member she_say
divergent view hold by germany and the rest of the world as to the cause of the european debt crisis will also slow any progress

the u.s. federal_reserve remain the most powerful central_bank in the world
its policy action reverberate in every corner of the globe something no other central_bank can claim
even the hint of a taper the withdrawal of easy money policy have roil emerge_market
the prospect of rise interest_rate in the united_states have lead investor to pull back from risky investment in those country
emerge_market like brazil india and indonesia be face plunge currency and decline stock_market
low interest_rate in the united_states have lead investor to look to emerge_market for better return on their money fuel boom in equity and real_estate market as_well as high inflation in some country
for the previous two_year emerge_market have be complain_about how these inflow fuel by cheap money in the united_states cause their currency to appreciate too rapidly hurt their export competitiveness
the fact_that those same currency be now tumble have lead to the opposite complaint that the fed should back off more slowly from its earlier policy and better communicate its intention to financial_market
give the global impact of the fed_'s action the choice of a replacement for ben bernanke as chairman of the federal_reserve be be watch with keen interest
no_matter who be choose there be important change in store for central_bank and financial_market the world over
despite the global economic_crisis financial_market be now more closely connect then ever before
china india and other major economy have continue remove restriction to capital flow open up their market to cross border investment
give this increased mobility action by any of the major central_bank have effect well beyond their_own national border
moreover in the aftermath of the crisis central_bank have become even more important to economic management take on much of the burden of control inflation improve financial stability and promote growth
this be a difficult balancing act in the best of time
it become virtually impossible when fiscal and other policy be work at cross purpose
in the united_states for_instance short_term fiscal tightening along_with the uncertainty associate_with deficit and debt_ceiling negotiation that repeatedly go down to the wire have hobble the recovery
meanwhile little have be do to tackle the long_term fiscal problem especially entitlement spending
the focus_on short_term austerity have limit productivity enhance expenditure in such area as infrastructure and education
in india the government have be unwilling to undertake politically unpopular reform to tackle large budget deficit and structural problem such as stifle labor_market regulation
this have leave it to the maker of monetary_policy to do all the heavy lifting
other emerge_market face similar issue
the reliance on central_bank to make up for the failing of other policy have create inevitable international tension
the right monetary_policy for one country may not_necessarily be what be good for another
unlike fiscal policy whose effect tend_to stay mostly domestic monetary_policy do affect currency value and financial_market in other country through cross border financial flow
whoever take_over from bernanke the reality be that the fed chairman have a mandate to focus only on domestic objective
fair enough no central_bank in the world have anything but domestic objective in its mandate
but when the fed act it matter to the world in a way that no other central_bank 's action do
in a report by a committee of academic and former central banker in which i participate we argue_that the fed and a small_group of central_bank from both advance and emerge_market economy should hold regular meeting and issue a report on their monetary_policy intention
even_if this procedure only expose mutual inconsistency in policy it would be a way to bring broad pressure_on politician to stop rely_on the crutch of monetary_policy and prod them to take politically unpopular measure to improve productivity and the prospect of long_term growth while make global capital flow more stable
so who would the rest of the world vote for to head the most_important central_bank
now that lawrence summers have withdraw_from the race the presumptive front_runner be janet yellen
many central banker view her as someone_who be empathetic to the spillover effect of u.s. policy someone_who have enough credibility to soothe financial_market and ably steer the fed
in any event no_matter who get the job what many of the world 's central banker be hop for be a fed that can go_back to the more mod objective of maintain low inflation and financial stability
on that at_least there be certainly international agreement

on_friday i awake to find them battle each_other on your view page in the form of an_article by president_vladimir putin a plea for caution from russia
there will always be war
and we_'re likely_to see more effort to attain and deploy weapon of mass_destruction
but so long as the superpower duel in the newspaper the prospect for both peace and the press would appear to have brighten
john brown munich
in that threat work sept._13 nicholas d. kristof suggest a three track strategy in syria that include expand support of moderate rebel
that be precisely the wrong strategy
it be not in america_'s interest to see a rebel victory which will bring either islamic militant to power or chaos
our choice be not between bad and good dictatorship and democracy it_' between bad and bad
to that end we_should not arm the rebel moderate or otherwise
many of the rebel may be moderate even believer in some form of democracy without the slight notion of what that be or how to get there
but many be also islamic extremist bend on do away with a secular regime
the best outcome for the united_states and i believe for the syrian people would be a negotiate settlement in which president_bashar al_assad or his government remain in power but with some form of constraint

president_obama recently declare that the united_states be the world 's old constitutional democracy and he be echo by timothy egan a brilliant mess sept._14 without challenge
it be nonetheless a historically dubious claim
that honor may belong_to either iceland or switzerland though the detail be open to debate
but since the united_states do_not allow equal voting right for all its citizen until 1965 its democracy by that standard must be count young
and true democracy still elude the country when money be consider a form of free speech and representation of the poor be subject to open mockery

as video_game player have get old as antihero have become routine across the culture as sex and violence have permeate prestige television the controversy that once surround the grand_theft auto game have begin to seem_like sepia tone oddity from another age
sure the new installment to be release on_tuesday contain plenty that may offend those_who enjoy take offense and it be still disturbing to see parent give these game to preteenage child
among the interactive pastime grand_theft auto offer alongside pursuit like yoga sky diving tennis scuba and golf be bong hit and lap dance
but while the franchise have lose the ability_to shock it remain the most immersive spectacle in interactive entertainment
and with the profane and hugely enjoyable grand_theft auto v rockstar games have produce the best plot most playable character drive fictionally coherent entry in this 16-year old series
the game be set in an immense parodic vision of southern_california a west_coast counterpoint to the caricature of new_york city in grand_theft auto iv 2008
while los santos the game 's version_of los_angeles and its surroundings exist in an alternate reality it be also a contemporary one that evoke and satirize the anxiety of 21st_century life
there_' a fake facebook lifeinvader a fake twitter bleeter a fake apple fruit a fake kickstarter beseecher a fake 50 shade of grey chain of intimacy even a fake call of duty righteous slaughter 7 a first person shooter game that advertise itself with the tagline the identical art of contemporary killing
grand_theft auto v be still an action game about hoodlum and thief we start with an_extended bout of cop killing and proceed to a series of increasingly ambitious heist
but the structure feel more logical than before
your character do_not arrive as an outsider in a new city and start carry_out the request of people whose only purpose be seemingly to delay him
instead the event flow from situation and desire
for the first_time there be three controllable character instead of only one franklin a repo man on the make lose his job michael a witness protection retiree miscalculates after find his_wife cheat on him with her tennis instructor and trevor an oddly lovable psychopathic meth dealer and gun runner learn that michael his onetime partner fake his_death 10_year ago
i_'ve get an imbalance michael tell his psychiatrist
one minute i be one person and the next minute i be another person
a retire or newly unretired bank robber michael be examine his struggle to control his criminal impulse
he may as_well be analyze the dissonance that afflict grand_theft auto iv. that game 's protagonist niko bellic would fret in animate sequence about the cost of his life of violence
but under the control of many video_game player niko would subsequently embark_on act of gleeful creative murder that belie the story the game want_to tell about him
be these two man the one in the story 's animation and the one manipulate by the player really the same person
with the three character structure of grand_theft auto v rockstar find an answer to that riddle
that seamlessness between narrative and interactive be something that we have work on everywhere say sam houser the sometimes reclusive co founder of rockstar games who agree to be interview after i have spend_more than 45 hour inside the game 's world
most video_game be about repeat action about master a skill and exploit it
grand_theft auto game be about variety
there_' the array of content include radio station d.j.'d by the like of bootsy collins entire tv show with name like republican space rangers and a fake internet
and there be the mission the character execute encompass car boat and plane chase paparazzo ambush train robbery and triathlons
failure in the new game be less frustrating than in previous iteration since a generous checkpointing system mean that player do_not need to restart a mission from the beginning if_they do_not get it right the first_time
there_' even an option to skip the action sequence after repeat attempt have go awry
for all that the game do right it have a genuinely problematic aspect that be not its enthusiasm_for violence or sex but its lack of interest in woman as something other than lustful airhead notwithstanding a late game cameo by mr. houser 's mother geraldine moffat a british actress of the 1960 and 70s
one of the only young_woman in the game not oversexed and under read be suck into a jet turbine 1_2 next_page

mr._obama 's remark follow his administration_'s release of a report chronicle the action take since 2008 to encourage job creation save the auto industry revive and regulate banking and expand education opportunity
but he speak at a time when the economy as he acknowledge be still struggle to create enough job and his agenda face opposition mostly from republicans but also from some democrats increasingly embolden against a second term lame duck president
still on the budget fight most democrats in congress support the president and with his comment he seek to rally them and to set_up republicans for blame should the fiscal fight end badly
mr._obama note_that in the past republicans fight for more spending_cut to reduce deficit but that now with annual deficit decline they be make their fight over the health_care law
the affordable_care act have be the law for three and a half year now mr._obama say
it pass both house of congress
the supreme_court rule it constitutional
it be an issue in last_year 's election and the candidate who call for repeal lose
the republicans in the house have try_to repeal or sabotage it about 40 time
they fail every time
meanwhile the law have_already help million of americans
the president repeat his warning against self inflict wound at the event which be move from the rose garden to the eisenhower executive office_building because of rain
he proceed with the event even as a shooting unfold at a naval office_building in southeast washington

the president have struggle for year to balance the desire to claim credit for a slowly improve economy against the need to make_sure he acknowledge the pain that many_people still feel
at the event on_monday mr._obama recall how close the country and the world come to another depression after the collapse of the investment bank lehman brothers in september 2008
the lehman bankruptcy cause the credit market to seize up the unemployment_rate to sour and economic activity to plummet
mr._obama and his allies have for a long time say that the administration_'s action in early 2009 while extremely unpopular be critical to hold off a bad collapse
those include the decision to support president_george w._bush 's bailout of wall_street mr._obama 's own bailout for the auto industry and the passage of the economic_stimulus program
but while the unemployment_rate have fall to 7.3 percent down from a high of 10.1 percent in late 2009 million of americans be still struggle to find a job and million more be work at low wage or part time job and have trouble make end meet
that have be mr._obama 's message in the last several_month as he have deliver speech argue for what he call a better bargain for the middle_class
in those speech he argue for investment in infrastructure education college aid and housing as a way to help middle_class americans and those try_to get into the middle_class

a united_nations report release on_monday confirm that a deadly chemical arm attack cause a mass killing in syria last_month and for the first_time provide extensive forensic detail of the weapon use which strongly implicate the syrian_government
while the report 's author do_not assign blame for the attack on the outskirt of damascus the detail it document include the large size and particular shape of the munition and the precise direction from which two of them have be fire
take together that information appear to undercut argument by president_bashar al_assad of syria that rebel force who be not know to possess such weapon or the training or ability_to use them have be responsible
the report commission by secretary_general ban ki moon be the first independent on the ground scientific inquest into the attack which leave hundred_of civilian gas to death include child early on_aug. 21
the repercussion have elevate the 30-month old syrian conflict into a global political crisis that be test the limit of impunity over the use of chemical_weapon
it could also lead to the first concerted action on the war at the united_nations security_council which up to now have be paralyze over syria policy
the report make for chilling reading mr. ban tell a news_conference after he brief the security_council
the finding be beyond doubt and beyond the pale
this be a war_crime
mr. ban decline to ascribe blame say that responsibility be up to others but he express hope that the attack would become a catalyst for a new diplomatic determination at the united_nations to resolve the syrian conflict which have leave more_than 100,000 people dead and million displace
there be no immediate reaction to the report_from the syrian_government
but just two day_before the report be release syria officially agree to join the international convention on ban chemical_weapon and the united_states and russia which have repeatedly clash over syria agree on a plan to identify and purge those weapon from the country by the middle of next_year
syria have say it would abide by that plan
the main point of the report be to establish whether chemical_weapon have be use in the aug._21 attack in the damascus suburb of ghouta an area long infiltrate by rebel
the united_nations inspector conclude_that chemical_weapon have be use in the ongoing conflict between the party in the syrian arab republic also against civilian include child on a relatively large_scale
the weapon inspector who visit ghouta and leave the country with large amount_of evidence on_aug. 31 say in particular the environmental chemical and medical sample we have collect provide clear and convincing evidence_that surface to surface rocket contain the nerve agent sarin be use
but the report 's annex detail what the author find be what catch the attention of nonproliferation expert
in two chilling piece of information the inspector say that the remnant of a warhead they have find show its capacity of sarin to be about 56 liter far high than initially think
they also say that fall temperature at the time of the attack ensure_that the poison_ga heavy than air would hug the ground penetrate low_level of building where many_people be seek shelter
the investigator be unable_to examine all of the munition use but they be_able to find and measure several rocket or their component
use standard field technique for ordnance identification and crater analysis they establish that at_least two type_of rocket have be use include an m14 artillery rocket bear cyrillic marking and a 330-millimeter rocket of unidentified provenance
these finding though not present as evidence of responsibility be likely_to strengthen the argument of those_who claim that the syrian_government bear the blame because the weapon in question have not be previously document or report to be in possession of the insurgency 1_2 next_page

in this demoralizing situation i tell myself again and again that i be fight as a jew with them but not as one of them
i dream of have my_own country of fighting for it and even die for it

if there be a lesson to be glean it be that no person should succumb to brutality without put up a resistance he write in his book
individually it can save one 's life en masse it can change the course of history
the question be about the future and carmelo anthony respond with four word of practice reassurance
i_'m not go nowhere he tell bloomberg television last_week in an_attempt to soothe the nerve of antsy knicks fan
strain syntax aside it be the sensible thing to say perhaps the only thing to say
it may even be true although predict the whim of an n.b.a. superstar be always a dicey proposition
ten month from now anthony will_probably opt out of his knicks contract sign a five_year deal for $ 129 million and happily resume his role as the basketball prince of broadway
anthony love new_york and new_york love anthony playoff failure notwithstanding
he have every reason to stay the money the market the chance to be the savior who end the knicks 40-year championship drought
it be only two and a half year_ago that anthony force the denver nuggets to send_him here
it seem unlikely he would leave so soon
but a_lot can change in 10 month and the specter of anthony 's free agency will shadow the knicks all season just as the threat of his departure loom over the nuggets three_year ago
the circumstance be different of course
anthony flee denver for reason beyond basketball
his_wife lala an actress want the broadway spotlight
carmelo want the madison_avenue connection
as anthony mention in that same interview last_week out there in denver from a business standpoint i do_not have all of the outlet that i have right_now in new_york
i be not able_to take_advantage of all the opportunity and all the people that i know here in new_york
those be powerful force and anthony may stay base_on those consideration alone
but when the fashion show be over and all the shoe have be sell there will still be basketball to be play
that be where the uncertainty lie
the knicks be 7 14 in the playoff since anthony arrive with two first_round exit
they win 54 game last_season their best record in decade but they hit that mark in a down year for the eastern conference and still fail to reach the conference final
the knicks may have_already peak
their chief rival have only grow strong
the indiana pacers who oust the knicks in the semifinal have since add luis scola and will welcome back a healthy danny granger
the chicago bull will have derrick rose back
the nets have add paul pierce kevin garnett and andrei kirilenko
the miami heat still have lebron james
the knicks improve marginally add metta world peace beno udrih and andrea bargnani while lose jason kidd chris copeland and steve novak
but kidd 's departure and the retirement of kurt thomas and rasheed wallace leave a huge leadership gap in a locker_room desperate for cool head and wise word
it be kidd who coax j. r. smith and anthony into a smart team orient game last_season and it be kidd who help keep the combustible smith on course
the knicks may have the high volatility index in the league with world peace smith and kenyon martin
the roster be deep but awkwardly assemble
amar'e stoudemire be a poor fit between anthony and tyson chandler but he may be even bad on a second unit with bargnani another scoring minded defensively challenge big man
the glut of power forward may push anthony back to small forward rob the knicks of the explosive small lineup that prove so effective last_season
the knicks be still miss a true co star for anthony
their second best scorer be the flighty smith who will open this_season with a five game drug suspension
how patient will anthony be
he turn 30 in may.
his next contract be likely_to be his last as an elite player
if a championship be his goal he have to wonder whether the knicks have the vision and the flexibility to surround him with the right player
as it stand the knicks appear no close to championship contention today than they be a year_ago
the franchise will have a chance to reboot in 2015 when the contract of chandler stoudemire and bargnani expire create enough salary cap room to sign another star or two
but that opportunity be two_year away and anthony have not show an appetite for rebuild
he have cite the nuggets plan overhaul in_2011 as the reason for his trade demand
anthony will be eligible_for an extension feb. 22 and he could remove any doubt about his intention by sign then
but he stand to make much_more by opt out in_july and he will almost_certainly wait
in the meantime what if the knicks crash and burn
what if stoudemire 's knee give out again
what if smith fail another drug test
what if as many commentator expect the knicks fall a few notch and cede the spotlight to the rival nets
what if_they lose in the first_round next_spring
how secure will anthony feel about his future then
new_york be still new_york
but there be another city that can offer heady dos of fame fortune and brand promotion and it happen to be home to the n.b.a. 's most glamorous franchise
the los_angeles lakers will have million in salary cap room next summer and a powerful recruiter in kobe bryant one of anthony 's close_friend
per n.b.a. rule the lakers could offer anthony only $ 96 million over four_year
but they can offer something the knicks can_not a tradition of success a knack for acquire and build around superstar and a habit of stag parade in_june
maybe anthony be not go anywhere as he assert last_week
but verbal commitment and loyalty be malleable concept in professional sport
nothing mean anything until the contract be sign
berlin this_week transatlantic trends publish the annual public_opinion survey conduct_by the german marshall fund of the united_states
the trend be always fascinating because_they give a sense of public_opinion attitude on both_side of the atlantic and how wide or narrow those difference be over certain foreign_policy issue
this_year the survey focus mostly on the war in syria and other issue concern the middle_east
accord_to a preview of the data it be clear that in europe the public be highly skeptical of any military intervention in syria
on average 70_percent of those ask in 10 european country and turkey oppose intervention
the trend show that european public do_not trust the use of force say ian lesser director of the german marshall fund 's brussels office
this have serious implication for european foreign defense and security policy he_add
europe 's ambition to develop a coherent foreign and security policy recently take a battering when the leader of the european_union 's two most_important military power britain and france fail to win public support for a military_strike against syria
david_cameron the british prime_minister suffer a humiliating defeat by lawmaker during a vote on british participation in a possible airstrike lead by the united_states against syria
conservative lawmaker say the vote show not only that mr._cameron be unable_to control his_own backbencher but also that he have underestimate the increase tendency toward isolationism include anti americanism in his_own political camp
the british public react to the vote with enormous relief
in a country that lose hundred_of troop in afghanistan every public_opinion poll have show that britain be not prepare to back the united_states with troop again especially as the obama_administration seem prepared to bypass the united_nations security_council
franã§ois hollande the french president have remain commit to the possibility of military_action even as the united_states and russia negotiate how to persuade syria to relinquish its chemical_arsenal
when mr. hollande intervene in mali this_year he have wide public support
but syria be a different matter
the transatlantic trends report show that 65_percent of those poll in france oppose any intervention
it be become much_more difficult to get public support for the use of force say henrik heidenkamp security expert at the royal united services institute in london
in the foreseeable future no british leader will dare commit the country to use force before take public_opinion into account
analyst wonder whether mr. hollande would indeed take the risk in intervene in syria without public support
bypass the public could turn_into too_much of a political risk
what seem to be happen be that voter across europe be begin to resemble the germans in their attitude toward the military
they be become more cautious inward look and reluctant to use force
this be heighten by a sharp sense of disappointment with president_obama 's foreign_policy as the transatlantic trends report suggest
chancellor_angela merkel of germany who be seek re_election for a third_term on_sunday at no time allow herself to be draw into any debate about the use of force
she know full well that german public_opinion be strongly against any military_action
even the chemical_weapon attack do_not seem to shock german all that much despite their abhorrence over how the nazis use such deadly weapon during world_war ii. not only do the europeans not back any military effort they do_not seem all that engage_in the diplomatic effort either
with few exception there be no push by european_union member state or catherine ashton the union 's foreign_policy chief to pursue the diplomatic channel or to propose that syria_'s chemical_weapon stockpile be bring under international inspection
europe be not pursue all the diplomatic and political option say marcin terlikowski security expert at the polish institute of international affairs
in the end it be president_vladimir v._putin of russia harshly criticize by the united_states for support the syrian president who take center stage by propose international supervision of the chemical_weapon
these trend may be point to a new europe in which the political resolve for serious diplomacy be lack among the european_union 's 28 member state and the conviction to enforce international weapon convention be largely absent
these trend be not comfort to the obama_administration
over the past several year u.s. defense_secretary have repeatedly criticize their european allies for be unwilling to spend_more on defense share scarce military resource or make tough decision about the use of force
yet if europe as a whole be become more skeptical of the military the late transatlantic trends report show that the american public also increasingly oppose the use of force at_least when it come to syria
accord_to the survey 62 percent of americans poll oppose military intervention compare to 55 percent a year_ago
give this war weariness it be hardly surprising that mr._obama postpone seek a vote from congress
this aversion to force say analyst may reflect a grow realization that military force carry a very high price though it often yield only limited result
force can overthrow dictator as in the case of iraq and libya or the taliban in afghanistan
but the instability now in all three country have as the transatlantic trends report show encourage skepticism among europeans and americans about the use of force
if european refuse_to consider force as a last option to support diplomatic effort analyst believe_that the european_union 's foreign_policy will be toothless

federal health official report monday that at_least two million americans fall ill from antibiotic resistant bacteria every year and that at_least 23,000 die from those infection put a hard number on a grow public_health threat
it be the first_time that federal authorities quantify the effect of organism that many antibiotic be powerless to fight
the number of death be substantially low than previous estimate in part_because researcher from the centers for disease control and prevention strip out case in which a drug_resistant infection be present but not_necessarily the cause of death
infectious disease doctor have long warn_that antibiotic resistance in which bacteria develop defense against antibiotic use to kill them threaten to return society to a time when people die from ordinary infection
they have come_up with hard number where it have be only guesswork say dr. stuart b. levy a professor of microbiology at tufts university and the president of the alliance for the prudent use of antibiotics
this set a baseline we can all believe in
in 2007 the c.d.c. estimate that about 100,000 people die every year of infection they develop while in hospital
most of those infection be believe to be resistant to some antibiotic but not_necessarily the most widely use one
and it be unclear how_many of the death be cause_by the drug_resistant infection
monday 's report quantify that
dr. steven l. solomon the director of the c.d.c. 's_office of antimicrobial resistance acknowledge_that the report underestimate the number but say that be by design
researcher be instruct to be conservative and to base their calculation only on death that be a direct result of a drug_resistant bacterial infection
this be a floor dr. solomon say
we_want the clean number the least subjective number
one point of contention have be the extent to which industrial scale animal farming contribute to the problem of antibiotic resistant infection in human
the government have estimate that more_than 70_percent of antibiotic in the united_states be give to animal
company use them to prevent sickness when animal be pack together in way that breed infection
they also use them to make animal grow faster though federal authorities be try_to stop that
the report say that much of antibiotic use in animal be unnecessary and inappropriate and make everyone less safe
it also say that about half of antibiotic use in people be inappropriate
the 114-page report count infection from 17 drug_resistant bacteria and one fungus pathogens that dr. solomon say cause an overwhelming majority of drug_resistant bacterial infection in the country
it draw on data from five disease tracking system include a major count of bacterial infection report in hospital in 10 different area across the country
the count of death be base_on mathematical model one for each resistant organism
one particularly lethal type_of drug_resistant bacteria know as cre have become resistant to nearly all antibiotic on the market
it be still relatively rare cause just 600 death a year but researcher have identify it in health_care facility in 44 state
we be get close and close to the cliff say dr. michael bell a c.d.c. official who present the data
infection from one of the most pervasive type_of drug_resistant bacteria track in the report mrsa have be decline
invasive mrsa infection in hospital go down by more_than half from 2005 to 2011 accord_to a paper publish monday in the journal jama internal medicine
however the number of invasive mrsa infection pick_up outside health_care setting have not change much and researcher point_out that the number of those type_of infection have for the first_time outstrip the number acquire in hospital
this be a really big switch say eli perencevich an infectious disease epidemiologist at the university of iowa
hospital have take step to prevent drug_resistant infection but less be know about prevent infection outside hospital clinic and nursing home
there have be little research for_example on the extent to which antibiotic use on industrial farm contribute to resistant germ in people
the farm animal industry have be reluctant to allow data collection and very few study of the link have be do
in a separate study in jama internal medicine on_monday researcher from the johns_hopkins bloomberg school of public_health sift through health record of more_than 440,000 people in the geisinger health system which operate a network of clinic and hospital in pennsylvania and find that patient who_live near farm and area_where manure be dump be 38 percent more_likely to develop a mrsa infection particularly of soft tissue or skin researcher find
some researcher not involve in the study say it offer evidence_that live near farm increase one 's chance of develop a mrsa infection
but the study do_not test farm animal or soil for mrsa nor do it find evidence of the type_of mrsa that be typically associate_with farm animal and others say the infection may have be cause_by something other than antibiotic on farm

after several year track orangutan in the sumatran swampland researcher make some surprising discovery they report in the journal plos one male make travel plan up to 24_hour in advance and share them with nearby orangutan by emit long loud call that can be hear more_than a half mile_away
their cheek pad act as a funnel amplify their call like a megaphone
male emit long call mostly face the direction they travel a few_hour later or even after a night 's rest say one of the researcher karin isler of the anthropological institute and museum in zurich
hear a call interested female may come closer to stay in contact while nondominant male may flee to avoid a confrontation
the orangutan usually travel about a half mile a day often look for fruit from tree
there be numerous example of planning in animal specie
a zoo chimpanzee for_example be observe gather stone and chunk of concrete before the zoo open for later use as ammunition against visitor
in experiment bonobo and chimpanzee be also find to select and store tool to use in the future
western scrub jay and eurasian jay be also know to plan in advance
dr. isler say the new study drive home the point that we_should not underestimate these magnificent creature and also other animal

i lay on my back with my teeth clenched and my hand grip the side of a hospital bed
a crowd of stranger in white coat fill the tiny room
wave of pain lap from my abdomen into my chest as the venom work its way toward my_heart
an experimental antivenin drug be about to be inject into my bloodstream and while i wait for the needle to go in i reflect that if anyone in the world be the right person to be bite by a black_widow spider i be that guy
as a professional outdoorsman i spend a_lot of time around thing that can bite claw stab or otherwise attack me
i have be lucky with snake and reckless with bear
i have have some close call with lionfish
it figure that the thing to finally nail me would be live on my_own front porch
the black_widow 's graceful form and red hourglass mark have make it america_'s most recognizable spider
the eastern specie latrodectus mactans be common from florida to new_york and as far west as texas
but despite their fearsome reputation black_widow be surprisingly shy and retire
over the course of your life you have probably walk past hundred_of black_widow without even realize it
each one pack enough venom to lay out a heavyweight boxer for day yet globally only a few people each year be kill by widow bite
widow web be easy to identify messy and close to the ground
i spot the first one knit against the step of my front porch in albemarle county va.
a little black ballerina be balance in the back of it
i regret kill her but she be too close to an area_where my child play
i blast her with wasp spray and she drop out of her web
i hunt for more to photograph and eliminate
the perimeter of my house turn_out to harbor a village of black_widow web
i rack up as many as a dozen little black and red trophy a day
fascinate by our proximity i seek to learn more about these deadly neighbor
the black_widow be unfairly name
female spider rarely kill the male after mating and possibly only in captivity
the male look very_different from the mature female he be small and brownish
the hourglass marking be quite variable in both sex
both sex carry the same venom but the female have more of it and their fang can inject it deep
one winter day i carry inside a basket my child have leave on the front lawn
i notice a withered looking black_widow cling to its side still alive but stiff and slow with the cold
i drop her into a mason jar and for three_month she live on my desk on a diet of moth
i learn a_lot about black_widow just by observe her
they be awkward outside their web
they be poor climber compare_with other spider unable_to scale the side of a jar
i be surprised that my pet widow never use her venom first
when confront by prey that be too large or aggressive she back off rather_than bite
one warm spring afternoon i decide to go fishing for dinner
on the same front porch where i have remove so_many black_widow i keep a pair of water shoe and some fishing tackle
i put the shoe and the tackle in my car and drive eight mile to my favor hole
i don the shoe before walk to the edge of the water
within about a dozen step i_feel a stinging sensation on the second toe of my left_foot as if there have be a thorn inside the shoe
then the pain increase to about that of a wasp 's sting
i sit on a rock and remove the shoe
the squash remains of a spider be smear across the insole
i_realize instantly what must have happen a black_widow from the porch have make its home in my shoe
for a long moment i star at my throbbing toe and wonder_what to do
some people be more affect by the venom than others
most healthy adult experience a_lot of pain and recover on their_own
but others become incapacitated and some die
which group would i fall into
or have i be bite by something else entirely
why make a big deal out of nothing
i decide to wait and find out before get behind the wheel
i dip my foot into the cool water and decide i may as_well pass the time by fishing 1_2 next_page
jackson landers a nature writer be the author of eat alien one man 's adventures hunting invasive animal species
a friend of mine never understand_why his neighbor spend a_lot of money on thing he do_not care about like house and car
to him these_thing be not worth the money
so one time when he be be particularly grumpy about it i ask_him about his_family 's spending habit
i have notice that compare_with most family i know his_family appear to spend a_lot of money on vacation and even more on recreational gear
my_friend be a smart guy take only a moment to see the disconnect
both my_friend and his neighbor have make a decision that it be worth it to them to spend_more on thing and experience that they really value
it_' not unusual to spend_more money on the thing that really matter to us
we probably all have something we refuse_to substitute for a cheap option
however when we do spend_more without build a framework for make these decision it_' the kind_of behavior that can blow_up budget and lead us to spend_more on thing that be not worth the extra money
here be a few thing to keep in mind 1
it make_sense to spend_more if we_want something to last longer
a few_year ago i have my eye on a new road bike
the bike i_want be not cheap and i debate buy a less expensive option
but when i start weigh the purchase in term of want_to ride the bike for year the more expensive better build bike make more sense
i still have and love the bike
time matter when we_'re debate spend_more
when we anticipate use something over a long period of time it_' important to compare the cost of replace a cheap version two or three time
if the cost be comparable the more expensive option could be the better choice
2
it make_sense to spend_more if we_want rare specific experience
i imagine more_than a few of you roll your_eye when i share my love of expensive ice_cream
part_of the reason i enjoy it so_much be the anticipation
i do_not eat it often only once every few_week
however the pleasure i get from anticipate that next pint be almost worth the price alone
i would not feel the same_way if it be not a rare experience
so when you_want to spend_more on something specific remember to consider the value of anticipation and how often you plan on do it
the rare the event the great the anticipation and research show that anticipate a future event like a vacation can match or even beat the happiness of the event itself
it_' the rare two for one deal that make it worth spend_more if we have make the smart decision to save and plan for it
3
it do_not make_sense to spend_more if it_' not a priority
sometimes the generic be just as good as the brand
unlike my ice_cream i rarely opt for the most expensive laundry soap
now some of you may be really particular about your laundry soap
the point be when we spend_more we_need to consider both reason 1 and 2 and if it_' a purchase that actually matter to us
if the option be interchangeable then go for a less expensive choice
do_not get in the habit of spend_more for the sake of spend_more
4
it do_not make_sense to spend_more if it_' about compete_with people
my_friend do_not care about his neighbor car and house
for him spend_more on vacation and gear he really want be what matter
so do_not forget the phrase keep up with the joneses when decide what something be really worth
commit to spend_more only on the thing and experience that matter personally
it do_not matter what our neighbor or friend want
focus_on what matter to you and your family and ignore what everyone_else be do
spend a_lot of money on something even something we would consider a luxury do_not mean we_'re make a bad money decision
it may even be the best decision
but to reach the point of know it_' a good decision we_need to be really aware of why we_want to spend_more and do our best to align the decision with our value
the more we can make money decision that support our value the less_likely we be to regret those decision even_if they_'re expensive choice
keep that thought in mind the next time you wonder_if it_' really worth it to spend_more
brace yourself sometimes the answer will be yes
madrid spain be on track to meet the 2013 budget deficit target it agree on with its european_union partner and should emerge_from recession before the end of the year the economy minister say on_monday
the minister luis de_guindos also say the government would not require additional one time austerity measure as part_of the 2014 budget that it will present this_month
the budget will be base_on an improve forecast for 2014 both in term of overall growth and unemployment which hit a record 27 percent earlier_this year mr._de guindos say

mr._de guindos would not say what the improved 2014 forecast would be
and while unemployment be expect to continue fall he warn_that spain still face significant challenge in term of create job and revive consumer spending
we believe the economy of spain be leave_behind the recession but not by any mean the crisis he say

from the economic perspective mr._de guindos say monday that a secessionist plan by a spanish region be a lose lose situation for the region and for the country

they have even forsake flower box for two conical tree at the top of the stoop
the bone of the house however be untouched and since the house have be sell only three time since it be complete in 1896 a rare trove of original detail be still intact

i be think of flower be not just a pretty face
they produce oxygen and keep us alive say the designer backstage
sex education at school give_me a diagram of the sexual reproduction of a flower
the anatomy of a woman be so similar to a flower when you dissect it
so the photo synthesis be graphic flower evolve_into this beautiful sensual shine
the most beautiful part_of the collection be to see mr. kane just 31 break into full bloom
everything have change the venue no_longer the hyper modern financial district high rise but a shamble brick warehouse
the pert girly style of his former collection have burst into ripe femininity
every detail seem perfectly select from shoe slightly 1930 with their fold back flap or the crocodile clip close a shoulder strap or hold up a swathe of skirt
out of all this the clothes give or take a flare of metallic glitter or the cut out piece have a normality and beauty that make them at once original but wearable

i_want it very soft and tender and joyous
i_love the idea of all_these little english rose the designer say
the color be very powdery
i use a_lot of english lace from nottingham and scottish cashmere
it_' a very british collection
that be true for the soft cardigan take_over from jacket in the show and the sweet country garden color that go from greenery to strawberry
yet apart_from the plastic shoulder cape give to the hot model cara delevingne at the finale there be precious little of the burberry raincoat that would have be so useful in the sunshine and shower september day
instead there be coat tailor plain sweetly colored with a touch of celine 's minimalism and a city rather_than a country charm
they be wear over the top and skirt often transparent in crunchy lace
mr. bailey have a way of create link to his other collection the visible lace underpants or a sudden flurry of polka dot pattern
but this show without a hard edge have a sweet serenity
the erdem collection seem to have the sweetness of marriage in mind give or take the clumpy shoe that be presumably design to grind the intricate lace and light chiffon all in black and white

london only a select few have ever_hear of bellville_sassoon
it be not that the british couture house do_not have its fan for more_than five decade bellville_sassoon 's gown grace palace society ball and the red_carpet
but the designer belinda bellville and david sassoon do_not like to talk_about their work
the couture house 's typically british stiff upper lip have be loosen for a new exhibition
the glamour of bellville_sassoon to open sept._20 at the fashion and textile museum in london
it will run_through jan. 11
bellville_sassoon favor discretion over publicity which mean they have an amazing career that a_lot of people do_not really know about say dennis nothdruft the curator who plan the exhibit as part_of the museum 's 10th anniversary celebration
ms. bellville hire mr._sassoon after see his royal college of art graduate collection in 1958
belinda be a classic deb type and know all the great society lady of the day mr._sassoon say in an_interview at the exhibition site

the exhibition will display about 80 bespoke and ready to wear creation date 1959 to 2012 when mr._sassoon close his chelsea workshop
couture order dwindle toward the end so retirement sort_of happen to me and after 55 year i would earn my rest say mr._sassoon now 81
we have to virtually beg borrow and steal to get the dress for the exhibition he_add
so_many be one offs and it never occur to me to keep any for myself
the designer say the house have dress absolutely every female member of the british royal family you_can think of with the exception of the queen as_well as most of europe 's royal family a clutch of jordanian princess and several shaykhahs of qatar
glitzy but untitled client include catherine deneuve madonna and julie christie
i_love the early 70 best mr._sassoon say
it be my period the excess the high demand for couture and there be plenty_of fabulous ball
anecdotes trip off the couturier 's tongue
he describe a 1960 visit to buckingham palace to fit a bridesmaid gown for princess anne then 9 queen elizabeth 's great anxiety be whether the dress be washable
in 1967 he arrive_at kensington palace for an appointment with princess margaret a moody woman and find her hide in the basement whitewash the wall in a burgundy velvet yves saint laurent smoking suit with a polythene bag over it
audrey hepburn be so polite and effortless and liz taylor be late but very charming

q. why do lobster turn from dark blue green to red when boil
and why be they that dark color in the first place
a. a relatively simple explanation for the color change emerge in a study publish in 2002 heat change the shape of a protein call beta crustacyanin in the shell relax its bond with the pigment astaxanthin
the free pigment reflect wavelength of light in the red spectrum
but it turn_out that the heat relate shape change account for only about a third of the color difference accord_to a 2005 study by dutch researcher in the journal of the american chemical society
the new research point to a complex quantum physic interaction that would account for a much large shift and for the live lobster 's original color
when the red pigment be fully hide in the enclose protein it absorb all wavelength of light red as_well as blue and green so the lobster appear black
the previous research have find that the red pigment molecule be group in pair within the crustacyanin cross each_other in a tight x formation
the dutch researcher calculate that they interfere with one another cause shift in their quantum energy state thus alter the wavelength of light that be absorb
use nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to examine protein pigment interaction the researcher find that this effect be a large one suggest_that it be the primary source of lobster color.â â question@nytimes.com
brooklyn_bridge park have plenty go for it already the waterfront promenade the little corner where you escape into nature the playground and soccer field
but it could use more wide open green space place to picnic or throw a frisbee the kind_of free for all gathering spot synonymous with the exercise of democracy and the flirtation of sunbather
and another architectural landmark in the city never hurt
voilã a new plan which should win city approval shortly would give pier 6 off atlantic avenue a flowering meadow with seasonal grass a sprawling field and a triangular wooden viewing platform
that ' at the southern end of this spectacularly successful 1.3-mile long brooklyn park where there_' already a maze of child 's playground
the meadow and field would add breathing room to the pier and a mini great lawn float serenely over the east river
more to the point the proposal also envision a new work of public architecture whose distinctive shape its architect describe as a manta ray
a manta ray or maybe a humongous tostito in any case a triangular platform step and undulating do for brooklyn_bridge park sort_of what the boathouse do for central_park
create a visual anchor for that end of the park as_well as for the riverfront it would become a perch from which to look not just over the harbor but also back at brooklyn
the platform be by the danish whiz kid bjarke ingels who be angle to become the next big thing in architecture
his firm bjarke ingels group know as big have be grab headline and commission with design that seem tailor make for glossy magazine spread
among_them be the pyramidal torquing apartment complex with a courtyard nearly the size of a football field now under_construction on west 57th street at the hudson river
at 39 mr. ingels have his formal tic already but also a knack for turn architecture into landscape which in essence be the task here
the brief be to complete the ground devise for the undeveloped area of pier 6
michael van valkenburgh the brooklyn base landscape architect whose firm have oversee the design of the whole park have plan the meadow as a destination point for the walking path from atlantic avenue and the big lawn to work as a single grand space with the platform at the end of the pier
mr. ingels 's 6,000-square foot design which would command drop dead view of lower_manhattan have a baroque lilt with twist step fan out from the platform 's north side
where a corner of the platform coincide with the north corner of the pier the platform would be raise 17 foot on stilt to produce an effect resemble the prow of a ship
the architect call this the work 's â titanic moment he mean the movie not the wreck the point to which one or two people could climb and stand at the railing gaze out over the city
in essence the architecture invite us all to come to a spot where we can feel alone
the design 's wave allude to the water and echo the soft curve of mr._van valkenburgh 's hill and path
at night when light go on along the step and within the bench below the platform would become a giant outdoor dan flavin sculpture
should audience congregate for concert it could be a stage or seat for 300 people
the structure would cost_$ 8 million all to be raise privately
brooklyn_bridge park exemplify the sort_of public private venture the bloomberg_administration have champion with public space the priority but dependent on private money
city authorities just choose midtown equity a brooklyn developer to convert the historic empire stores the waterfront warehouse north of the bridge that belong_to brooklyn_bridge park
the store will be turn_into office and retail space with restaurant and the brooklyn historical society on the ground floor
in turn the project will throw off cash to operate the park
it_' a deal similar to the one for the hotel and residential complex now under_construction on pier 1 which the new_york architect jonathan marvel have conceive for the developer toll brothers and starwood
mr. marvel 's design defer to the park
the park should enhance the complex
i use to live on atlantic avenue above the damascus bakery and remember the grim walk west toward the waterfront
that be a trip to nowhere
now even on a midweek morning pier 6 be buzz with child young parent bikers and volleyball player
since the park open in_2010 it have transform the entire neighborhood
the diversity of the people_who use it prove that it serve the whole borough
mr. ingels 's platform would add to it as an elegant slab of contoured wood light than concrete allow its support column to remain thin
for the space underneath the platform would provide a seamless billow roof allow for dozen of people to find some shade and relax at waterside cafe table
it_' only a pity that the require wheelchair ramp and its railing along the structure 's edge mean that the platform feel partly disconnected from the lawn
the plan now await the public design commission 's go ahead and a patron for mr. ingels 's project
brooklyn and the city deserve both
archer fla. the rumble of a distant lawn mower the whoosh of a passing motorist and the buzz of a pesky fly hang in the air at bronson speedway
the rural quiet of a warm saturday allow ann young the owner of the small_town racetrack here to listen_to her doubt
maybe she have make the wrong decision when she buy the speedway in_2011
maybe run a short track on the weekend about 1,100 mile from her family and her home in new_york be not worth the effort
bronson speedway sit on 36 grassy acre just outside the florida town for which it be name
bronson population 1,100
the wood plank grandstand do_not quite reach the top of the sabal palm that brush up against the scoring tower
a black and white checkered sidewalk lead to a white wood panel concession stand with three red frame window
a collectible store stand a few foot away but there be no souvenir inside and the door appear to be paint shut
i just feel_like there_' a reason why i need to be here young say
i do_not really know_what it be yet
the idea to buy the track start almost as a joke when young and her_husband chris 60 be discuss a retirement project at their home in calverton n.y. in_2010
ann young 55 have be a register nurse for 34 year work her way up from a nursing school in brooklyn to run the operating room at brookhaven memorial hospital medical_center in patchogue n.y.
but her family 's passion have always be auto racing
young have be go to racetrack since she be 5
chris race car for more_than four_decade
and their son christopher 19 start race at 14
to humor her_husband ann young search online use the phrase racetrack for sale and the word bronson speedway appear in the result
know nothing about bronson fla. or how to run a racetrack she read on
a visit to bronson and month of negotiate land the youngs an abandon three eighth mile high bank asphalt oval track with a 6,000-square foot garage and two mobile home for $ 700,000 accord_to levy county property record
i buy a speedway they give_me the key and i go oh what do i do
now?'â she_say
ten day_after buy the track the youngs hold a meet and greet for area resident and driver
a group of them curious to meet the new owner turn up
we have a pretty_good opening day young say but it be downhill after that
more_than two_year later the racetrack have make no money
ann young have have to dip_into her family 's saving to make repair secure permit update license and sometimes pay the driver purse
some racetrack staff_member and volunteer have move on to other job or leave because of disagreement with management about personnel and rule change the detail of which they air on online discussion board
some of the misstep have be self inflict when a couple of car show for one sportsman class race young cut the purse in half anger the driver
it be a mistake i would never make again she admit add what that guy cost me on the internet be what i do_not pay on the purse
bring in fan have be young 's steep challenge but she be not alone
there be 1,396 register racetrack in the united_states and canada accord_to the national speedway directory
the attendance drop off at small_town track have be attribute to more entertainment option televise race and high fuel price accord_to interview with more_than a dozen racetrack owner and promoter
but what have stay the same at these small track be the personal connection that owner driver and staff_member have to the sport
small_town racing run deep than money
it be often tie to family
a_lot of people_who be buy the racetrack they typically have some type_of involvement in the industry say tim frost the publisher of the national speedway directory
they race as a kid or they have a parent involve in the industry

long before he bring people into his laboratory at_columbia university to smoke crack cocaine carl hart saw its effect firsthand
grow_up in poverty he watch relative become crack addict live in squalor and steal from their mother
childhood friend end_up in prison and morgue
those addict seem enslave by crack like the laboratory rat that could_not stop press the lever for cocaine even as they be starve to death
the cocaine be provide such powerful dopamine stimulation to the brain 's reward center that the addict could_not resist take another hit
at_least that be how it look to dr._hart when he start his research career in the 1990
like other scientist he hop to find a neurological cure to addiction some mechanism for block that dopamine activity in the brain so that people would not succumb to the otherwise irresistible craving for cocaine heroin and other powerfully addictive drug
but then when he begin study addict he saw that drug be not so irresistible after all
eighty to 90_percent of people_who use crack and methamphetamine do_not get addicted say dr._hart an associate professor of psychology
and the small number who do become addicted be nothing like the popular caricature
dr._hart recruit addict by advertising in the village voice offer them a chance to make $ 950 while smoke crack make from pharmaceutical grade cocaine
most of the respondent like the addict he know grow_up in miami be black man from low_income neighborhood
to participate they have to live in a hospital ward for several week during the experiment
at the start of each day as researcher watch behind a one way mirror a nurse would place a certain amount_of crack in a pipe the dose vary daily and light it
while smoking the participant be blindfold so he could_not see the size of that day 's dose
then after that sample of crack to start the day each participant would be offer more opportunity during the day to smoke the same dose of crack
but each time the offer be make the participant could also opt for a different reward that they could collect when they eventually leave the hospital
sometimes the reward be $_5 in cash and sometimes it be a $_5 voucher for merchandise at a store
when the dose of crack be fairly high the subject would typically choose to keep smoke crack during the day
but when the dose be small he be more_likely to pass it up for the $_5 in cash or voucher
they do_not fit the caricature of the drug addict who can_not stop once he get a taste dr._hart say
when they be give an alternative to crack they make rational economic decision
when methamphetamine replace crack as the great drug scourge in the united_states dr._hart bring meth addict into his laboratory for similar experiment and the result show similarly rational decision
he also find that when he raise the alternative reward to $_20 every single addict of meth and crack alike choose the cash
they know they would not receive it until the experiment end week later but they be still willing_to pass up an immediate high
these finding make dr._hart rethink what he would see grow_up as he relate in his new book high price
it_' a fascinating combination of memoir and social science wrench scene of deprivation and violence accompany_by calm analysis of historical data and laboratory result
he tell horrifying story his_mother attack with a hammer his_father douse with a potful of boil syrup but then he look for the statistically significant trend
yes he note some child be abandon by crack addict parent but many family in his neighborhood be tear apart before crack include his_own
he be raise largely by his grandmother
yes his cousin become destitute crack addict live in a shed but they would drop out of school and have be unemployed long before crack come along
there seem to be at_least as many if not more case in which illicit drug play little or no role than be there situation in which their pharmacological effect seem to matter write dr._hart now 46
crack and meth may be especially troublesome in some poor neighborhood and rural area but not because the drug themselves be so potent 1_2 next_page

although the report have not be make public and be not make available to the new_york times two other recent report touch on similar problem though they do_not focus as closely on the issue of sexual_assault and harassment
ghulam mujtaba patang who step_down as interior minister in_august describe the united_nations report 's broad outline but question its finding
he say that after read the report he send a team to investigate the situation of female_police officer and that none of the woman his team speak to complain of such mistreatment
if an afghan policewoman be be rap or sexually harass they would report that they would not keep it secret he say
the chief spokesman_for the interior ministry seddiq seddiqi say he think the report have some exaggeration of the issue and the problem
both man insist however that the ministry be commit to improve the situation of policewoman
the report accord_to two people familiar with it survey nearly 10_percent of the female_police force
united_nations official would not discuss its detail
we be work with the ministry on follow up to the report and to put in place improvement say georgette gagnon the united_nations director of human_right for afghanistan
few subject be as taboo in afghanistan as sexual behavior and female victim of sexual attack be often accuse of immorality shun and sometimes jail
woman 's right advocate say that because afghan policewoman be afraid of be penalize for reveal the problem it be extremely difficult to get them to talk_about abuse
that be all the more true if the person commit the sexual_abuse be their commander or one of his close_friend on the police force
the policewoman interview by the times say they fear be fire or demote or be send to work in a job that be far_away from their home if_they complain
most policewoman be low_level security screener at checkpoint or government building and in many instance they be the only person earn money in the family and desperately need their salary usually around $ 240 per month
a further disincentive to talk publicly about sexual_abuse or coercion be that many afghans already believe female_police officer have loose moral simply because_they be willing_to work in public with man_who be not relative
if a woman admit that she be under pressure to have sex conservative relative may force her to quit or even kill her to expiate the perceive dishonor to the family
general patang say he have visit policewoman in all of the province and have never hear a complaint_about sexual_abuse
most mention discontent with salary or a lack of promotion he say
i_think the reason they tell these_thing to the u.n. and do_not mention it to my inquiry be that these be mainly illiterate woman who think they may gain more attention and support by make these claim he say
the situation for female_police officer be make more_difficult because there be so few of them barely 1 percent of the roughly 155,000-member force 1_2 next_page
from biology class to c.s.i. we be tell again and again that our genome be at the heart of our identity
read the sequence in the chromosome of a single cell and learn everything about a person 's genetic information or as 23andme a prominent genetic testing company say on its web_site
the more you_know about your dna the more you_know about yourself
but scientist be discover that to a surprising degree we contain genetic multitude
not long_ago researcher have think it be rare for the cell in a single healthy person to differ genetically in a significant way
but scientist be find that it_' quite common for an individual to have multiple genome
some people for_example have group of cell with mutation that be not find in the rest of the body
some have genome that come from other people
there have be whisper in the matrix about this for year even decade but only in a very hypothetical sense say alexander urban a geneticist at stanford university
even three_year ago suggest_that there be widespread genetic variation in a single body would have be meet with skepticism he say
you would have just run against the wall
but a series of recent paper by dr. urban and others have demonstrate that those whisper be not just hypothetical
the variation in the genome find in a single person be too large to be ignore
we now know it_' there dr. urban say
now we_'re map this new continent
dr. james r. lupski a lead expert on the human genome at baylor college of medicine write in a recent review in the journal science that the existence of multiple genome in an individual could have a tremendous impact on the practice of medicine
it_' change the way i_think he say in an_interview
scientist be find link from multiple genome to certain rare disease and now they_'re begin to investigate genetic variation to shed light on more common disorder
science 's change view be also raise_question about how forensic scientist should use dna evidence to identify people
it_' also pose challenge for genetic counselor who can_not assume that the genetic information from one cell can tell them about the dna throughout a person 's body
human blueprint
when an egg and sperm combine their dna the genome they produce contain all the necessary information for build a new human
as the egg divide to form an embryo it produce new copy of that original genome
for decade geneticist have explore how an embryo can use the instruction in a single genome to develop muscle nerve and the many other part_of the human body
they also use sequencing to understand genetic variation that can raise the risk of certain disease
genetic counselor can look_at the result of genetic screening to help patient and their family cope with these disease alter their diet for_example if_they lack a gene for a crucial enzyme
the cost of sequence an entire genome have fall so drastically in the past 20_year now a few thousand dollar down from an_estimate $ 3 billion for the public private partnership that sequence the first human genome that doctor be begin to sequence the entire genome of some patient
sequence can be do in as little as 50 hour
and they_'re identify link between mutation and disease that have never be see before
yet all_these powerful test be base_on the assumption that inside our body a genome be a genome be a genome
scientist believe_that they could look_at the genome from cell take in a cheek swab and be_able to learn about the genome of cell in the brain or the liver or anywhere else in the body
in the mid-1900 scientist begin to get clue that this be not always true
in 1953 for_example a british woman donate a pint of blood
it turn_out that some of her blood be type o and some be type a.
the scientist who study her conclude_that she have acquire some of her blood from her twin brother in the womb include his genome in his blood cell
chimerism as such condition come to be know seem for many year to be a rarity
but it can be common than we realize say dr. linda randolph a pediatrician at children_'s hospital in los_angeles who be an author of a review of chimerism publish in the american journal of medical genetics in_july
twin can end_up with a mixed supply of blood when they get nutrient in the womb through the same set of blood vessel
in other case two fertilize egg may fuse together
these so_call embryonic chimera may go_through life blissfully unaware of their origin
one woman discover she be a chimera as late as age 52
in need of a kidney transplant she be test so that she may find a match
the result indicate_that she be not the mother of two of her three biological child
it turn_out that she have originate from two genome
one genome give rise to her blood and some of her egg other egg carry a separate genome
woman can also gain genome from their child
after a baby be bear it may leave some fetal cell behind in its mother 's body where they can travel to different organ and be absorb into those tissue
it_' pretty likely that any woman who have be pregnant be a chimera dr. randolph say

lake forest ill. when he tie a pga_tour record by shoot a 59 on_friday jim furyk have difficulty explain_how he have manage such a feat catch among luck skill and sheer happenstance
after he let his late final_round lead slip away at the bmw_championship at conway farms on_monday there be no mystery
from tee to green it be plenty good enough furyk say
but from holes 6 through 18 i just do_not putt well enough
a downpour wipe_out most of sunday 's scheduled final_round and furyk begin monday with a one stroke lead
after a birdie on the 10th hole he have a two shot lead at 15 under_par
but zach johnson shoot a six under 65 and birdie three of the last seven hole to finish 16 under his furious comeback snatch victory from furyk who shoot a 71 and finish 13 under
nick watney be second after a seven under 64 that leave him 14 under
a phenomenal day johnson say
one of the best final_round i probably have come_up with in a while especially come down the stretch
for furyk it be an all too familiar scene as he be unable_to deliver crucial putt with victory within his grasp
it have be three_year since he win the tour_championship
he have flirt with the top of the leader board since but he have not win a tournament
monday make it the sixth consecutive time he fail to convert at_least a share of the lead after 54 hole into a win
furyk lose the lead to johnson on the 13th hole when his 5-foot par putt lip out
on the 16th hole johnson nail an 18-foot birdie putt from just off the green
he pump his fist as the ball roll into the cup
furyk bogey the 16th his third bogey of the back nine and johnson birdie the 17th
the wrong way to ever think_about a lead be hold on furyk say
i_feel like the idea today be to go out be aggressive and hit the ball at the pin try_to shoot four or five under and make the rest of the field chase me
i just be not able_to do it
furyk though will be part_of next_week 's tour_championship field in atlanta which will feature the top 30 golfer in the fedex_cup standing
the winner of the cup win a $_10 million prize
watney 's strong finish earn him a spot after he enter the weekend rank 34th and johnson 's win ensure him the cup championship with another victory next_week
the big mover be luke donald a graduate of nearby northwestern university and a member of conway farms
donald shoot a 66 and finish 11 under
he begin the day 54th in the standing but after five birdie in his last seven hole he squeak into the top 30 at no

westwood be one of several prominent player who will not compete for the fedex_cup include rory mcilroy who enter the season rank no 1 in the world
other notable absence be bubba watson and rickie fowler
the suburb in this area have provide furyk some of his great triumph and bad defeat
he win his only major the 2003 united_states open at olympia fields about 60 mile_away and the 2005 western open at nearby cog hill
but he also bogey the final two hole at medinah last_year to lose a duel with sergio garcã­a on the final day of the ryder cup
the loss help europe stage a comeback to beat the united_states
after another difficult finish furyk seem content to take the good with the bad

the premise of this tiresome new novel by the critically acclaimed author norman rush sound as if it have be lift straight from the big chill a group of now middle aged college friend reunite to commemorate the death of one of their_own
the result not only lack that movie 's humor and groovy soundtrack but be also an eye rollingly awful read
the novel 's preening self absorb character natter on endlessly about themselves in exchange that sound more like outtake from a dolorous group therapy session than like real conversation among longtime friend
its title subtle body which refer_to people 's true interior self whatever that mean be a perfect predictor of the novel 's solipsistic tone
reader give to write comment in their book be likely_to find_themselves repeatedly scrawl word like narcissistic ridiculous irritate and pretentious in the margin
there have always be a strain of self consciousness in mr. rush 's writing but in his earlier book set in botswana where mr. rush once work in the peace corps the african setting provide him with an opportunity brilliantly seize in his debut collection of story white to exercise his reportorial eye and to place his character personal dilemma within the large context of westerners try_to come to term with africa and its colonial past
with each book since whites that be the national book award_win mating from 1991 and mortal 2003 his narrative and character have grow more inner direct a process that have reach its cloying culmination in subtle body
although most of this novel be set on an estate in the catskills shortly before the 2003 invasion of iraq it actually take_place largely inside the head of a political activist name ned and his possessive wife nina who both it quickly become apparent live within the mylar bubble of their marriage obsessively dissect each_other 's emotion and mood
ned think of nina as his honey monkey
nina think of ned as a sort_of jesus a secular jesus
when ned and nina both wear jean she think of them as a symphony in denim
ned have rush from california to the catskills where his friend douglas have just die and nina have follow in hot pursuit because she ' ovulate now and want_to have a child she ' furious that he ' pick this moment to get on an airplane without her
back in the 1970 we learn ned be part_of a clique at new_york university a band of student who as nina understand it think of themselves as a group of wit superior sensibility of some kind
they be the sort_of folk who refer_to themselves as cineastes because_they go to movie at the thalia
they like to use word like outre refer_to graffiti artist as ulterior decorator and say that pinot noir mean do_not urinate at night
when they listen_to record no_one be allow to speak
douglas who seem to have drive a lawn mower too close to the edge of a ravine be the leader of the pack
reminiscent of the charismatic genius figure in iris murdoch novel he be an intellectual guru for the others though it_' baffle why anyone would look up to such a pompous jerk
douglas pick_up his college girlfriend claire with the line
i stand here lonely as a turnstile and find it amusing to insert the word egad into every answer he give in a class
one of the group remember that douglas wish if we all outlive him we would go to some park and hide in the tree and when somebody come by we would shout great pan be dead.'â this jokester attitude infect douglas 's child rearing as_well
he name his son hume after the philosopher david hume and encourage him to be as outrageous as possible
hume have grow_up to be a feral teenager with a double mohawk haircut he often live off by himself in the wood in a cabin or a yurt
the medium be arrive to cover the memorial service for douglas because he be half famous in the world for debunk forgery he 'd prove that some sensational paper reveal that alfred dreyfus be in fact guilty of espionage be right_wing forgery and have shoot_down forgery of milan kundera 's so_call love diaries.'â there_' a_lot of mumbo jumbo about douglas 's philosophy it_' say that he be propose various universal solution to the problem of the persistence of evil in the world in human relation and more portentous gibberish about his current mysterious work nina say she ' learn that he take something call special commission
which mean that he do work for the german bundes something and for the israelis
the other member of this novel 's cast be either as insufferable as douglas or as flimsy as paper doll mannequin
there_' elliot an officious stockbroker who make risky and risky bet in the market and seem to have lose a_lot of his friend money
there_' gruen a chubby fellow who own an agency that make public_service announcement for tv and who use to serve_as everybody 's confessor
and there_' joris who go to prostitute for sex because he regard himself as a married woman fetishist who would ruin any marriage he undertake the same_way he ruin his first one he rarely see his two son from that union and say that maritime law be a perfect field for him because absolute cynicism be the best weltanschauung to have if_you be in it because the field be strew with pirate and crook
perhaps mr. rush mean all this to read as black comedy but it_' not remotely funny or compelling
in fact it_' impossible to work up any interest in hear what these absurdly self important and poorly draw character may have to say as they drone on about themselves with some random aside about islam dadaism anti semitism and abstract matter like the sublime of deeply comprehend the world
at one point ned say to nina why be we even talk_about this
it_' a question the reader may well ask about this claustrophobic and totally annoying novel
to the editor_re learning what work sept. 3 while bring more student to stem field be important it can_not and should not be the major goal
all student benefit_from learn science especially science as process rather_than rote memorization
understand and employ the critical thinking skill involve in the scientific method can help inform anyone 's life
furthermore we be all consumer of science
we use medicine we vote for legislator who decide which scientific endeavor get government funding
we face issue like climate_change antibiotic resistance and genetically modify organism
do_not all of us deserve to really understand_what we be debate
jennifer zinman glen ridge n.j. to the editor i heartily agree with salman khan 's desire to position creativity and invention as the focus of stem course
to begin to address how we can do this there be several critical success factor to consider
the most_important of these be failure since it be critical to figure thing out about the natural world or to create a new design
repeatedly reiterate the process use while make small change approach the problem from multiple perspective or work backwards from the desire outcome these be example of strategy that we use in a wide variety of context include stem exploration
our assessment of student need to reward thoughtful detour and dead end if we_want to encourage a culture of creativity and innovation in stem classroom

with 57 case in a decade it be far below the hardest hit country congo with 10,581 and madagascar with 7,182
still it be the only wealthy country on the list 97 percent of case be in africa
the survey be publish monday by the american journal of tropical medicine and hygiene
the black death kill a third of europe in the 14th century but case be no_longer find there probably because city keep rat population down say the author dr. thomas c. butler a plague expert at ross university medical_school in the west indies
by_contrast in the american southwest the bacteria have shift into rural squirrel and prairie dog
most case come from flea bite but in the united_states a national_park biologist die after inhale the bacteria while do a necropsy of a mountain lion and a 60-year old geneticist in chicago die apparently after be careless with a research strain he believe be safe
the big outbreak be among gold and diamond miner in congo
outbreaks be also trace to infected camel meat one animal in afghanistan infect 83 people

parisian official recently publish a manual for the service industry that offer transliterate mandarin phrase and cultural tip for better understand chinese desire include this tidbit they be very picky about gastronomy and wine
to judge from the grumbling across the globe such guideline may be necessary

mgmt mgmt columbia
something '_always loom and buzz or burbling or clattering or tap or ratchet or blipping or quavering near the foreground throughout mgmt 's third album mgmt. it make the album both testing and eventually reward
andrew vanwyngarden and ben goldwasser who write and record as mgmt have embrace excess since mgmt 's 2007 debut_album oracular spectacular
their lyric be ornately elusive their arrangement deploy a neo psychedelic profusion of instrument and many of their song pack in multiple episode
mgmt trim back those tendency enough to start their major label career with three single from oracular spectacular that push forward drumbeat and keyboard hook to hint at 1970 pop in time to pretend
electric feel and the two million sell kid
but mgmt 's second album congratulation in_2010 spurn pop mechanic reach back to the most baroque confection of 1960 pop yield no hit
behind the disco ball gleam of oracular spectacular be a fascination with youthful bravado and disillusionment the labyrinthine song of congratulation grapple and quarrel with commercial success
on mgmt mr. vanwyngarden and mr. goldwasser have even large ambition
they ponder purpose fate and mortality in song like mystery disease your life be a lie and i_love you too death
the album 's keynote be borrow introspection a folk rock song from a 1968 album by a long_island songwriter who call himself faine jade
it vow there_' a reason and i will someday find the plan
mgmt be less optimistic their song see grow malaise and the inevitability of loss and deterioration
which explain the sound
there_' still a late-1960s foundation to most song while mgmt make few digression from verse chorus bridge than on congratulation
but the music have turn less antiquarian
with the producer dave fridmann mgmt have pile on layer and loop of percussion electronics and effect an almost overwhelming welter of activity a meticulous clamor that well up and change throughout every track

off the beaten path be his third strong album each of which engage_in a bait and switch cloak old school value with new school reference
he be in no way a dissenter merely someone_who understand that old form can stand even strong with injection of new idea
without the vintage quaver in mr. moore 's voice
it_' heavy on
for some ol redneck reason or the thickness of the guitar in his arrangement these song would have other meaning
but mr. moore be solid in his conviction that country music of the 1970 the more accessible side of the outlaw year be worth preserve and that the true modern spirit of that sound be mindful of the rest of the world
he ' also capable of nonideological beauty old habits a duet with miranda lambert with echo of george jones and tammy wynette or

focus have never seem_like a problem for the alto and soprano saxophonist kenny garrett who at 52 still possess the taut molten sound that make him a force nearly 30 year_ago

judge by the clarity and intensity of the result mr. garrett have to do a_lot of push
his choose path as a bandleader build on the mid-'60 terrain of the john coltrane quartet flagrantly ingeniously and there_' a typical amount_of slash polyrhythm and modal expedition here
that may be a problem if mr. garrett 's current band with the pianist vernell brown the bassist corcoran holt the drummer mcclenty hunter and the percussionist rudy bird do_not do this sort_of thing imposingly well
so too do the colleague who sub in for part_of the album like the pianist benito gonzalez and the drummer marcus baylor
as a composer mr. garrett be often quick to show his hand
hey chick be his nod to chick corea a longtime collaborator the next track be chucho 's mambo a tribute to the pianist chucho valdes
there_' also a springy calypso j'ouvert homage to sonny rollins and a churchly ballad with string brother brown for the pianist donald brown who help produce the album

the road to japan 's energy future run_through a cluster of low building in this city the large on the northern island of hokkaido
here work on their_own and in collaboration_with american scientist researcher be study sediment core contain methane hydrate icy construct of water molecule with the explosive ga methane trap within
hydrate contain sediment be find in large amount around the world both under the sea and to a less extent in permafrost
if_they can be tap safely and economically they could be an abundant source of fuel especially for country like japan that have few energy reserve of their_own
the japanese researcher work have_already bear fruit in march the government announce that it have successfully produce methane from hydrate in sediment under the pacific ocean
the effort conduct from a drilling ship in the nankai trough about 100 mile east of osaka be the world 's first hydrate production test in deep water
but scientist say there be still much that be unknown about the unusual compound sometimes refer_to as flammable ice and that the commercial production of ga from them be still far off
we_need to know more about the physical property of hydrate themselves and of the sediment as_well say hideo narita the director of the research laboratory part_of the national_institute of advanced industrial science and technology which be finance largely by the government
further research here and at lab around the world will help scientist better understand the environmental impact of hydrate production include the possible release of methane a potent greenhouse_ga into the sea or atmosphere
there be also the potential for subsea landforms to become unstable when hydrate be remove
timothy s. collett a research geologist with the united_states geological survey say that despite all the talk_about their potential as an energy resource hydrate be largely still a scientific issue
the research pose special challenge because hydrate form under high pressure cause_by the weight of all the seawater or rock above them and that pressure must be maintain when the sediment core be analyze
if it be not the hydrate within quickly dissociate into water and ga and the sediment look_like chocolate mousse say carlos santamarina a professor_at georgia tech

i've be involve in the television industry for 30 year and i have have to travel almost all of that time
in my last job i travel about 45 week out of the year and be sometimes go for three or four day
i_think there be three phase to business travel
during the first phase you love it
i would get excited about every trip even_if it be to some small city that be not all that glamorous
in the next phase you hate it
i be in this phase for quite a while
i be tired of the hassle of flying sleep in hotel and be away_from home
in the third phase you realize you_can not win so you just tolerate it
that ' where i be at right_now
i be not go to make myself crazy if there_' a delay or cancellation but i be not love the whole idea of travel
most of my business trip involve go to convention and meet with everyone we do business with at cableready

year_ago i be come_back from a convention and almost all the passenger on the plane be involve in the television industry
it be a_lot of fun
a woman sit_next to me ask_if we all know each_other and i explain that a_lot of the passenger attend the same television convention that i do
she then tell_me she hat television and for three hour i have to listen_to exactly why she hat tv. i ask her what she do for a living and she tell_me she be a lawyer
i be too polite to have a conversation about why people may not like lawyer
i remember the very first_time i be upgrade
i be a senior at central michigan university and a friend and i be head to the national_association of broadcasters convention in las_vegas
we be on our way to the airport but our car could_not handle the snow
we finally get to the airport but our flight be cancel
i start talk to the airline clerk and tell her our tale of woe and she book us on the next flight out of detroit
we be even upgrade to first class
i_think it be awesome and when the attendant come by to take our drink order i be in awe
i reach for my wallet and the attendant tell_me quite firmly that first class passenger never pay for their drink
i_think that be the cool thing ever

do i actually just pay $ 55.58 for a simple omelet and coffee from room service at the anaheim hilton hotel in southern_california last_week
yes i do
it be very early my laptop be misbehave the clock be tick toward deadline i have not have dinner the night before
still that ' the first_time i have experience buyer 's remorse over an omelet though it arrive quickly and be actually pretty_good
any business trip have peak and valley so i_think i would pass along some example from my most_recent for a few_day at the annual airline passenger experience trade show in anaheim with an add stop in los_angeles
the airfare a cheap $ 231.80 round trip on american airlines between tucson and los_angeles be a peak
so be my avis rental car a complimentary upgrade to a sporty volvo xc60 that cost_$ 175.30 for a week include all those annoying tax and fee
but a valley also come with the car
the electronic dashboard interface the control for everything other than actually make the car go be baffling
as i drive i try_to figure_out unfathomable symbol and notice from brian 's iphone which for some reason flash on the dashboard screen whenever i try in vain to regulate the air conditioner to an elaborately design radio that resist my effort to change the channel
so the guy who pass me on the 105 tap his horn and wave to signal that my rear windshield wiper remain on even_though it be a sunny day should know that hip_hop music also be blast inside my car in maddening synchronization with the wiper that i could_not turn_off
once home incidentally i read that a j._d. power report in_june say one of the top complaint of new car owner this_year be incomprehensible high_tech dashboard control design
speak of top complaint the airport security hassle always rank high
again there be a peak and a valley on my trip
the peak be the tucson airport where the transportation security administration screener be invariably courteous and friendly
the valley be reach on my return flight at los_angeles international airport
thanks to my membership in global entry i have the covet precheck certification on my boarding pas for a fast pas through security
but as i stroll happily through the metal detector without have to remove my shoe or take out my laptop a glower t.s.a. screener block my advance and tell_me basically not so fast buster
i have be randomly select to be swab down for explosive
hold your palm out the screener bark at me as she tug on rubber glove
how about you say please
i reply
this displease her mightily but after pass the no bomb trace on palm test i be allow to proceed
i later tell david castelveter a spokesman_for the t.s.a. that while my encounter with screener be usually pleasant and professional this one bother me partly_because it have cloud my first experience with precheck
i can_not comment on the particular but the officer as part_of their training be teach how to properly interact_with customer
we hold them to a very high standard of customer interaction mr. castelveter say
the t.s.a. have other worry last_week to be sure
the night before i later read a former t.s.a. agent be arrest on charge of make unspecified threat against the airport in an eight page letter title the end of america the end of satan
that same agent accord_to the los_angeles times have earlier resign after report that he have humiliate a 15-year old girl at the airport in_june for what he call her inappropriate attire
peaks and valley
the night before my return home i have a peak stay at the four points by sheraton los_angeles airport a good midlevel hotel close by the airport where i have manage to score a nightly rate of $ 98.75 tax and fee include through the priceline name your_own price blind bidding service
when i get home i_realize that i have leave a single brown dress shoe behind in my room
i phone the hotel and speak with a friendly housekeeping manager juana ortiz who say i have your shoe and will send it to you
then alas i spend an hour online and on the phone with fedex try_to update the expired american express platinum card number on my account
my old card have be hack during a previous trip and i need my fedex account updated so that ms. ortiz could send the shoe
i do_not yet know whether that work because my fedex account wo_not let_me see my detail without approval from the administrator who happen to be me
as to the brown shoe that i stupidly forget one way or another i be confident_that ms. ortiz will get it back to me
which will be another peak

moscow american farmer be get an_unexpected windfall from a contentious fight between russia and belarus a former soviet splinter state
the subject of the fight be potash a fertilizer
the score so_far one imprison russian business executive the disintegration of a once effective cartel that keep world potash price high and political tension_between the two country
what be be call the fertilizer war be the late of numerous trade and economic spat between russia and belarus whose leader though preside_over similar autocratic political system do_not get along personally russian political_analyst say
aleksandr g. lukashenko president of belarus and vladimir_v. putin president of russia by most account detest each another
their feeling have spill over into the fertilizer business
the potash problem reach a peak on july 30 when uralkali the russian potash company announce it be withdraw_from an international cartel call the belarusian potash company or b.p.c. which be create to keep price high
two marketing group b.p.c. in the former soviet_union and canpotex in canada sell nearly all the potash in the world
b.p.c. market fertilizer for uralkali and belaruskali the belarussian company and canpotex for three canadian producer the potash corporation of saskatchewan mosaic and agrium
for year potash company have keep a thumb on the global trade of this critical plant nutrient choke back supply to raise price much as the organization of the petroleum exporting countries do with oil or de beers with diamond
the two cartel set nearly identical price for potash worldwide prevent farmer from benefit_from competition
uralkali say it be leave b.p.c. because the belarus president have be allow fertilizer sale on the side
it predict potash price would drop about 25_percent to $_300 a ton from around $ 400 a ton when it leave
the low price would hurt russia but they would hurt belarus more
though uralkali deny any direct link this action come after year of effort by mr._putin and the kremlin to compel belarus to sell strategic asset like oil refinery and natural_ga pipeline in exchange for subsidized energy supply
mr. lukashenko first agree to sell a stake in belaruskali though the potash mine provide about 10_percent of the state tax revenue but then balk
he say it be still for sale but cite an exorbitantly high price anger the russian oligarch who have be vie for it and set the stage for the breakup of the fertilizer cartel that follow
the belarussian government retaliate with what appear to be a trap the belarussian prime_minister invite the chief_executive of uralkali vladislav baumgertner to his country for talk on_aug. 26 and then arrest him at the airport
uralkali 's chairman aleksandr voloshin and a part owner suleyman kerimov have also be invite but only mr. baumgertner show up
it be unclear_whether the others stay clear of belarus because_they have sense a trap or whether their schedule simply do_not have room for the country_'s prime_minister which be the formal explanation both official offer
mr. baumgertner be charge with abuse of power which carry a potential 10-year sentence
belarus state television_show his glum perp walk past the water stain concrete wall of a prison nickname the american girl lead by a chubby guard in a camouflage uniform
belaruskali which be state own have no public_relation office
the switchboard refer call to anatoly v. makhlai whose title be deputy director for ideology and cadre who decline to comment
later the belarussian authorities issue arrest_warrant for four other executive and mr. kerimov the part owner
analyst_say mr. baumgertner be not likely_to serve hard time but be instead be hold as a hostage to compel the russians to rejoin the cartel
outraged the russians respond with a flurry of trade restriction ban all belarussian pork import ostensibly over newly discover health concern
it look_like the conflict be escalate boris krasnojenov a mining analyst at renaissance capital an investment bank base in moscow confirm in an_interview
farmer and fertilizer company be watch closely
share in the potash corporation of saskatchewan rise earlier_this week after sign of a reconciliation
report indicate mr. kerimov would sell his stake to another russian oligarch more palatable to president lukashenko or to the nickel mining company norilsk lead to a patch up of tie and re creation of the price fix cartel
but norilsk say on_wednesday that it have no plan to buy a stake
share in potash corporation fall again
even by the standard of business practice in the former soviet_union these tactic appear blunt
this move be absolutely aggressive and abnormal mr. krasnojenov say refer_to the arrest of mr. baumgertner
the prime_minister invite the c.e.o. of a major company to a meeting and then arrest him
the dispute have hurt profit of both uralkali and its former belarussian partner belaruskali and be wonderful for farmer from idaho to india who have_already benefit_from low fertilizer price
potash be one of three main plant nutrient along_with phosphate and nitrogen and be use widely to increase corn and soybean yield
the price for granular potash in the midwest have fall to around $ 400 a ton from $ 420 before the announcement on july 30
optimist say that every cloud have a silver lining ed lotterman a columnist for the idaho statesman write of the wobble cartel
it be not hard to find one in the recent potash industry upheaval that send the stock of several fertilizer producer down by a fourth
what be bad for them be great news for u.s. farmer
power chord and pizzicato
cha cha and chamber music
funk and free jazz
klezmer and cacophony
all of those and many more turn up during a marathon of john zorn 's masada work at the n.y.u. skirball center on_sunday
in four and a half_hour of music by 13 ensemble and soloist the concert celebrate mr._zorn 's 60th birthday which be sept. 2
he have be mark the occasion with concert around the world that have reaffirm his astonishing productivity and multifarious connection
mr._zorn be sample and mash up idiom long before computer make it easy he be also well before the internet set_up improbable but fruitful network of musician and idea
the concert draw on a fraction of mr._zorn 's masada repertory two set of melody the first 200 of them from the 1990s and another 316 tune he write in three_month in 2004
nearly all of the program come from the second group the book of angels
the masada piece be base in klezmer with its modal scale odd meter and zigzag melody
and like klezmer itself a fusion of what jewish musician bring with them and pick_up in travel through eastern europe and then america the tune be flexible
they be brittle perpetual motion jazz in uri caine 's piano solo blister psychedelic jam power by bass riff pluck on a moroccan gimbri in the hand of abraxas and sleek bachelor pad music as play by bar kokhba
krakauer set david krakauer 's clarinet wail over funk vamp
mycale a four woman a cappella group turn them into intricate ingenious glow pan mediterranean song
much of mr._zorn 's music revolve_around the idea of genre investigate how they_'re recognize how they connect or contrast how far they can be stretch how they can be juxtapose or intercut
he approach genre as a connoisseur a strategist a trickster and sometimes a vandal if a genre be see as a set of rule he may play by them toy with them or tear them apart
behind the musical element be the association of genre with era place and people his music pull free of them
erik friedlander turn masada tune into impassioned cello solo recall the technique of bach suite
malphas the duo of mark feldman on violin and sylvie courvoisier on piano play them as splinter chamber music a series of brief precise suddenly contrast passage last only a few second each
the roberto rodriguez octeto masada mingle klezmer with latin charanga and invite the audience to dance
the masada string trio give its tune a hint of gypsy music
dreamer cast the melody as smoothly shimmer jazz
cyro baptista 's banquet of the spirit charge into one melody as a kind_of middle_eastern surf rock and secret chiefs 3 crank its tune up to burly jazz rock with klezmer violin interlude
electric masada with mr._zorn on alto saxophone have the last set and it be a gleeful eventful one move amid hurtle electric jazz eerie laptop electronics and squall of percussion and dissonance cue on the spot by mr._zorn
and all through the marathon a paradox persist
with all the transformation and idiom the masada tune hold on to some klezmer identity one stubborn genre indeed
john zorn return on_sept. 28 with a daylong multi ensemble event at the metropolitan_museum of art

it seem obvious that a comedy about a mother and daughter team of recover addict would be harder edge than one about meddle elderly father who wo_not pick_up a check
actually mom which begin next monday on cbs be for some reason both witty and sweet than the new fox show dad which have its premiere on_tuesday
it_' not the casting although mom have a slight edge with allison janney as bonnie and anna faris as her_daughter christy
but still dad have its share of experienced comic actor include martin mull as the father of warner giovanni ribisi and peter riegert as the father of eli seth green
mostly it_' the sensibility behind the writing
chuck lorre a creator of mom be know among_other thing for two and a half men and the big bang theory
those hit comedy ostensibly revolve_around immature man but they be even more distinctive for their funny uncommon female character notably amy on big bang play by mayim bialik
dad have many executive_producer include seth macfarlane a creator of family guy
it turn_out that the willfully sophomoric politically incorrect humor that work in an animated series do_not sound as amusing when come_out of the mouth of flesh and blood actor
there be some funny line but not nearly enough
material that be mean to be anarchic mostly come across as obvious and boorish
mom be more genuinely provocative
bonnie be an irrepressibly cheery and unapologetic former addict who can_not understand_why her grow daughter be still so resentful
i_'ve watch you lick cocaine crumb out of a shag carpet christy say
bonnie reply primly it_' not a sin to be thrifty dear
it help that cable have_already lay the groundwork for the flawed mother figure
show like the sopranos and break_bad give rise to the era of so_call difficult man but cable have also radically loosen the restriction on heroine
homemaker be rule breaker from the suburban pot dealer on weeds to the substance abuse title character of nurse jackie
it use to be that sitcom character complain that their mom be crazy because she have too_many hat on the united_states of tara toni collette play a wife and mother with multiple personality
mom behave badly be not a new thing but on a prime_time show it still feel a little transgressive
man_who act like boy on the other_hand be so familiar that they_'re almost retro
and that make dad a harder sell
eli and warner best_friend since childhood have a thriving video_game business aid by a small team of employee and mostly impede by their clueless interfere father
the character be caricature and the joke be often unpleasant
eli be whiny and unprepossessing yet he have a revolving door of attractive woman eager_to be his girlfriend
when a pretty aspirant arrive for a party she perkily say you must be warner as he open the door
yeah do_not learn my name it_' easy that way warner reply
the pilot of dad cause a bit of a stir about stereotype and some advocacy_group be particularly offend when the chinese american employee veronica brenda song be instruct by eli and warner to dress up as a sailor moon like anime character to soften up chinese investor
veronica supposedly brainy tough and confident complies
mostly the show suffer from a more diffuse lack of imagination all the woman wife co_worker and even clean lady be castrate scold with little sense of humor
eli and warner be man boy and their father be gomer boy
mom which focus_on woman in recovery have a get straight message which may merely be a reflection of mr. lorre 's rather sobering experience deal_with charlie sheen at the height of that actor 's substance infuse public meltdown
like many show today dad be far_more cavalier about marijuana use
in the second episode warner and veronica put eli through an intervention to persuade him to go_back on pot because_they think he be more creative when he ' stone
the dad end_up consume the pot laced brownie hilarity do_not ensue
mom deal lightly with the serious problem of addiction and manage to be clever not sanctimonious

kafkaesque be not a word normally use to describe immune response but it_' how dr. louis j. picker describe what his experimental vaccine do to his rhesus monkey it_' like their t cell be turn_into the east german secret police hunt down infected cell until there be none leave
recent work by dr._picker a vaccine expert at oregon health science university have shake up the long frustrating search_for an aids vaccine
his late study publish in nature last_week have scientist scratch their head wonder_if it may open up a new avenue for research
dr._picker test his vaccine in 16 monkey who be then infect with simian immunodeficiency virus a close relative of h.i.v. which normally would have send them spiral rapidly down to a miserable death
the experimental vaccine protect only nine of them but it also do something never see before these monkey slowly clear the virus and now appear to be cure
three_year later you_can not tell them from other monkey dr._picker say
dr. anthony s. fauci the head of the national_institute for allergy and infectious diseases say the effect be unique
and dr. barton f. haynes the director of the human vaccine institute at duke university 's medical_school say it be potentially extremely important to understand how this happen
scientist often test idea for potential aids vaccine by create similar one against s.i.v. never before have one eliminate an exist infection
in that sense the effect of dr._picker 's vaccine be less like that of a measles or flu shot and more like that of the aids cure use in two famous case know as the berlin patient and the mississippi baby
the berlin patient timothy ray brown be infect with h.i.v. and cure only by obliterate his immune system to defeat his leukemia and then inject bone marrow from a donor with a rare h.i.v.-block mutation
the unidentified baby be bear to an infected mother in mississippi and apparently infect with h.i.v. but then cure with early and large dos of antiretroviral drug
both now appear to have no h.i.v. lurk deep in their body but it be impossible to be sure because not every bit of their tissue can be test
because he work with monkey dr._picker be_able to do something that would be unthinkable with human patient necropsy them grind up every organ and take 240 sample from each to be sure that they harbor no hidden virus
make vaccine by simply weaken the virus that cause aids have fail because the virus mutate a hundred time faster than even the fast mutate flu virus
in dr._picker 's vaccine s.i.v. gene be fuse to those of another virus the cytomegalovirus
the name mean big cell and it be in the herpes family but different from its relative that cause lip and genital sore chickenpox and shingle
h.i.v. fusion have be try with adenovirus and others but cytomegalovirus seem to work better
it_' not_entirely clear why but one theory be that cytomegalovirus have a very long history of infect primate so_much so that 100_percent of monkey and about 80_percent of human get it in their lifetime
therefore we primate have adapt to it
although the virus can be lethal to fetus and to those with immune system suppress by aids or transplant drug in most victim it cause no symptom
the body respond to cytomegalovirus more slowly and calmly than it do for_example to a flu
as in any infection the thymus gland generate new white blood cell call t cell in this case cd8 hunter killer cell prim to target the specific virus
but in the case of dr._picker 's vaccine those cell stay in an_unusual half alert state
a full blown immune response eventually exhaust itself and can even be dangerous
for_example the rare human who catch h5n1 bird flu often die of the immune response itself they drown in the flood of cd8s and other would be savior pour into the lung tissue spoil for a fight
that half alert state be the kafkaesque element unactivated cd8s wander around aimlessly while fully activate one behave like storm trooper
but the half activate cd8s persist in tissue eliminate their target quietly without trigger inflammation or even a mild fever
when s.i.v. gene be fuse to the cytomegalovirus spine the cd8s kill s.i.v.-infected cell too
since it protect only some monkey the new technique may be best use in combination approach
for_example dr. fauci say it could be give with a vaccine that generate antibody against h.i.v. and maybe eliminate the cell that sneak past the antibody shield
alternatively the vaccine may be give to infected patient who be on antiretroviral drug to see if it can mop up linger reservoir of virus
it should take up to three_year to get a human version ready for trial dr._picker estimate
now the outstanding question be why only half?'â say dr. mike mccune an aids researcher at the university of california san_francisco refer_to the monkey who be protect in dr._picker 's trial
too_often aids advance that work in lot_of monkey do_not work in many human
not all monkey be the same dr. mccune say
they_'re not as inbred as mouse but they_'re sometimes from the same family they get the same diet
who know_what will happen if this go into human
washington factory output surge in_august as the pace of motor vehicle production jump to a six_year high a hopeful sign for the economy after a slow start to the third_quarter
although another report on_monday show a slight slowdown in factory activity in new_york state this_month new order and shipment in the state rise all point to an increase in manufacturing after weaken in the spring

manufacture production advance 0.7 percent the federal_reserve say
the increase help to lift overall industrial production by 0.4_percent in_august
factory output have lag solid gain in the institute for supply management 's index of manufacture activity
the sharp recovery in the i.s.m. since may follow now by this surge in manufacturing output be encouraging sign that the spring soft patch in factory activity be over say ted wieseman an_economist at morgan stanley
in a separate report the federal_reserve bank of new_york say its empire_state general business condition index slip to 6.29 in september from 8.24 last_month
a reading above zero indicate expansion
even as activity in new_york state slow business be confident about the future
the survey 's index of six_month business condition approach a one and a half year high in september a good sign for business spending
the improvement in industrial output last_month point to some underlie momentum in factory activity which support economist forecast of only a mild slowdown in economic_growth this quarter
this momentum be likely_to encourage the federal_reserve to begin wind down its economic_stimulus when its policy_maker meet on_tuesday and wednesday to assess the economy 's health
the economy continue to expand at enough of a pace where we be create job and help to bring down the unemployment_rate say gus faucher senior economist_at the pnc financial services group
i would not be surprised to see an announcement on_wednesday that the fed will begin reduce its $_85 billion a month in purchase of treasury and mortgage_back security
gain in manufacture output last_month be lead by a 5.2 percent rebound in auto production which have slump 4.5 percent in_july
it be the large increase since november and it take auto production to an 11.25 million unit annual_rate the high since june 2007
there be also increase in the production of consumer good high_tech equipment machinery aerospace and electrical equipment and appliance
utility output fall for a fifth consecutive month in_august a decline economist attribute to a relatively cool summer and difficulty adjust the series for seasonal fluctuation
the amount_of industrial capacity in use creep up to 77.8 percent from 77.6 percent in_july
capacity use which can indicate how_much factory can increase production before economic_growth become inflationary be still 2.4 percentage_point below its long run average
there be no_evidence of any inflation pressure at this point in the production cycle say joseph lavorgna chief_economist at deutsche_bank

andy samberg and andre braugher man child and man 's man make their debut as sitcom lead in fox 's new cop comedy brooklyn_nine nine on_tuesday night
that the show be not nearly as distinctive as its two star be a disappointment but in a way it_' also a virtue
mild affable and familiar brooklyn_nine nine be a show the whole family can snicker at
and there_' something to be say for that in a season when most of the other new sitcom be self conscious star vehicle the crazy ones the michael_j. fox show portrait of family dysfunction mom the millers or salute to unchecked testosterone dad we be man
in that context a loose jokey workplace comedy look_like a relief
the throwback feel of brooklyn_nine nine be build into the premise
it belong_to a narrow genre the squad room sitcom whose most notable example remain the 1970s classic barney miller
and the relationship between mr. samberg 's detective jake peralta and mr. braugher 's capt
ray holt stem_from an even old and more celebrated show they_'re a modern manscaped version_of hawkeye pierce and colonel potter in m*a*s*h.
not that you_want to think_about that comparison for more_than a second
like pierce peralta be both anti establishment and supercompetent he organize fire extinguisher race and refuse_to wear a tie but he ' also we_'re tell the best detective in the precinct
unlike pierce he do_not have a serious edge or an excuse artillery fire incessant carnage for his manic immaturity beyond be the central character in a 21st_century sitcom
and despite its fond association brooklyn_nine nine create by dan goor and michael schur who be writer and producer on parks and recreation be thoroughly contemporary in its sketch comedy style structure emphasize throwaway joke physical humor and visual punch line like an amusing mod squad reference while avoid anything resemble story development
crime be solve in the pilot episode but you wo_not remember who do what or why
you will remember that andy samberg tie a tie around his waist and wear a psychedelic speedo and that deli meat and cheese be throw lead someone to yell that ' a waste of manchego and that andre braugher say it_' over disco man put down the yo yo and back away_from the girl in his voice of god baritone
whether brooklyn_nine nine will be consistently humorous enough to warrant attention be debatable from the pilot it_' not great
that the hoary he ' right behind me be not he
gag be use several_time or that the funny thing in the episode be a nearly silent 26-second cameo by fred armisen
it should continue to score well in likability though
mr. braugher show that deadpan humor be a solid component of his formidable arsenal and mr. samberg be charming and nicely self efface
in the support cast of cop joe lo truglio and stephanie beatriz stand_out as the well mean klutz and the scary tough cookie
like parks and recreation or even barney miller brooklyn_nine nine could just possibly grow into something great than the sum of its quirk

mrs. clandon be the very model of an_independent 21st_century woman
too bad she live at the turn of the 20th_century
to the shock of victorian society mrs. clandon robin leslie brown abruptly flee her unhappy marriage in england for the lush exotica of a portuguese island
there she create a new life for herself and her three child by write twentieth century treatises a best sell series of manifesto on parenting cooking conduct clothing and of course gender relation which her carefully indoctrinate offspring frequently quote back to her
that ' the back story for george bernard shaw 's you never can tell a subversive comedy of error about man and woman 's negotiation over independence and marriage
when the play open the clandon clan have return home to england after 18 year of island living
the young_child twin play by emma wisniewski and ben charles a voluble and perfectly synced tweedledee and tweedledum soon unknowingly invite their father to a family lunch
but while the estranged spouse quarrel a reluctant romance blossom between the eldest clandon child a frequently flush amelia pedlow and a penniless dentist sean mcnall neither of whom be prepare_for sentimentality 's steel trap grip on their scientifically hone mind
for better or for bad their abrasive overly intellectualized courtship translate easily to today 's battle of the sex
but much of what be so revolutionary and outrageous about shaw 's plot twist and inversion of victorian more be lose in this production direct_by david staller
in particular the scene transition in which the twin waltz around the stage and blow some_sort of fairy dust upon various light fixture feel_like force whimsy
touch like this and other strained physical comedy gum up the pacing and blunt the sharp social commentary that mr. staller celebrate in the program note
while this pearl theater company revival may not deliver the sociopolitical punch that shaw intend it be still brighten by some strong performance particularly those of dan daily as a wizened waiter and zachary spicer as his son a smug barrister who have embarrass his servant class father by rise above his social status
it_' be a long time since i have see a play as brutal as carcass
it may be even longer before i can scrub its residue from my mind
severe and unrelentingly grim the piece be often difficult to watch several audience member flinch during its most vicious moment
yet carcass be also tough to look away_from especially in this cunning production that intensify every angry scene
write around 1905 by peretz hirshbein the story center on an embittered family lead by avrush its alcoholic patriarch
mend'l his slow witted son seethe over his_own misfortune and unrequited love while reyz'l avrush 's stepdaughter dream of better day
such hope be no_doubt futile and any flicker of tenderness be extinguish immediately
the script translate from yiddish by ellen perecman be reminiscent of bã¼chner 's woyzeck and the most pessimistic play of strindberg
it be present here by new worlds theater project which specialize_in english adaptation of yiddish theater
the dialogue be steep in threaten language and violent imagery
spit in her face mend'l demand that reyz'l do to her_mother
i hope you die a painful death he rag at his_own who be ill
this expressionistic staging direct_by paul takacs add to the menace the set by steven c. kemp be stark and claustrophobic the sound design by jeremy s. bloom eerie and pervasive
color be wash out and shadow creep into every corner the lighting be by dante olivia smith
it_' no_surprise that the program feature a work by egon schiele
as avrush david greenspan 's bile seep into every sentence
he ' an oily defeatist wallow in misery
alvin keith 's mend'l be a caged beat creature sometimes attack those around him sometimes shy away
mr. keith be a fearsome involved actor
rebekah levin 's reyz'l smoothly alternate between innocence and anxiety
thomas preece kathryn rossetter and robyn kerr round out the cast of six none of whom shrink from their character fury
carcass be certainly not for the casual theatergoer
but this rarely perform 70-minute work offer dark reward for those_who can stomach its depiction of physical and psychological cruelty
make no mistake the play be never fun
but it_' almost always fascinating
two venerable nonprofit_organization base in manhattan that provide health_care and rehabilitation service for blind and visually impaired people be merge with the top official of both group raise the possibility of broad affiliation among similar local group around the country
the two organization that be join force jewish_guild healthcare and lighthouse_international have slightly different specialty and slightly different patient population
the new organization will be know as lighthouse guild international
the lighthouse be a worldwide household name in term of vision service and the guild have highly develop model within health_care say dr. alan r. morse who be the president and chief_executive of jewish_guild healthcare and will have the same title in the new organization
both of our program will benefit_from each_other
joseph a. ripp who be the chairman of lighthouse_international and will be the vice_chairman of the combine organization say it could raise the profile of vision loss just as organization that concentrate_on heart disease and kidney disease have do for those illness
what ' happen be as the population age macular degeneration be become a serious issue for america mr. ripp say
the good_news be we_'re live long
the bad_news be we_'re most_likely to have vision issue as we get old
dr. morse have long warn_that diabetes and accompany vision loss be increase
dr. morse and the president and chief_executive of lighthouse_international mark g. ackermann say that for now the two operation would remain separate and at their current address
jewish_guild healthcare have its headquarters on west 65th street near central_park and run five adult health day care center around new_york state
lighthouse_international base_on east 59th street near park_avenue specialize_in low vision rehabilitation and social service and run a music school
mr. ackermann who will be the executive_vice president and chief operating officer of lighthouse guild international once the merger be complete early next_year say the combination round out the service that the lighthouse have and enable us to expand our treatment of the whole person with the mental_health service the guild offer
all 41 member of the board of the two organization will have seat on the board of lighthouse guild international
the chairman will be james m. dubin who be now the chairman of jewish_guild healthcare
he say the combined organization could have a strong voice in advocate program for the blind like the guild 's long_term manage care operation which be finance with federal medicaid money that be allocate by the state
if there_' a 2 percent cut which there be a year and a half ago our goal be to provide the same kind_of service and do it with less funding from the state mr. dubin say
we have to be cognizant of what ' go on in washington and albany and so do the lighthouse
jewish_guild healthcare be found in 1914 as the new_york guild for the jewish blind it change its name to the jewish_guild for the blind in 1960 then to jewish_guild healthcare in 2012
lighthouse_international be found in 1905 as the new_york association for the blind
lighthouse_international have a great name mr. dubin say add that there be 30 local group around the country whose name include the word lighthouse none affiliate with the one in new_york
we be hop to reach out and start some national affiliation
my guess be if we can affiliate with lighthouse in chicago dallas wherever we will learn from them just as they can learn from us
mr. ackermann who become the top official at the lighthouse four_year ago say he and dr. morse begin talk_about join force several_month ago
dr. morse have work on research paper with dr. bruce rosenthal who lead the low vision clinic at the lighthouse
our staff cooperate all the time dr. morse say but it_' be on a casual ad hoc basis nothing institutional
there be linkage between the guild and the lighthouse and the lighthouse and the guild on many level
their teacher talk with our teacher our rehabilitation professional talk with theirs
he say their discussion evolve through the summer
finally he say it be why have not we do this before?'â

the large agency hold group in advertising be seek to revive its small agency network
the holding group wpp base in london want_to bolster a collection of agency know as the united_network form in_2006 from an agency network call red cell united
to that end matt ryan who most_recently hold senior post at havas worldwide new_york be join the united_network as its global chief_executive base in new_york to serve_as a partner to ewen cameron the longtime chairman of the united_network
the goal of the united_network originally introduce under the name the voluntary united group of creative agencies be to offer marketer an alternative more creatively focused resource that be small than the four global agency network also own by wpp grey jwt ogilvy mather worldwide and y&r.
the idea behind a small agency network be that it can be more nimble and its principal can pay more attention to each client
also not every marketer need a giant agency with score of office around the world staff by phalanx of executive
part_of our armory at wpp be to have network with various structure and various appeal martin sorrell chief_executive of wpp say in a phone_interview from beijing add there_' a segment of the market where client want small network micro network mini network
it make_sense for us to have a network like this
the united_network have counterpart at the other agency hold group
among_them bartle bogle hegarty at the publicis groupe and lowe partners at the interpublic group of companies
there be also a number of mini network that be independent not part_of a hold group among_them gyro m&c saatchi and wieden kennedy
the eight office that make up the united_network be in london madrid milan new_york oslo paris seattle and antwerp belgium
they work for blue chip marketer like astrazeneca capital one coca cola ikea procter gamble red bull visa and vodafone
but the united_network may be too small even for a network mean not to be big
accord_to the trade publication advertising age the united_network 's revenue last_year total $_80 million compare_with $ 105 million at gyro $ 202 million at bartle bogle hegarty and $ 305 million at lowe partners
they be good individual agency good at what they do on an individual basis mr. sorrell say of the united_network office which include berlin cameron united in new_york and cole weber united in seattle
the next step he_add be pull the network together in a more cohesive way
in_june mr._ryan 52 leave havas worldwide new_york part_of the havas worldwide division of havas where he have be co chairman as_well as president for global brand
his departure come after andrew benett the new global president of havas worldwide take on add duty as chief_executive of the new_york office
before havas worldwide new_york mr._ryan lead help lead or hold senior post at agency that include change technology partners quintacom ryan drossman partners and ryan partners
the first thing i would say be that hire matt be a commitment by wpp and me to the idea of build united into what_we want it to be from the beginning say mr._cameron 49 acknowledge_that the united_network have be off the radar for a while
two reason for that low profile mr._cameron say be a focus_on grow the client we have and work with the wpp team process on project
his reference be to network dedicate to specific wpp client like team detroit for ford motor and red fuse for colgate palmolive
such collaboration keep the agency viable mr._cameron say but the problem with that strategy be that it create anonymity
to be a viable micro network i need a partner he_add
i_'m better with partnership than on my_own i be a planner by trade not a c.e.o. mr._cameron 's last partner andy berlin retire in 2008
mr._cameron say he be attract to mr._ryan 's experience in build global brand build agency
mr._ryan say he believe_that the united_network could use agency in the asia pacific eastern europe and latin america region although he_add it would be a big move if we go to 12 or 15 office in total
ask for a time frame for revitalize the united_network mr._ryan suggest it would be 12 18 24 month before big return would be obvious
mr. sorrell ask the same question reply as feasibly as possible and as quickly as possible
mr._cameron say he begin discussion with mr. sorrell to bring in a partner about six_month ago well before the announcement in late july that wpp would be displace as the world 's large agency hold group by a merger of the omnicom group and the publicis groupe
mr. sorrell also say the effort to revive the united_network be independent of and unrelated to the merger which may be complete by next_spring

washington on_friday senator jeff merkley an oregon democrat try_to phone denis mcdonough the white_house chief of staff with some bad_news as many as five democrat on the senate banking_committee be no vote for lawrence_h. summers the white_house 's favor candidate for the position of chairman of the federal_reserve
mr. merkley have patchy cellphone reception at the pendleton round up a rodeo in eastern oregon
mr. mcdonough be deal_with other business and could_not be reach so senator merkley leave a message with his staff
that spotty phone_call reflect the revolt of a number of prominent democrats many of them from the liberal wing of the party but not limited to it help to seal mr._summers 's fate
not even an official nominee yet mr._summers a former treasury secretary under president_bill clinton and a key architect of mr._obama 's economic_stimulus program face long odds in win senate confirmation
on_sunday mr._summers pull_out of contention cite a potentially acrimonious battle that could harm the economy and mr._obama 's presidency
senate_democrats do_not want the fight say one congressional aide speak on condition of anonymity
they do_not want another fight that divide democrats and bring back to the forefront a bunch of the issue we deal_with during the crisis and the bailout
the aide continue and they do_not want_to spend the political capital to get this guy through
ultimately they get their way
in its search_for a new fed chairman the white_house have for month center on mr._summers who smart after be pass over for the position when mr._obama decide four_year ago to name ben_s. bernanke to a second term as chairman
this time with mr._obama determine to replace mr._bernanke after eight_year in office the white_house have weigh other candidate include janet_l. yellen the fed_'s vice chairwoman and donald l. kohn a former fed official
but many top economic_policy official in the administration consider mr._summers who work intimately with them during the financial_crisis by far the best candidate
the white_house assign rob nabors a deputy chief of staff to work with him and recruit two former campaign consultant jim messina and stephanie cutter to talk him up to the press
but a number of senate_democrats rather_than wait for the nomination process to play itself out raise_concern as soon as his name surface this_summer his reputation for be a divisive colleague his perceive role in coddle wall_street and the lax regulation of derivative and complaint that he do_not support small community bank as much as the nation_'s giant financial institution among_other issue
in_july those senator strongly signal to the white_house that they prefer ms._yellen
senator sherrod brown of ohio draft and circulate a letter of support for her which 20 colleague sign include richard j. durbin of illinois the no 2 democrat
it be not a subtle maneuver one aide say
a diffuse group of democratic senator oppose to mr._summers 's nomination may not have scuttle it
but the lawmaker be concentrate_on the banking_committee where fed candidate must win a majority vote before they can go for a full senate confirmation
the senator and staff_member on the committee bat around the pro and con of mr._summers for week at time air their concern with a white_house that some official describe as receptive and some as dismissive
after return from the long congressional summer recess mr. merkley make an_attempt to parse out his colleague position on mr._summers during caucus lunch
he find that as many as four be oppose to or queasy about the potential nomination
mr. merkley and mr. brown be strong no vote
senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts have misgiving and prefer ms._yellen though her colleague be not sure how she would vote in committee
in time two more senator admit their concern
jon tester of montana decide he would oppose mr._summers
and heidi heitkamp of north dakota express some misgiving about mr._summers a senate aide confirm though those concern be never air in public
the senate banking_committee consist of 12 democrats and 10 republicans
every democrat in the no column would have to be balance with a yes vote from a republican to win the support of the committee
by mr. merkley 's count mr._summers may have need as many as five republican vote
for the white_house that would have leave two option senate aide say both unpalatable
the first would have be to lean on the democratic no vote ask member to agree to pass mr._summers out of committee even_if they intend_to vote against_him on the senate floor
but the white_house have not lay the groundwork for such a strategy
some democratic office have not hear from white_house representative about the nomination at all
the second option would have be to barter for republican vote
aide describe that strategy as possible many republicans would have be willing_to vote for mr._summers they say for a price
but hand the republicans leverage in the midst of the debt_ceiling and budget debate would have weaken the white_house 's hand
white_house adviser include mr. mcdonough and valerie jarrett be oppose to any such trade offs
mr._summers with his_own well hone political antenna pick_up the signal from washington
ms._yellen have again become the presumptive front_runner as she have be for much of the spring
senate_democrats for their part have make their thought on her know
despite lukewarm republican support she would almost_certainly sail out of committee and clear a full senate confirmation vote too

alfred n.y. it be just about the time they be go to turn_off the water that this village recognize it may have a college problem
for year resident have live in symbiosis alongside two school the private alfred university and alfred state college a part_of the state_university of new_york system
the school capitalize on alfred 's small_town charm the single stoplight the deer wander in the street while the village enjoy thousand_of student eat drink and spend at local establishment an_annual rush of revenue and revelry that arrive as autumn do
but clean up after those student be less appealing and make all the more_difficult because the college as nonprofit tax exempt entity be under no legal requirement to pay anything for public_service
a former tile manufacturing town in western new_york alfred have a shockingly skinny tax base a whop 90_percent of its assess value be estimate to be tax exempt
so last_year to try_to cover its cost the village tell the school they would have to pay more for their water
suny balk
and that be when the village make a quiet but firm ultimatum
pay up or go thirsty
it get their attention say virginia rasmussen a village board_member
and we get the check
with increase financial pressure_on municipality across the country as_well as on place of high learning town versus gown squabble over pilot payment an acronym for payment in lieu of tax be increasingly common and often contentious
in_july gov. lincoln chafee of rhode_island sign a bill require bryant university to negotiate a payment for service with its hometown smithfield
pilot fight have also get testy in pittsburgh where the city and the university of pittsburgh medical_center have sue each_other over the center 's tax exempt status and in princeton n.j. where the approval of a $_300 million art center for princeton university be dog by question over how_much the ivy league institution should pay into local coffer
such dispute usually involve major institution and the city that host them
it be rare for a battle to break out in a tiny spot like alfred despite financial strain that can be acute
it be a perennial problem in these community say peter baynes the executive_director of the new_york conference of mayors which have argue unsuccessfully for change in state law to allow local government to require payment from tax exempt entity
and certainly while they would not want_to trade those school there be this fiscal recognition that while 100_percent to the community be receive the service only a fraction of the community be pay
tax_free policy have also be in the spotlight in new_york
in_june gov._andrew m._cuomo sign a new law allow suny branch and some private college to offer tax_free zone for new business that open on or adjacent to their campus
while official in village like alfred and other upstate college town like the idea of more job the idea of more tax_free property be less appealing
you_'re take more stuff off the table say justin grigg the mayor of alfred and a professor_at alfred university
and it_' a pretty small table already
and it be not just in his town he_add
this be not just an alfred problem mayor grigg say
this be a statewide problem
he mention mr._cuomo 's plan in a letter send to alfred state and alfred university in_june ask each to voluntarily pay $ 75,000 this_year for public_service say we be concerned_about tax_free campus be wrap by tax_free business
but the governor 's_office say locality do_not need to worry_about lose income under the new law because business that open on property adjacent to tax_free school will not be automatically take off the local tax roll although their employee will be exempt from state tax
in many way alfred be much_more college than village
the full_time taxpaying resident population be only about 1,000 many of whom work at or make a living through business from the college

east rutherford n.j. there be an excess of negative statistic to cull from the giants 41 23 loss to the denver broncos on_sunday but there be one measurement view with a twist that_is more illustrative than any_other
the giants be 1 for 11 in third down conversion
that be a staggering lapse but in truth the problem be not third down it_' first and second down
the giants be average 2.2 yard a carry and only 36.5 rush yard a game
the inability to run the football be destroy every tenet upon which the giants offense be build
an effective run game on first and second down not only put the giants in attainable third down situation it allow eli manning to make credible play action fake in the backfield a necessity for downfield pass
in a quiet giants locker_room manning say in effect on_monday that oppose team be unaffected by his play fake
the giants be waste time try them
before the snap the defense have_already align itself to play the pas and ignore the feeble running attack
if_you 're not run the ball well they can keep the safety very deep manning say
it_' not really a play action situation
and when the giants get nowhere on the ground on first and second down even a top level quarterback like manning become overmatched by the defense 's strategic advantage
we have four third down where it be third and-13 or more manning say
those be hard to convert
the giants be also in two third and-8 a third and-9 two third and-10 and a third and-11
there be nothing inside football about this
it_' elementary
but what should worry every giants fan be whether there be anything the team can do about it before next season
the new start run_back david wilson have yet to show he can run between the tackle
the backup be brandon jacobs who run for 4 yard on seven carry sunday and now have 11 rush yard in 12 carry during his last two n.f.l. season
the third back be da'rel scott a second year player with promise but little experience
the rushing trouble be not the fault only of those hand the football
as coach tom coughlin say about the running game sunday we_'re certainly not knock them back off the ball
an offensive_line have often be liken to a clenched fist
because of injury the offensive_line have not be together as a unit to deliver many punch
and there may be big concern than continuity
the preseason starter at right tackle david diehl be out with a thumb injury
center david baas and right guard chris snee be come off injury
right tackle justin pugh be a rookie
be a clenched fist even possible at this point
after watch videotape of sunday 's game leave guard kevin boothe say on_monday that the blocking problem be not cause_by breakdown up and down the line but by the failure of different individual at different time
we have a number of play where everything be go right
but we have a breakdown in one area he say
or as manning put it it_' not one guy mess up over and over and it_' not everybody mess up
but like anything_else one breakdown can ruin everything
if the offensive_line 's problem be not resolve soon where can the team turn
there be no seasoned veteran wait in reserve
diehl will return to the lineup but he struggle last_season as_well
and what of wilson the close thing to a savior at run_back that the giants have
until andre brown come_back from his broken leg in mid november and in retrospect brown 's absence have be devastating wilson be the only answer
but the 5-foot-9 205-pound wilson simply may not be a back in the classic giants mold
the offensive coordinator kevin gilbride may have to find way on first and second down to get wilson the ball in unconventional way to use his speed and quickness away_from the congested middle of the line
you_can find way to give him the ball and get him in the open field manning say
we may need to do that and use him somewhat differently
manning look hopeful but concerned as if he know_what be at stake
the rest of the locker_room be wait too
the running game be not do well defensive_end justin tuck say
and i_think that ' make eli press a little
the chemistry be not click right_now
but i mean i have no_doubt they will figure it out
the season probably rest on it
tokyo
each day_before dawn the world 's large fish market come to life in frantic activity a last holdout of an old quainter japan
worker in rubber boot slosh through inch deep water while others dart by on motorize cart carry plastic foam box with every manner of creature that can be haul from the sea from dagger shape silver sardine and spider like crab to the deflate protoplasmic blob of mysterious deep sea predator
in one corner auctioneer loudly hawk the huge frozen torso of prize tuna lay in row on the floor
nearby fishmonger in open air stall carve the tuna flesh into ruby red brick for sale to sushi bar and grocer
soon it will be go
the city be plan to spend $ 4.5 billion to relocate the market nickname tsukiji for the neighborhood that surround it to a modern climate control distribution center on a manufacture island in three_year
the move be part_of a broad face lift tokyo be plan before the 2020 olympics
for the many who have oppose the change the relocation will bring not only the loss of a historic 78-year old marketplace but also another blow to a vanish way of life
tsukiji have be a place_where merchant haggle face to face and where even the lowly fishmonger display the obsession with freshness that help japan bring sushi to the world
its passing be part_of a broad transformation away_from the tiny mom and pop shop specialize_in everything from tofu to rice cake that have be increasingly replace by big box supermarket and fast food chain
official_say they want_to redevelop the market 's approximately 50 acre of land value in the billion of dollar into high rise apartment_building and a tunnel that would connect tokyo to the island that will house new olympic site
they and many who work at the market also say the move be necessary to keep up with changing time as the same fast food chain and supermarket that have change tokyo 's urban landscape have increasingly shun tsukiji as too expensive and slow
opponent counter that the relocation be yet_another example of the skewed priority of japan 's development happy bureaucrat who they say want_to tear down what have become one of the city 's most_popular tourist destination to enrich big construction company and real_estate developer
tsukiji be the beat heart of the sushi culture that spread across the world say kazuki kosaka a former local assembly member who oppose the relocation
and now it will be redevelop into condominium
when move tsukiji be first propose 14 year_ago it spur widespread opposition even lead to rare street protest
they be lead by so_call middle wholesaler the traditional middleman who buy from big wholesaler and sell to restaurant and other retailer they fear the new market would allow large corporate wholesaler to squeeze them out
in 2001 the plan appear doom after the discovery of toxic contaminant at the new site which have house a refinery for convert coal into natural_ga
but city official be undeterred chip away at opposition by offer subsidy to help pay for the move
last_year the union represent the middle wholesaler who number about 700 switch its position and come_out in favor of the move which be consider a do deal bar some last minute reprieve
after delay tokyo say it be on track to complete the yearlong cleanup of the new site by march
worker there now spend their day scrap off several foot of contaminate topsoil to replace it with clean dirt
but critic fret that the cleanup will not convince skeptic that seafood whose value lie partly in its pristineness be safe
the tokyo government be use the olympics as an excuse to distract people from the contamination issue say makoto nozue 76 who have buy and sell tuna at the market for six decade
tsukiji be a globally known brand name and a cultural treasure

ephrata pa. they may be the most pampered chicken on the planet
on certain day a truck pull up alongside their quiet spacious coop on an amish farm here and deliver a feast that seem tailor to a flock of two legged aristocrat
before long the rust color bird be peck away at vegetable peeling and day old bread from some of manhattan 's most elegant restaurant like per se daniel gramercy tavern the modern and david burke townhouse
it be all part_of an experiment that be bring together elite chef preindustrial farming practice and a breed of french poultry that be rarely find in the united_states
the goal to see whether american restaurant can turn back the culinary clock and rediscover what a chicken should taste like say ariane daguin the pioneering businesswoman who be behind the idea
can scrap from acclaimed restaurant where the best ingredient be use create the table to farm to table chicken of the future and the past
new_york diner will get to nibble on the result this_week
after have be fatten up in pennsylvania about 220 of what the d'artagnan company be call green circle chicken will start show up usually roasted on dinner plate at the same restaurant that help fee them
for high end chef who engage_in a perpetual contest to track down the pure and most rarefied ingredient it be a tantalizing prospect
when i taste it i be like whoa,'â say jean georges vongerichten who plan to start incorporate the chicken into his ever evolve menu
witness say that after his first bite mr. vongerichten be on the verge of tear daniel humm the chef at eleven madison park consume an entire chicken in one sitting
still a few raise eyebrow be to be expect
the image of chicken gorge on four star ingredient can seem a rather operatic manifestation of today 's obsession over food
i do think in some way it_' a wonderful reaction to corporate poultry and corporate farming in general say matthew mills a creator of fodder a satirical online show from the cooking channel
but at the same_time it swing so_far to the other side that it_' almost an onion headline
he cite a well_know episode of portlandia in which two diner aggressively interrogate a waiter about the provenance of a chicken
clark wolf a prominent restaurant consultant agree
on one side it sound kind_of wonderful and magical and on the other side it sound_like the big stunt i have ever_hear he say
i mean you_know let_them eat zucchini
ms. daguin the french bear founder and chief_executive of d'artagnan a company that have play a major_role in bring ingredient like foie gras game bird and berkshire pork into the broad american marketplace say that it be not a stunt but part_of a continue mission to change the world by change its palate
ms. daguin 55 recall move to greenwich conn. from france in 1977 to work as an au pair and get her first bite of mass produce american chicken
it be a crime she_say
for ms. daguin as for gallic chef like mr. vongerichten and daniel boulud a distaste for chicken that be mushy and full of water as she put it be intensify by nostalgic memory of chicken back home that wander around the yard nibble on carrot top onion skin and old baguette and end_up taste rich and meaty with an almost chewy texture
what would happen she wonder_if you take a heritage breed chicken in this case one common to gascony the region of southwestern france where she grow_up and feed it scrap from fine restaurant
for chef like michael anthony at gramercy tavern there be a philosophical appeal in find us for those scrap and in support a fresh but old school alternative to factory farming
we know the horror of the cage bird mr. anthony say
ultimately it come down to taste
in restaurant circle a chicken that taste like chicken be something of a holy grail
about half a dozen chef have sign up so_far though the roster of restaurant be still in flux
when ms. daguin approach mr. boulud with her proposal he grasp it instantly have grow_up with similarly pastoral experience
for me it be not a foreign idea he say
he contribute scrap from his restaurant as the food supply for a test run
of course these chicken be not din on stale loaf from grandmother 's breadbox
on a recent afternoon at the farm where a few hundred creature inhabit a peaceful 15,000-square foot coop that would dwarf the size of most new_york apartment they cluck and amble around pan of bread soak in fresh milk and white bucket full of leafy trimming that would make a tremendous tossed salad
some of this be nice stuff than i have to eat when i get home say mike charles a local poultry expert involve in the project 1_2 next_page
in the first hint of how the brain initiative announce by president_obama in_april could take shape an advisory group on_monday recommend that the main target of research by the national institutes of health should be system and circuit involve thousand to million of brain cell not the entire brain or individual cell and molecule
the national institutes of health work group be mean to focus specifically on how the federal agency should spend its $_40 million brain initiative budget in 2014
however dr. rafael yuste a neuroscientist at_columbia university who be not a member of the group say that the recommendation which he agree with be so ambitious that it could be a charter for neuroscience for the next 10 to 15 year
dr. francis s. collins director of the n.i.h. who accept the report and its recommendation say that he have ask the group lead by cori bargmann of rockefeller university and bill newsome of stanford to think big and that it would be the job of the n.i.h. to make actual spending decision
dr. bargmann agree that the overall goal of figure_out how circuit in the brain generate complex thought and behavior be not something to be tackle with the $_40 million that the n.i.h. hop to have for 2014
you_can not do all of that in year one you_can not do all of that with $_40 million and you_can not do all of that at n.i.h. either she_say
the $_40 million for the n.i.h. be part_of a white_house proposal for $_100 million in spend on the initiative in the 2014 budget
the initiative also include money for the national science foundation and the defense advanced research projects agency
several major private research foundation be also join in the effort with their_own research

it propose nine high priority research area all of which could take many year and involve other agency and institution
but the report say dr. collins be a great blueprint for get start
comment during the presentation of the report which be open to the public online include some complaint from clinician that the money should be direct to other area like brain bank and specific disease
gerald rubin the executive_director of the janelia farm research campus in virginia part_of the howard hughes medical institute and one of the private partner in the overall brain initiative say he saw the report as more of a manifesto for get $_500 million a year

mayor_michael r._bloomberg the school chancellor dennis m. walcott and senior education official take a victory lap of sort on_monday visit 22 new_york city public school that rank among the state 's top 25 in reading and math exam give last_spring
the performance on the new exam which be some of the first nationwide to be align with a more rigorous set of standard know as the common core offer mr._bloomberg a chance to boast about his education record as his 12-year run as mayor come to a close
our administration_'s core philosophy when it come to education have always be if we raise our expectation our kid will meet them mr._bloomberg say at talented and gifted young scholars a citywide gifted school in east harlem that be one of the 22 high scoring school
the mayoral blitz carry_out with militaristic precision come as the two man campaign to lead the city in the post bloomberg era have be offer a stark contrast on educational issue
the democratic nominee bill_de blasio favor undo much of the bloomberg_administration 's centerpiece educational policy by slow the growth of charter school and end for at_least a year the practice of close low perform school
the republican_candidate joseph_j. lhota have defend the mayor 's record on education and want_to expand the number of charter school
mr. walcott have warn in recent_month that school would be in peril if the next mayor reverse mr._bloomberg 's policy
but mr._bloomberg have decide not to endorse anyone in the race and on_monday sidestep any discussion about his successor
all i know be what_we have do say mr._bloomberg who list some of the fact he deem creditworthy include the achievement of student the increase desire of family to be a part_of the school system and the city 's ability_to attract the best and the bright teacher from around the country
less_than one third of new_york city 's student pass the reading and math test this_year as score drop in virtually every school in the state
on the whole city student outperform those in other large district in the state and the city 's pass rate nearly match the state 's even_though the city have many student who be poor or not native english speaker
we have be close the gap with the state for a few_year now and that just have not happen to the best of my knowledge in any_other state where there be a_lot of big city mr._bloomberg say
but gap in achievement between black and hispanic student and their counterpart have continue to persist
and many of the 22 school that the mayor showcased on_monday be in well to do neighborhood or be highly selective in their admission include the anderson school no 1 in the state new explorations into science technology and math or nest+m no 4 the brooklyn school of inquiry no 18 and tag young scholars no 20
official however note_that seven of the school on the list be open after mr._bloomberg take office in 2002 include three that hew to the administration_'s goal of give poor student more choice the active learning elementary_school in queens and two success academy charter school in the bronx
batting away any criticism that most of the city 's student could_not score high enough to be consider proficient in english or math he say be we where we_want to be
no
and incidentally we will never be where we_want to be
this concept of proficiency be i have always think so misleading

when it come to make money twitter be all about keep it simple
there be no banner ad no dancing animation no ad insert between screen that you must click to get past
virtually all of the company 's revenue which be project to be nearly $ 600 million this_year and $ 950 million next_year come from three basic advertising format that blend smoothly into its core microblogging service whether user be access it from a mobile phone or a web browser
what they have be_able to do very well be develop product that meet the need of most advertiser without be overly complex say debra aho williamson principal analyst for social_medium at emarketer a research firm
but the simplicity of twitter 's product be also a weakness especially when compare_with other social network like facebook
the company do_not have concrete demographic information_about individual user like gender and age to allow it to sell highly targeted ad at expensive rate
and its marketing effort have largely be orient toward large advertiser in the united_states with few sale to small business and only about one fifth of its ad revenue come from overseas ms. williamson say
twitter which announce last_week that it have file confidential paperwork to begin the process of sell stock in an initial public_offering have disclose virtually no information_about its finance
the company decline to comment for this_article cite regulatory restriction surround its i.p.o.
but emarketer estimate that the company will bring in $ 583 million in revenue from advertise this_year and $ 950 million in 2014
twitter also make additional revenue from sell the data in its raw feed of hundred_of million of message daily
the most_common type_of twitter ad especially on mobile device be the promote tweet
essentially advertiser create a twitter message limit to 140 character like any_other message on the service and pay to insert it into the flow of message that a user see base_on certain trait like age gender or keywords that a person be interested_in
so if_you search_for apple iphone on_twitter the first message that be likely_to appear be a pay ad from google 's motorola unit which be run a campaign proclaim the virtue of its android smartphones love to talk
moto x respond to your voice no touch necessary read one or from microsoft which be push its windows phone device watch how the 41-megapixel windowsphone nokia lumia 1020 make any seat the best seat in the house
both company be bid against each_other to reach people interested_in the iphone
in many way the result resemble the ad that pop_up at the top of the page after a web search on google which also emphasize simplicity in its ad business
as with google twitter 's advertiser set key parameter like target audience and how_much they want_to spend and then computer program submit bid instantly to serve ad to available slot
advertiser pay only when someone interact_with an ad such as by retweeting it to their follower comment on it or mark it as a favorite
that typically happen only 1 to 3_percent of the time
to get that rate on the high side twitter 's system do_not just automatically award an ad slot to the high bidder instead it give an advantage to ad that previous viewer have find to be more relevant or engage
the holy grail for advertiser be an ad that be widely share by twitter user to their_own follower
to increase the chance of go viral brand will often embed photo and video into their ad
twitter 's other ad format be even simple
the company 's list of trend topic the most_popular 10 or so subject be discuss at any give moment on the service be well_know as a window into society 's transient obsession
advertiser can pay a flat fee to buy their way onto the list
the price for such a promoted trend which be clearly label vary by country but run about_$ 200,000 for 24_hour of exposure to every twitter user in the united_states
company or people seek to build follower for their account can also pay to appear on the top of the list of new account to follow that twitter suggest to each user
as twitter prepare to sell stock to the public the company be plan initiative that will add complexity to its advertising business while also diversify its revenue stream
last_week for_example it announce that it have agree to acquire mopub a start up that act as a middleman in place ad from marketer inside mobile application
mopub do something quite different from twitter auction off two billion ad slot a day in apps like songza and opentable through dozen of ad network and deliver the ad so quickly that a user fire up the app barely notice
but jim payne chief_executive of mopub say the two company share a common dna.
like mopub he say twitter be design to be mobile and it be design to be real time
he say twitter have promise to let mopub continue build out its current business even as the two work together to improve the ad offering on_twitter itself
ms. williamson the emarketer analyst_say mopub could become a significant source of revenue for twitter
mopub 's technology will streamline their self serve platform she_say
it give twitter entree into the real time bidding business the ad network business mobile app ad
through its amplify program twitter be also aggressively promote joint ad sale with television channel
espn for_example can show game clip on_twitter that be sponsor_by an advertiser with twitter and the channel sharing revenue

washington janet_l. yellen tell friend in recent_week that she do_not expect to be nominate as the next chairman of the federal_reserve
although she have be the fed_'s vice_chairman since_2010 and would make history as the first woman to hold the job president_obama 's aide make_clear throughout the summer that he want lawrence_h. summers his former chief economic adviser
now awkwardly it appear that the president may have to circle back to ms._yellen after mr._summers withdraw_from consideration on_sunday bow to the determined opposition of at_least five senate_democrats
on_monday ms._yellen become the front_runner by elimination official close to the white_house say
supporter of mr._summers include many of the president 's close adviser have raise some concern_about ms._yellen in recent_month
perhaps most potently they say that institution benefit_from fresh leadership and argue_that ms._yellen 's crucial role in create the fed_'s current policy could inhibit her ability_to make necessary change
some presidential adviser also argue_that mr._summers bring crisis management experience and a work knowledge of financial_market that ms._yellen lack although so do ben_s. bernanke when president_george w._bush select him as chairman
there have be tension_between ms._yellen and daniel tarullo a fed governor with close tie to the president 's economic team who have take a leading role on issue of regulatory policy
ms._yellen also clash with gene b. sperling head of the national economic council when both be adviser to president_bill clinton in the 1990
nonetheless the president 's adviser insist throughout the summer that mr._obama be not averse to ms._yellen but simply more comfortable with mr._summers a former treasury secretary to president clinton who be mr._obama 's chief white_house economic adviser through the height of the financial_crisis and recession in_2009 and 2010
in those year he form a bond with mr._obama and others in the white_house despite a tendency toward arrogance
stock_market soar on_monday on the withdrawal of mr._summers
many investor regard him as less commit to the fed_'s monetary_stimulus campaign than ms._yellen

ms._yellen 's supporter wait with a mixture of elation and apprehension for the president 's next step

administration_official and supporter acknowledge_that the president would enrage his party 's base if he be now to reject ms._yellen and forfeit the chance to name the first woman to the most influential economic job in the world
on the other_hand with no obvious alternative the choice of ms._yellen which month_ago may have be celebrate as historic be likely_to be see as mr._obama 's reluctant capitulation to his party 's left wing
that prospect and mr._obama 's distaste for be pressure into some action could prompt him to consider other candidate several former administration_official say
the president have_already interview donald l. kohn a former fed vice_chairman before ms._yellen get the job in_2010 on mr._obama 's nomination
for year mr. kohn be among the most influential adviser to former fed chairman alan greenspan and thus would have draw criticism from democrats many of whom blame the greenspan fed for an antiregulatory stance that encourage financial excess that lead to crisis 1_2 next_page

munich it be election season in germany and angela_merkel the chancellor be live through her bad nightmare
the allegedly most powerful female politician on the planet hat campaign politics
ms._merkel should be confident and upbeat
she have manage the euro crisis quite well the currency have not collapse and germans be do fine economically
she lead in the poll by a strong margin and enjoy remarkable approval rating despite be in office for eight_year
there be almost no chance of her lose her post when voter go to the poll on_sunday
still something smell foul and ms._merkel be grip by that wariness that usually befall her when thing be go too well
and this time she may be on to something be the woman who have succeed through an iron commitment to consensus and harmony too bore for germany
ms._merkel have never be good on the stump
she be elect chancellor twice but for her election evoke a sense of trauma
she almost lose to gerhard schrã¶der in 2005 despite a comfortable lead in the poll
four_year later despite strong poll number she again do bad than expect on election day though her position be secure by her strong coalition partner the free_democrats
when it come to election ms._merkel really be a bad politician
she have never manage to relax and show confidence on the campaign trail
in her only tv debate with her main challenger peer_steinbrã¼ck of the left lean social_democrats she seem distant and passive
on the stump she only recently go into attack mode and shy back again immediately
on syria she try_to offer support for america_'s effort against the use of chemical_weapon while also heed the german public 's aversion to military_action only to find herself vulnerable to criticism that she would either follow president_obama blindly or leave him in the lurch as she do in the libya crisis
she be not a fascinating speaker though in private she be highly engaging and even funny
she rarely make a bold move and even on minor issue she be cautious and think through the possible consequence over and over again
the paradox be that such weakness on the trail be strength in office
the chancellor 's_signature mark be her deliberate argument drive boring clinical policy style
she take a problem cut it into piece and try_to find a solution often heavily technical and always very detailed
during the height of the euro crisis this calm and deliberate style help her and though she have her critic she be arguably responsible_for save the euro_zone
so why be she such a coward in the campaign
why be she not cash in and invest some of the political capital she have amass
because ms._merkel can_not beat her bad enemy herself
ms._merkel be the master of harmony the den mother of one of the world 's rich economy
but that style almost by definition prevent her from take the offensive during a campaign
and after eight_year in office ms._merkel 's calm deliberative style may have run its course with german voter
she have basically suffocate most of her political opponent by absorb their position leave no oxygen for them to breathe
critic accuse her of suck all blood from the political life in germany a country that love consensus and be suspicious of too_much fighting
people want_to know_what they have to expect over the next four_year
they want_to have a choice
they deserve more_than a hint on how the most powerful country in europe finally want_to overcome the crisis on the continent
ms._merkel know this but she wo_not change
she dislike be compare to margaret thatcher but she subscribe to mrs. thatcher 's famous dictum the lady ' not for turn
this may come as a shock abroad where germany_'s neighbor be wait for election day as if it be christmas
they want and expect to see germany live up to its potential as a world leader whether it be on economic or security matter
but there be no gift await no new more robust german foreign_policy to emerge after the distraction of the election
no miracle will be perform on_sunday
regardless of whether she dominate the election or just squeak by ms._merkel will govern in the same boring deliberate style as before
step by step crisis after crisis
to seal her legacy as a great chancellor ms._merkel must now reinvent herself and show more leadership both at home and abroad
she need to take a risk or two and even be prepared to lose
she could afford it but will she

our billionaire mayor have see his golden touch turn to dross of late and so he decide that he would not bestow his endorsement on a successor
it be think the mayor have just one target for his electoral affection the republican joseph_j. lhota
but if legacy weigh on michael_r. bloomberg he may have consider stroll over to the beaux arts manhattan municipal building knock on the public_advocate 's door and offer his endorsement to bill_de blasio
new_york 's progressive choice may well have slip out the back door and clatter down the step to avoid that meeting
mr._de blasio have take great pain to frame himself as the anti bloomberg
but fact intrude
mayor bloomberg 's legacy be far_more progressive than mr._de blasio and his supporter let on
and the mayor may one day find_himself nod in grudge admiration as a de_blasio administration work to deepen and extend some of his policy
from affordable_housing to public_health to child welfare to the creation of park land to rework the city 's streetscape mr._bloomberg have an impressive progressive policy legacy
he be a fierce guardian of our endanger watershed
on global warming his propose marshland and natural barrier and tough but fair construction standard be a sierra club daydream
park land edge the waterway and innovative playground be find opposite the metropolitan_museum of art and at public school 181 at 1023 new_york avenue in east flatbush and in the farthest reach of far rockaway
in his first term he raise tax to protect service
he give big raise to teacher
whatever one make of his education reform and i be often critical he build grand new school and try_to crack open a calcified system
he be less a republican than a chameleon change affiliation from democrat to republican to independent as his electoral desire dictate
michael gecan and the industrial areas foundation a coalition of congregation and neighborhood battle this administration
but they also work with it to build a gleam school in mott haven in the bronx
and they build work class home in brooklyn across brownsville and east new_york
george bush do_not do that
or rick perry in texas mr. gecan note
those be not the action of a right winger
o.k. now that i have climb so_far out on this branch as to risk a tumble let_me inch back in
the mayor have be unyielding on stop and frisk policing tactic with their disproportionate effect on black and latino male
a mayor de_blasio would retain the tactic as a tool but significant change loom
culturally the mayor remain a man of wall_street which be to say a deep dyed capitalist
he do_not spend_much time contemplate his contradiction
he favor some government intervention outlaw smoking in bar and ban big urn of soda
but he talk as if others a few sick day for a pharmacy cashier
a living wage for a hard work janitor
threaten the foundation of this city
a mayor de_blasio offer the possibility of new path walk
he may press in albany to raise the minimum_wage
or he may reverse our conservancy drive tale of rich park poor park
chicago and seattle dedicate money for park be we so parochial as to think we have nothing to learn
mr._de blasio talk of pull on zone lever and push creatively to extend the city 's reach on affordable_housing
if he do so he will lean heavily on the bloomberg_administration 's creative financing program
nor be mr._lhota the wolf at the door of liberal fear
he be a new_york republican which in national term be awfully close to an irredeemable liberal
recently he claim he could deliver a $_500 million universal prekindergarten program without identify where he would get the money
how very john v. lindsay of him
mr._lhota and mr._de blasio finally may consider adopt a bloomberg trait
when face with complaint_about his initiative mr._bloomberg have an admirable willingness_to say feh
we will talk to you he suggest but we wo_not stop forever if_you disagree
would mayor lhota push business backer to swallow a high minimum_wage
could mayor de_blasio prevail upon the union for real concession
the other day mr._bloomberg say he want only to offer his successor a world class transition
what he may not realize be that even a liberal successor be likely_to stand more in his shadow than either man may guess

new delhi they can_not do without the farmer story
when people_who wish to transform india through the internet talk_about their plan they tend_to tell a story that go something like this a poor farmer be about to sell his crop very cheap when someone often a smart adolescent granddaughter check the market price online and the farmer make a more informed decision
it appear that technology executive feel they must treat the internet as something deeply noble and serious in order to substantiate its importance in an impoverished nation
even facebook that great time suck of farmville not farmer seem to have suffer a head injury and be now imagine itself as mother teresa
internet.org the company 's recent push along_with other company to bring affordable access_to the more_than two third of the world that be not yet online have the grave tone of social reformation
facebook 's founder mark zuckerberg say last_month that the goal be to create a backbone for many thing include access_to information access_to information_about health_care education job and just so_many good_thing
too_many people presume that what the poor want from the internet be the crucial necessity of life
in reality the enchantment of the internet be that it_' a_lot of fun
and fun even in poor country be a profound human need
quality of life be as much an assortment of happy frivolity as it be the bare essential of survival
and india be a perpetual reminder that a_lot of good even the somber sociological stuff can come from people set out in pursuit of joy
what the poor want from a technological revolution be probably best understand by watch the way they react to electricity
they do_not crave electricity so they can keep newborn warm in incubator
they want it for the simple pleasure
chibaukhera a village in northern india where electricity have be available only since march of this_year be now under the spell of television
as television set be much seek after and prestigious dowry several house have them even before they get electricity
now that the tv and plug have finally meet the villager be hook on hindi film and serial about family feud
in time they will have incubator too
it be not always true that entertainment be the collateral consequence of progress progress often be the collateral benefit of the pursuit of pleasure
so what be the problem if facebook and others have acquire a halo as they try_to reach out to develop nation with false notion about what the poor actually want
after all they do plan to bring the internet to place that do_not have access
but the tech industry 's misreading of the big audience in its_own revolution will lure it into commit the same mistake of so_many other altruistic project
the last 15 year have see numerous well intentioned mission to transform society through computer and the internet remember one laptop per child but few of them have have much impact
today of the roughly 207 million occupy rural home in india only about 1.2 million have computer with an internet connection
but there be 300_million cellphone subscription in these area
and accord_to a recent survey more_than seven million of those user connect to the internet only through their phone
the extraordinary triumph of the cellphone among india 's poor stem_from its ability_to enable a most mundane human need which be to chat with other people
and when the poor chat it be not always about cure a child of diarrhea
the indian government have several valiant plan to bring internet access_to the village but they largely center on connect government office for id database and for software simulation to teach citizen skill like plumbing
would not it be better if the poor be offer direct connectivity over their phone free or cheap and be leave to decide what they want_to do with it
mr. zuckerberg 's belief that connectivity be a human_right be honorable
where he and his allies err be in imagine that fun be not and in underestimate the power of entertainment to transform society
chat with friend online may not save the world but if it can get more people to log on the rest will follow
many year_ago when i work for a lifestyle magazine i be give my bad assignment ever
i have to call some of the rich people in southern india and ask them what they usually have for breakfast
the first man i call tell_me i do_not eat gold biscuit
it be a well deserve reprimand for presume that rich people be somehow different from other human
it be equally ridiculous to presume that what poor people want from the internet be lesson in plumbing

i be steer my cart through costco the other day wonder whether to waddle to the aisle where they sell cashew by the quarter ton or to the one with thousand piece pack of chicken thigh when an epiphany pierce the fog of my gluttony
actually two epiphany
the first
i need to have kid four or five or better yet a baker 's dozen
only then could i take full advantage of the saving around me
the second
costco as much as anything_else be why the land of the free and the home of the brave be also the trough of the tub o lard our exceptionalism measurable by not only our g.d.p. but also our b.m.i.
that ' body mass index and our body be indeed massive
i do_not blame costco per se
i blame what it represent an american obsession with size with quantity that manifest itself as surely in supermarket and restaurant as it do on our highway
we drive minivan and sport utility vehicle we rip into veritable feed bag of potato chip and wedge our steroidal thanksgiving turkey into refrigerator more capacious than some european car
this do_not redound to our benefit
and while the notion that we weigh too_much because we buy order and eat too_much may be obvious it_' increasingly obscure
study after study and report upon report look_at more particular reason for obesity and excess pound focus_on the edge and the aggravator of the problem instead of the flabby core
and the number and variety of these investigation not to mention the prominent showcase we in the news_medium give them create the impression that alchemy not appetite be our enemy and that if we could just fine tune our daily schedule rejigger our protein to carbohydrate ratio or wallow sufficiently in fiber all would be well
it_' as if we_'re micro focus_on less daunting and less damning culprit to distract ourselves from the one that ' most fearsome and difficult to change which be the sheer volume of food that many americans be accustomed to consume
in the times alone over the last six_week i have read story or blog post about research that explore the effect of a proper breakfast on weight loss the implication of gut bacteria on a person 's tendency to be fat or thin the impact that sleep deprivation can have on dietary craving the possible utility of strenuous exercise as an appetite suppressant and the unhealthy food choice that a favorite sport team 's defeat can cause
the examination of how and why we overeat be like some full employment scheme for physician nutritionist scientist and professor who have look_at the role of alcohol of additive of peer pressure of bribe
one book that land on my desk recently posit that pollution be make us fat and trace the parallel rise in air conditioning and obesity
but these expert have not bring us clarity
we have be tell that snack be good and that it_' not that fruit and veggie will save the day and that they wo n't that more exercise mean few pound and that it make no difference
what i have see with my_own eye and can intuit with common_sense be more consistent and persuasive
for a few_year i live in italy where people be generally thin than in america and i learn that it_' not because_they walk all that much_more one popular theory or smoke away their hunger another
it_' because_they do_not celebrate huge serving the way that americans do and do_not pig out as much as a result
the mcdonald 's near my office in rome do_not supersize anything
i_saw no roadside sign for all you_can eat buffet
i never encounter a never end pasta bowl ã la the olive garden nor a denny's style grand_slam

such prompt and cue make a difference
in a famous experiment eight_year ago a cornell university professor name brian wansink put stale and presumably awful tasting popcorn in large bucket and in really large one

the vessel goad them to

they have teach us that volume equal value and establish a dangerous baseline for what_we consider a sane amount_of food
and that ' a bedrock truism that must not get lose amid a smorgasbord of other wonky insight many helpful to a point none erase the importance of portion size

he have so little need of those_who say they have need of him he want never to see any of them again though he would not say so
for once in his life he be satisfied simply to be simply to be
to be nobody nobody but himself himself without himself
he feel empty and full not one or the other but both at once
he feel chafe like a child full of flout wish floating elation
but drain of hankering like a glass of water a thirsty man just drink
he consider someone odd though familiar may have come to live inside of him
maybe it mean he be shelter someone_who need a home
he himself have no home flit from friend to cousin to stranger as the occasion demand or urge by the heart which he often misread
he live everywhere but at home where sometimes he stay overnight
anywhere he sleep he be at home if he do_not overstay
the city he wish most to live in be nearby but quite far_away
near enough to visit or be visit by old friend and child far enough off to forget them all in a week or a year
he want_to live alone in a den like apartment work night on his thought or in a big rambling house without tenant and close to the hub of the city
he would like also not to live there but still to call it his home where he could drop in surprise himself hard at work in his study or have be call away find the place shriek his absence
he would like to live there and in the country as_well unknown except for the ga meter reader who would fade in and fade out bimonthly
he once write a letter he think he would only half write himself which end limply how_many empty like me be there leave to pick_up before i die
now he believe the letter be write completely by someone else
of course he be wrong but what if he be completely somebody else

washington first come the supercommittee task in_2011 with find a bipartisan deficit reduction plan but doom to fail
then come the mcconnell plan a way for congress to raise the government 's debt_limit without actually vote to do so
and in_january there be no budget no pay a measure couple with the last debt_ceiling increase to deny paycheck to lawmaker if_they do_not pass a budget
for three_year congressional leader have rely_on tactical maneuver sleight of hand and sheer gimmickry to move the nation from one fiscal crisis to the next with little strategy to deal_with the actual problem at hand
medicare and social_security continue to swell with an age population
health_care cost grow
a burdensome tax code remain unchanged and economic revival be shadow by the specter of washington 's crisis drive mismanagement
now with a government_shutdown loom at month 's end and a crippling default on the nation_'s debt possible by mid_october congressional leader may have run out the string on legislative trickery
conservative republicans in the house have declare they will not go along_with any more gimmickry from their leadership
democrats have vow they will not help republican_leader out of their jam without some easing of spending_cut
and a way forward to keep the government operating and solvent and to protect the international economy from a default drive shock wave be nowhere to be find as the house be set to vote this_week on a stopgap spending plan
what be cause this be the inability at_least to this date of our nation_'s leader in the house and white_house to make good decision timely decision that put our country first say representative scott rigell republican of virginia
it_' really no_surprise that we_'re in this bind
president_obama join the fray monday castigate republicans for the late budget crisis but hop that a light bulb go off
what_happen here in washington make a difference he say at a white_house event commemorate the fifth anniversary of the financial_crisis that help propel him to the presidency
what_happen up on capitol_hill be go to help determine not only the pace of our growth but also the quality of job the quality of opportunity for this generation and future generation
last_week with the body politic focused on syria representative eric_cantor of virginia the no
2 house republican trot out his answer to the late fiscal morass
first the house would pass stopgap funding legislation to keep the government open until mid december with a companion clause that would strip all funding to implement president_obama 's health_care law
sure the senate could simply ignore the health_care provision but mr. cantor assure house conservative he would come_back with an increase in the government 's borrowing limit that would delay the health_care law for one year
the conservative answer
a boisterous and resounding no
certainly we have often use insider washington rule and tool some would call them gimmick to protect people from hard vote say representative mick mulvaney republican of south_carolina
that ' be part_of washington a long time
but what_we 're see here be an unwillingness to accept this as a first step
you_can not start with a complete surrender
just five scheduled legislative day stand between the house and a government_shutdown
house republican_leader and their allies say there be still time to persuade their recalcitrant backbencher to go along_with the cantor plan or some variant of it
house_republicans will meet wednesday to hash over their option
but the division that have bedevil speaker_john a._boehner since he take the gavel in_2011 be back in force
it_' fair to say it look a little gimmicky but at_least it would prevent a government_shutdown say representative charlie dent a moderate republican from pennsylvania who back the plan
it_' important that republicans stop pretend that mitch mcconnell be the senate majority_leader and mitt romney be the president he say refer_to mr. mcconnell of kentucky who as leader of senate republicans head the minority party
conservative say they be tired of lose and they be be egg on by activist organization that be demand a hard line
from his new perch head the right lean heritage foundation former_senator jim demint have demand an end to pretend vote and gimmick
the conservative activist l. brent bozell iii be rally supporter around legislation that would strip all fund from the affordable_care act immediately say he will accept no less
the club for growth a political action committee not bashful about mount primary challenge to republican lawmaker from the right say it will put a black mark on the record of any lawmaker who vote even to bring the cantor plan to the house floor
and an expanding base of internet wire tea_party ground troop be keep the pressure_on
we_'re push back on these gimmick that use to be the coin of the trade in washington say michael a. needham chief_executive of heritage action the heritage foundation 's political arm
i_think it_' exciting
republican_leader can be forgive for their shell shock
for three_year such activist have generally look the other way as republicans finessed a path from crisis to crisis
in_2011 the house take the nation to the brink of its first ever debt default despite warning from economist that such a move could plunge the global economy into recession
the way out in part be a special select committee task with produce a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit by around $ 4 trillion over 10_year
the supercommittee fail but the legislation that produce it do lift the debt_ceiling
to do it however mr. mcconnell have to dream up another sleight of hand a two step process that allow president_obama to raise the debt_ceiling himself then give congress a vote to voice its disapproval
even_if that disapproval could pass congress it could be veto by the president
thus the government 's borrowing limit would rise without_any lawmaker have to vote explicitly to do it
earlier_this year house_republicans devise another plan to raise the debt_ceiling while extract only a token concession
that concession be the no budget no pay act which would have impound the pay of member of congress if_they fail to pass a budget
senate_democrats comply pass a budget and have berate the house for the past five month for refuse_to even try_to resolve the vast difference_between the house 's spending and tax plan and the senate 's
the house have also all but give_up on pass detailed spending_bill to comply_with its budget
if this be our approach to governance we be in deep trouble mr. rigell fume
with the clock tick frustration with what representative reid ribble republican of wisconsin call all_these fiscal cliff and this dance we go into all the time may be reach a crescendo
we just need to find a path forward and we have to get off these conversation about this small stuff mr. ribble say
it_' time we start to deal_with the real issue
an argument over the teaching of the philosopher immanuel kant between two man stand in line for beer at an outdoor festival in southern russia end when one man shoot the other in the head with gun load with rubber bullet the state ria news_agency report on_monday cite the police

teenager prosecute in adult court or who do time in adult jail fare bad in life and can go on to commit more violent crime than those_who be handle by the juvenile justice_system
neuroscience research have find that these young offender do_not weigh risk the way adult do make them prone to rash judgment that can land them in trouble with the law
these fact argue for steer adolescent into the juvenile justice_system where they can receive rehabilitative service and be spar adult criminal conviction that banish them to society 's margin and make it virtually impossible for them to find job
this logic have prevail throughout the country
but it have so_far be ignore in new_york state one of only two state the other be north_carolina that set the age of adult criminal responsibility at 16
thirty seven state and the district of columbia consider 18 as the age for adult prosecution and 11 state set it at 17
nearly 50,000 16- and 17-year old in new_york end_up in the criminal_court each year a vast_majority charge with nonviolent crime like fare beat marijuana possession or shoplifting
that may be change thanks to effort by group like raise the age ny a coalition of justice advocacy_group that argue for raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18
among_those who have rally to this cause be new_york state 's chief judge jonathan lippman and the nassau county district_attorney kathleen rice
judge lippman have submit a bill to the legislature that call for the formation of a special court for 16- or 17-year old charge with nonviolent crime
these youth division court would have judge specially train in issue of adolescent development and therapeutic approach to juvenile crime
if the case be resolve in the youth division no criminal_charge would be file against the child fingerprint would be destroy and all record would be seal
the goal be to treat child as child instead destroy their life even before they have begin
new_york 's decision make in 1962 to define juvenile as those under 16 be mean to be temporary
but inertia quickly set in cause the erroneous decision to stand for 50 year even as tough on crime state begin to see that teenager need special protection
it be well past time for new_york to adopt the same sensible policy

the idea of create extensive marine reserve in the southern ocean around antarctica seem_like a no brainer
the reserve would protect what be still the most pristine aquatic ecosystem in existence and they would extend to the ocean some of the international protection that the continent enjoy the recognition that the south polar region be a world treasure off limit to the frenzy of resource extraction play out across the rest of the planet
in_july at the most_recent meeting of the commission for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources in bremerhaven germany there be a nearly giddy sense of optimism that after repeat failure the proposal_would finally pass
but it fail again thanks largely to russia and ukraine who raise unfounded legal objection
and while not completely cave in fish nation like china norway and japan call for small reserve and a sunset clause that would allow for future exploitation and essentially render the whole idea of a permanent reserve meaningless
all this have lead the staunch supporter of the original 875,000-square mile proposal chiefly the united_states and new_zealand to do exactly the wrong thing
instead of go into the next_month 's meeting in hobart australia with renew determination the two country announce last_week that they would agree to shrink the propose reserve by 40_percent in the belief that something be better_than nothing
this decision reward without a fight the country that oppose the reserve and it seem to have more to do with preserve a process than preserve an ecosystem
it make everyone even the good guy complicit in failure
and behind it all be blindness to the true cost of fish the antarctic as hard as the rest of the ocean and an inability to grasp the fragility of that antarctic and the importance of one of its main specie krill to the rest of the ecosystem
the united_states and new_zealand and the european country that support the marine reserve have it right the first_time

william thompson jr. make a gracious exit from the race for mayor of new_york on_monday throw his support to bill_de blasio who probably get slightly more_than 40_percent of the vote in last tuesday 's democratic_primary which he need to avoid a runoff with mr._thompson
we say probably because the new_york city board of elections have not finish count the vote
for the last_week mr._thompson have be in the awkward position of hang around to see whether mr._de blasio 's unofficial 40.3 percent hold up
mr._thompson who get 26.2 percent of the vote saw that his odds be very long and get on with his life
in leave the race mr._thompson call the board 's failure to deliver official result nearly a week after the vote a disgrace
he ' right though its incompetence be hardly a surprise
this be the election after all where more_than 5,000 antique lever action voting machine have to be drag out of storage because the board know it could_not get optical scanning machine ready for a possible runoff
the board whose member be appoint by county leader of both party be a patronage riddled agency with one job which it do very poorly
last friday worker be catch snooze among the voting machine they be suppose_to be rechecking
the most appealing solution be just to abolish the board as mayor_michael bloomberg have urge for year and to replace it with a nonpartisan body of skilled professional
but that would require rewrite the state constitution which the legislature would resist
good government organization like the new_york public interest research group say there be many way to make the board work better like have city employee replace inept poll worker on election day and have the city_council vet its appointee more strictly
perhaps a good civic minded project for mr._bloomberg speaker christine quinn and mr._thompson all of whom know_how to run big operation be to take on reform of this abysmal system

the supreme_court have deliver that message repeatedly over the last decade in limit or flatly prohibit the most severe criminal punishment for those under 18 at the time of their crime
in 2005 the court ban the death penalty for juvenile
in_2010 it outlaw sentence of life_without parole for juvenile convict of crime other than homicide
and in a 2012 case miller v. alabama it say juvenile may never receive a mandatory sentence of life_without parole which prisoner refer_to as the other death penalty
each ruling rely_on the eighth amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment have find that young_people be constitutionally different from adult and therefore must be punish differently
in each case the court be silent on the question of whether its ruling apply retroactively to inmate who have_already be convict
the just answer would surely be yes and court have largely agree make those first two juvenile justice ruling retroactive
but some state insist_that the ban on mandatory life_without parole do_not apply to offender who have_already be sentence
in the miller case the court require low court to make individualized sentencing decision for juvenile defendant because juvenile be not as morally culpable as adult and they be more capable of change over time
if the ban on mandatory life_without parole be retroactive more_than 2,000 prisoner would be eligible_for a new sentencing hearing
so_far whether these individual can get a new hearing depend_on where they live
court in michigan iowa and mississippi have rule that the ban apply to previously sentence juvenile
the department of justice take that position as_well
yet the minnesota supreme_court and one federal appeal_court have take the opposite view
on_sept. 4 the louisiana supreme_court take on this question in the case of darryl tate who be 17 when he hold up two man and kill one of them in 1981
mr. tate 's lawyer argue_that he be entitled to a new sentencing hear under the miller rule because the united_states supreme_court allow such a rehearing in another juvenile life_without parole case decide at the same_time as miller
critic fear that allow resentencing would increase violent crime
but court may still impose life_without parole provide that the judge first give proper consideration to the mitigating effect of youth
the alabama supreme_court set out guideline last_week that require a court to consider 14 factor include a defendant 's age emotional maturity family environment and potential for rehabilitation before issue such a sentence
ideally life_without parole would never be a sentencing option for juvenile
the supreme_court 's own logic suggest this even_if it be not willing_to go that far
after the miller case three state entirely eliminate juvenile life_without parole join six other state that have_already ban the sentence and lawsuit on the retroactivity issue be pending in several state
as lawmaker and court deal_with this issue they should remember as the supreme_court have declare that adolescent be not adult and that principle should apply regardless of the date of a conviction

mr. hirsh put his finger on the chief deficiency of online education the absence of creativity that flourish in a world that student and teacher investigate together
education be not simply the delivery of information but a flow transaction in which student and teacher grow in reaction to one another collaboratively create something new and unforeseen
when i teach my music course the most thrilling aspect be the spontaneity the opportunity to be a reflective practitioner respond to idea and personality and the opportunity my student have to exchange opinion and construct knowledge together

to the editor your sept._11 editorial the race to improve global health rightly point_out that we still have a long_way to go particularly in save mother life the aim of the millennium development goal on maternal health and universal access_to reproductive health
but many_people may not realize_that the lead cause of maternal death be largely preventable and treatable with inexpensive antibiotic and medicine that can stop postpartum bleeding and life threaten hypertension and seizure
even the simple of supply soap and sterile razor can save the life of a mother as she deliver
the tragedy be that these basic inexpensive supply available everywhere and take for grant in rich country be scarce or nonexistent in the poor one
increase access_to basic medicine and clean supply would save the life of more_than 180,000 woman every year and as many as a third of vulnerable life could be rescue if woman have access_to contraception to plan their pregnancy 222 million woman still lack this
in the 21st_century no mother should die bring new life into the world especially now that we know_what to do as we get close to the deadline of the millennium goals

the writer be executive_director of the united_nations population fund
to the editor we agree that the united_nations millennium development goal galvanize the world into respond to extreme poverty and chronic health_problem and that more money and intensive effort be need to achieve the goal that be lag
however a great insistence on good governance and on a new governance goal be essential to achieve current and future development goal
it be possible to measure the impact of governance on the number of child in school and on maternal mortality
our research show that where bribery be low and where there be transparency in how government spend money people have better access_to education health and basic service like clean water
galvanize government around good governance can significantly help to meet the development goal at their halfway mark in 2015 and take us beyond to reach new goal for 2030

to the editor be suburban_sprawl on its way back news analysis sunday_review sept._15 question_whether suburban_sprawl be on the resurgence
what i know as an urban mayor be that our city be grow and flourish reverse a half century trend
census_bureau statistic reveal that the country_'s urban population grow by 12.1 percent from 2000 to 2010 outpace the country_'s overall growth rate of 9.7 percent
mayors across america be welcome this new growth by champion restaurant gallery and museum
they be make their city safer build park and recreation facility and improve public school so that family stay rather_than head for the suburb like their parent
the success of our city also benefit our suburb as those community adopt successful urban housing policy like high density dwelling near train station and micro city environment that mirror urban living
so perhaps the headline should have read
as our city rise so do our suburbs
steven m. fulop mayor jersey city sept._15 2013
to the editor never have the case be make more strongly however inadvertently for the necessity of the two state_solution for the israeli palestinian conflict than in ian s. lustick_'s fantasy about the need to dump the idea two state illusion sunday_review sept._15
anyone_who care about the jewish people and take into account both the wonderful aspect as_well as the immense tragedy of jewish history must shudder at mr. lustick_'s willingness_to dismiss the existence of the first independent jewish state in 2,000 year
his argument about what will ensue after the abandonment of the goal of two state be a fancy version_of a one state_solution that end the concept of jewish self determination
the founding of the modern state of israel be a profound historical development
its safety and survival must be nurture and protect
yes the two state_solution be difficult to achieve but it be the only one that provide opportunity for palestinian self determination without abandon jewish sovereignty in the land of israel
mr. lustick_'s essay ultimately remind us of the need to get move toward that goal
while there be some in israel too who say there can be no two state_solution the leadership and vast_majority of its people see it as the only solution
unfortunately palestinians still have not make that leap primarily because_they like mr. lustick do_not place any value on a jewish state
indeed some may conclude_that give_up on two state may produce their old goal the disappearance of israel without war terrorism or boycott
kenneth jacobson deputy national director anti defamation league new_york sept._15 2013
to the editor ian s. lustick_'s essay offer an illogical unachievable agenda that do no favor either to israelis or palestinians
professor lustick_'s comparison of the israeli palestinian situation to effort by british colonialist to maintain control of ireland france 's colonial rule of algeria and communist rule in the soviet_union be off base
the point of the two state_solution be to end israel 's occupation of palestinian territory and to fulfill the palestinian right to self determination
likewise the notion that israelis whose family come from arab country would consider themselves arabs be absurd
they manage to preserve their jewish identity for 2,000 year in exile
why would they give it up now
in any case as israelis of european origin increasingly marry with the child and grandchild of family who come from arab land the distinction between the two be fast erode
the main problem with professor lustick_'s analysis be that it be a recipe for permanent conflict
both israelis and palestinians want_to fulfill their national aspiration in their_own country
neither will be satisfied with less and the two state_solution remain the only way to achieve that
alan elsner vice_president communications j street washington sept._15 2013 to the editor
have have my eye open by three visit to israel i find ian s. lustick_'s essay refreshingly clear and knowledgeable
even now the united_states turn a blind eye while israel continue expansion and brutal military tactic
i believe_that the whole point of decade of israeli encroachment onto fertile area of the west_bank and the imprisonment of palestinians in gaza have be to make a viable second state impossible
mr. lustick offer a realistic vision of the mideast today
janet jones san_francisco sept._15 2013 to the editor
although two state illusion argue against a two state_solution between israel and palestine most of the main historical analogy the writer cite demonstrate exactly the opposite outcome
in the case of ireland algeria and the soviet_union solution be create that allow two or more state to exist ireland and britain algeria and france the former soviet republic and russia
there be however one difference with the israel palestine case
none of the other national movement be bent on the ultimate annihilation of the other state with which they be in conflict
even illusion can be inspiring and highly adaptive when as in each of those historical example out of respect or simply self interest each party basically accept the right of the other to exist

state college pa. during the first week of class at penn_state last_month john nichols sit in his office in the old wing of the willard building across the lawn from old main fume about what people have be say for two_year now about the university he love
the campus be bustle
the student have return
this bucolic town 's main drag college avenue have come alive
store sell shirt that read billieve and o'brien 's lions
football season be close and almost everyone seem excited for coach bill o'brien 's second year
nichols sit behind his large wooden desk surround_by four full bookshelf
he have spend 36 year at penn_state
he raise his child here
he be a professor emeritus and a former chairman of the faculty senate
now he be talk_about jerry sandusky and joe paterno and he be get angry
he sit up straighter
his eye bulge
he throw his hand up
just this last_weekend i be with some of my close_friend in another state he say
of course the subject always come_up always come_up
it_' like a scarlet letter
and when i say that most of what you have read be not true they look_at you like even close_friend they look_at you like
be you a holocaust denier
you have drink the penn_state kool aid
what other conspiracy theory do you have
can you imagine the frustration when you_know that there_' be a gross mischaracterization of what have happen at penn_state
and that i and my kid who graduate_from penn_state my_friend and colleague here be go to have to live with be guilty for crime we do_not commit
nichols be among_those in the large penn_state community include current and former faculty alumnus and fan still upset at how the child sexual_abuse scandal involve sandusky paterno 's longtime top assistant be handle by the institution 's leadership
still upset about the report put forth by the former f.b.i. director louis j. freeh that say paterno and others cover up sandusky 's crime
still upset about the n.c.a.a. sanction base_on the report and what they say be the false narrative perpetuate by the news_medium
still upset about how they think the scandal come to define penn_state unfairly
terry engelder a professor of geosciences in his 28th year at penn_state say in an_e mail that some faculty_member be still agitated because the rush to unfair judgment have do unspeakable damage to the university 's reputation worldwide
the scandal continue to have ripple effect
the university 's board of trustee have authorize penn_state to spend about_$ 60 million to settle about 30 outstanding claim with sandusky 's victim
the former university president graham b. spanier the former athletic director tim curley and the former university vice_president gary schultz be set to stand trial for their suspect role in a cover up of sandusky 's action
sandusky be convict last_year of 45 count of child sexual_abuse and sentence to 30 to 60 year in prison
the football team be prohibit from play in a bowl game for three more season and it have scholarship restriction that run_through the 2017 season
nichols do_not want_to forget the scandal just yet
he say that the entire university have be implicate in the public 's mind that it have be accept as fact_that there be a cover up he say without due process
of the five man_who be most connect to the scandal nichols point_out only sandusky have be convict
paterno die last_year and spanier curley and schultz have yet to stand trial
if_they be find not guilty of the charge_against them include perjury conspiracy and endanger the welfare of child nichols say it would cast doubt on the legitimacy of the freeh report and the n.c.a.a. penalty would have no basis
i_think a_lot of people this include me be really root that they be find not guilty he say because that would start roll back the narrative
he sigh
we would like to think it would be duke 2 the duke lacrosse case where the truth would finally emerge he say
but i_think there_' a grow sense that that ' probably not go to happen
last_year the faculty senate appoint nichols to lead a study mean to complement the freeh report
the study examine the current state of the university and way to move_forward
his report be release in march 2013 to little fanfare
it conclude in part that more collaboration and better communication be need between the board of trustee and the rest of the university 1_2 next_page
on_sept. 9 a rag blaze in an abandon three story house in the bronx draw more_than a hundred firefighter take nearly three hour to bring under control and leave a charred structure in place of what have be an unloved neighborhood eyesore
that seem to be the end of the story
but on_monday a demolition crew clear the remains of the board up graffiti splotch house at 61 buchanan place find a dead body around 10_a.m.
a few_hour later they find two more
the new_york police_department say that all three of the victim their body severely burn their name and age unknown be man
fire and police official_say that it be not immediately_clear whether they have die in the fire though that appear to be the likely cause
official do_not say where in the house the body be find
how the three man may have come to be inside the derelict building appear less mysterious neighbor say the house have attract squatter for year
i_saw people go into the basement most of the time say shamsun khalique 59 who have live across the street for nearly 35_year
she_say she would see group of man often intoxicate come and go from the house which abut a large apartment_building on the short street on the edge of fordham heights
they be like live there miss khalique say
they use to bring this dog outside the basement
â
the building be also on the radar of local firefighter as potentially hazardous say frank dwyer a fire department spokesman
so when the fire break out around 4:30 a.m. and then grow firefighter battle it from the outside
when you_'re deal_with a vacant building board up with know hazard it_' dangerous anyway and now it_' on fire he say
you_'re not go to put member in danger if there_' no people know to be inside
it be unclear where the fire begin and fire marshal and police arson investigator have be examine its cause even before the body be discover
now those effort have be join by bronx detective
as for why the three body be not find immediately after the fire mr. dwyer say that fire investigator have enter the house after the blaze but have not go into every room because of structural damage
by 2034 the second avenue subway will wind through manhattan the metrocard will be long dead and few rider will remember an age without countdown clock
but to deliver new_york city to this gilded future of transit the metropolitan transportation authority will need a few thing
in a presentation on_monday at the authority 's headquarters in midtown official brief board_member on a 20-year $ 106 billion list to address core capital need stretch from 2015 to 2034
the full list a precursor to the authority 's 2015 19 capital plan be expect to be publish later this_month
the preview hint at the authority 's decision make at a critical moment in its operation ridership have climb to the point of overcrowding on some line sprawl megaprojects be approach their completion in the come year and part_of the system be still reel from hurricane_sandy
many of the possible investment be of a piece with priority discuss by thomas f. prendergast since his confirmation as the authority 's chairman in_june costly if unsexy improvement to age signal system and communication equipment
more_than a quarter of the $ 68.2 billion in estimate need for the authority 's new_york city transit division belong_to this category
about one fifth of the $ 68.2 billion be to replace subway car and bus
but some item make it clear that the authority have enter a new phase particularly when compare_with long_term plan from decade past as safety concern and unreliable service mean that merely stabilize the system be a chief goal say stephen a. berrang the authority 's director for capital program management
the authority 's list of emerge priority now include improved customer information like a systemwide network of countdown clock which be a focus of a presentation in_july on how to attract grow population of young rider to the transit system
the need assessment also call for a successor to the metrocard system which transit official_say can_not be maintain beyond 2019 and place an increase focus_on stormproofing since hurricane_sandy
mr. berrang say for_instance that the authority have raise resiliency standard on part_of the infrastructure like cable and power relay since the storm
and in what could be a welcome change for midtown commuter and tourist the authority have call for circulation improvement at the labyrinthine station in times_square and grand_central terminal
the authority say its current signal system allow 29 train per_hour to run on the lexington avenue line
but during many peak period only 26 run per_hour because crowding often keep train in station longer than expect
the authority 's plan to bring the long_island rail road into grand_central be expect to introduce additional strain
it create effectively a train traffic jam mr. berrang say of the current crowding
the authority say option include add staircase to improve passenger flow and add metrocard turnstile which if the agency have its way will be outdated in three to five_year
drill for shale_ga through hydraulic fracturing or fracking appear to cause small leak of the greenhouse_ga methane than the federal_government have estimate and considerably small than some critic of shale_ga have fear accord_to a peer review study release on_monday
the study conduct_by the university of texas and sponsor_by the environmental defense fund and nine petroleum company bolster the contention by advocate of fracking and some environmental_group as_well that shale_ga be clean and better_than coal at_least until more renewable energy source be develop
more_than 500 well be analyze
the texas study conclude_that while the total amount_of escape methane from shale_ga operation be substantial more_than one million ton annually it be probably less_than the environmental_protection agency estimate in_2011
in particular it indicate_that containment measure capture 99 percent of methane that escape from new well be prepare_for production a process know as completion
the environmental_protection agency have begin to require drillers to control leak during completion which be believe to be one of the major source of methane loss at fracking well
although control will not be require until january 2015 a number of company already capture escaped gas at well be prepare_for production
can we control it
thanks to new e.p.a. regulation come online the answer to that be good_news eric pooley a senior_vice president at the environmental defense fund say in an_interview
the report be publish monday in the proceeding of the national academy of sciences
with the study which run from may through december of last_year the university be the first to conduct detailed examination of individual drilling site
it do so with the consent of petroleum company which provide about 90_percent of the financing for the study
previous e.p.a. estimate rely_on engineering calculation and other study gather data via aircraft flight over drilling site
the study 's connection to the petroleum industry among its sponsor and financier be shell anadarko petroleum corporation exxon mobil and chevron may lead some to question its objectivity some outside expert say
but most say the research and the reputation of the researcher appear solid
previous study that have get a_lot of attention have have red_flag jump out all over them
this one do_n't say michael a. levi the director of the program on energy security and climate_change at the council on foreign_relations
in an_e mail statement shell 's president marvin odum call the study a prime example of key group that may not have the exact same interest work collaboratively and take a science base approach to the methane problem
mr. odum say that collect actual emission data rather_than rely_on estimate would ensure_that both improvement effort and regulatory change can be focus_on the area that will have the big impact
the report come at a time when shale_ga drilling be grow at a breakneck pace production now 30_percent of all united_states natural_ga be expect to reach 50_percent by 2040 but also when the industry be beset by controversy
citizen group accuse drillers of despoil stream and water supply and supplier of wreck local road with parade of massive truck
environmental_group have split sharply over whether to support shale_ga development as a clean fuel that will suffice until wind and solar power assume a great share of the nation_'s energy supply
the texas study be the most comprehensive look to date at a contentious issue in the debate_over fracking the extent to which methane leak during drilling and production offset the environmental benefit of the clean burn natural_ga the well produce
when burn as fuel methane the main component of natural_ga be comparatively clean produce less carbon_dioxide than coal and oil
but vent to the air it be a short live but extremely potent greenhouse_ga trap heat at a much high rate than carbon_dioxide the main greenhouse_ga
such potency mean that even a small loss of methane to the air just 3.4 percent scientist say can negate its climate_change advantage over coal
some previous study suggest_that as much as 7.9 percent of all shale_ga be lose to the atmosphere a figure that include every stage of the ga process from well to stove or furnace burner
the texas study do_not examine potential loss outside the drilling pad
but its conclusion that loss at the well be comparatively low could remove one issue from the debate
the environmental defense fund be lead other research effort that should address loss elsewhere include a look_at methane leak in municipal ga distribution line
the american petroleum institute hail the study 's conclusion say in a statement that its_own effort to reduce methane emission be pay off
but while e.p.a.-mandated measure appear to have reduce_emission during well completion the study also conclude_that leak elsewhere in the fracking process be high than the e.p.a. have previously estimate
estimate of leak from chemical pump while small be twice past estimate while leak from pneumatic controller or valve be peg at more_than 639,000 ton a year roughly a third great
none of those component be currently subject to federal regulation
maybe it be not that surprising that william c. thompson jr. would come_up just shy
it be not just that he pull in far few black and latino vote than his adviser have confidently predict for him in the recent democratic_primary for mayor
nor be it that he fall a few thousand vote short over all from force bill_de blasio into a runoff one in which he would have face long odds anyway
instead when mr._thompson abandon his quest on_monday in a disappointing coda to a campaign fill_with what ifs over everything from demographic to his message it present a microcosm of a dutiful but not_quite compelling career
whether he be the smart money pick as he be this_year or the underdog as he be when he lose to mayor_michael r._bloomberg in_2009 mr._thompson could never_quite concoct the right recipe to parlay his two term as a steady new_york city comptroller into something grand
a product of brooklyn machine politics mr._thompson believe strongly in by the book tactic like gather institutional endorsement
yet he never lead in a single poll
he never surge or collapse unlike some of his rival
and despite campaigning for 24_hour straight not once but twice in the past six_week the mild mannered mr._thompson could never convince voter that he have enough political thunder
he be a very smart very talented public servant who have do everything people would want him to do but it always seem_like it_' not enough say basil a. smikle jr. a democratic consultant who teach at_columbia university and the city university of new_york
even on the eve_of the primary mr._thompson struggle to connect with voter who should have be in his column
at a deli on flatbush avenue in brooklyn he have just utter a quick hello and remind people about election day when stephon zephyr say excuse me big guy you run for mayor
mr._thompson surprised say yes
then in barely audible tone he talk to mr. zephyr a 26-year old plumber for five_minute about job and gun_violence
after mr._thompson leave mr. zephyr shrug
he sound good but he do_not say much
he just brush me off
on paper mr._thompson enter the campaign with many advantage
he have win the admiration of democrats for come closer than expect to unseat mr._bloomberg four_year ago
and in a city where minority be now the majority mr._thompson the son and namesake of a respected judge and former legislator stand_out as the only black candidate with a long resume in both the public and private_sector
count on demographic to give him an edge mr._thompson amass an impressive list of endorsement party stalwart like fernando ferrer fiscal watchdog
richard ravitch black pastor who have back mr._bloomberg in_2009 former representative floyd h. flake and key union the united federation of teachers
one of his big fund_raiser be former_senator alfonse m. d'amato the republican power broker
together they argue_that mr._thompson who at 60 be the old major democratic contender have the best experience and the temperament to govern
but his establishment friendly strategy have blind_spot accord_to more_than a dozen people both affiliate with and independent of the campaign
billy thompson be as decent a man as you will find in new_york city politics say neal kwatra a democratic consultant who do_not work for any mayoral candidate
but billy and his team be captive of a bygone era of coalition and identity politics
foremost be the assumption that people have cast a pro thompson vote in_2009 rather_than an anti bloomberg one
nor do mr._thompson take seriously the theory that mr._bloomberg 's margin may have be diminish because some of his supporter anticipate a blowout do_not bother to vote
those assumption may have give mr._thompson a false sense of security even as he fade from public view for three_year
he show up think well now it_' my turn because you guy like me you really like me,'â say christina greer a political science professor_at fordham
but a_lot of new_yorkers seem to say i can_not remember who you are.'â
another problem be that mr._thompson never articulate a clear message
muddled be a word use by many
he develop a centrist platform better suit to a general_election than a democratic_primary oppose tax increase while mr._de blasio hammer away at income inequality
his thread the needle position on the stop and frisk police tactic in particular exasperate many minority and liberal

san_francisco with emirates team new_zealand hold a huge lead head into the final stage of the america_'s cup it remain_unclear just what the team will do with the competition if it go on to defeat oracle_team usa. will race be in multihulls again or in monohulls
in big boat again or in small boat
close to the shore again or back in the heart of auckland 's vast hauraki gulf
but grant dalton the combative managing director of team new_zealand have make two thing clear
he want the cost of compete in the next edition of the cup to be considerably less expensive in order to attract more team
he also want_to restore a nationality rule
the nationality debate have long be contentious in the cup
for now hull must be manufacture in the nation of the challenging yacht club but there be no nationality restriction on sailor involve
that be why oracle which represent san_francisco 's golden gate yacht club and the united_states can compete_with just one american rome kirby on its 11-man crew which feature sailor of seven nationality in sunday 's race
this be in keep with the owner larry ellison 's global approach to talent recruitment and with the prevail recent view that america_'s cup team be close in spirit to motor racing 's
formula_one team more about brand identity and push technological boundary than about national identity and a patriotic agenda
i_love america and i_love to say that my family be american say james spithill oracle 's australian helmsman and skipper who be married to an american
spithill add but i tell you what i be not go to try_to hide from the fact_that we have different nationality in our team because i be proud of every one of them and the idea and creativity they bring
dalton and team new_zealand have a different vision
nine of their start crew_member be new zealanders the other two be australians with strong new_zealand connection
it_' a very homogeneous crew while ellison ' get an international free agency crew say gary jobson the american who win the 1977 america_'s cup as tactician to ted turner and be now a television analyst
i strongly believe_that the america_'s cup deed of gift be write as a friendly competition between foreign country and i_think the american boat should have all americans the new_zealand boat ought to have all kiwis and the french boat should have all french
and if_you do that i_think the america_'s cup would mean a_lot more to a_lot of people
new_zealand with a population of about 4.4 million have long punch well above its demographic weight in the sailing world
new zealanders have be fixture on nearly all the major team in the past four cup cycle
oracle also have a strong kiwi influence
russell coutts the team 's chief_executive and former skipper be a new zealander
the imposition of nationality restriction would presumably cost kiwis some sail job as_well
but dalton say he be convince that the event need to tack away_from the billionaire versus billionaire approach that have be back in vogue in the last decade
we stand for a strong nationality rule he say earlier_this year in an occasionally testy onstage debate with coutts in new_zealand
the question be how strong a rule
fulfil jobson 's vision and create full olympic style national_team would probably discourage team from emerge sail nation like china and south_korea
their home country sailor simply could_not be competitive against the establish power
grant dalton 's idea from what i understand after talk to him would be to have a weak nationality rule for newcomer for new country which seem fair say bruno trouble a french former america_'s cup helmsman
but establish team could also struggle with a new rule
artemis racing which represent the royal swedish yacht club have no swedish sailor on its primary crew during this_year 's challenger series 1_2 next_page

woman or nothing the new comedy by the filmmaker ethan coen feel_like a short play that have be heavily pad
perhaps this should not be a surprise mr. coen have write several one act but this be his first full length stage work
somewhere inside this bloated comedy about two lesbian in search of some viable sperm there may be a skinny sex farce struggle to break free
be that too_much information for an opening paragraph
the word sperm can be a little startling over morning coffee or for that matter an evening cocktail
sorry about that but the play which open on_monday at the atlantic theater company in a production direct_by david cromer rest entirely on the lead character improbable quest for this substance
soon_after the light go up on an enviably chic new_york apartment we find gretchen halley feiffer bustle around the shelf stock with art book and expensive look gewgaw remove select photograph and tuck them away in a closet
when her partner laura susan pourfar arrive home they have a slightly tense argument about the plan gretchen have hatch to help them have a baby
scorn the anonymity of sperm bank and the potential lack of rigor involve in their screening process gretchen have decide to recruit a viable donor herself
the twist be he ' be volunteer involuntarily the colleague she ' deem genetically desirable for their purpose wo_not know that he ' be use
this do_not sit well with laura a concert pianist with a rather more stringent ethical sense than gretchen who be a lawyer
what be it that make us human
laura loftily ask
ms. pourfar employ a rather grand sound accent
it_' know_what we_'re do choose what_we 're do
gretchen play by ms. feiffer with perky energy breezily dismiss her qualm and continue prepare to set the trap she ' lay although since only laura can conceive she ' the one who will be do the seduce over a casual dinner
gretchen plan to run late and then call to cancel
mr. coen elicit some bite humor from their gentle tussle over the subject as when laura learn that the donor have be select in part_because he happen to be move to florida soon
i would not sleep with a normal man laura say
how could i sleep with a man_who want_to live in florida
their long scene of tart exchange about the merit of sperm bank versus room service as laura call it lead to gradual rapprochement
unfortunately this talky scene also leave the audience with lot_of time to ponder the absurdity of their enterprise
laura may be resign to her role but we on the other side of the proverbial footlights may still have some reservation
be the woman so unaware of the physiology of insemination that they imagine that a single encounter with a man will necessarily achieve the desire result
this be particularly germane give laura 's age 40
since laura have never sleep with a man she ' a gold star lesbian she_say later do she make a likely one shot man trap
in any case man_who sleep around be likely_to ponder potential consequence when they be contemplate sex
at no point do anyone mention the possibility of their guinea pig 's request a condom
and many lesbian couple who be also wary of sperm bank choose a good friend to donate in a less intimate and less chancey manner an option that go unmentioned here
willing suspension of disbelief be of course often a prerequisite at the theater
but when the superstructure of the plot be found on a notion as rickety as the one drive woman or nothing it_' hard not to feel disengage
my objection be hardly put to rest when the donor himself arrive in the play 's second scene
the lanky handsome but bookish look chuck robert beitzel hardly seem the kind_of heedless priapic guy who would chase any skirt
the nervous laura begin down cocktail and ply chuck with same but their conversation be high minded laura 's cynicism about her career i_'m a brand name now she_say i_'m burma shave be counter by chuck 's assertion that her art no_doubt touch an audience
soon they be find common ground in meander talk of manner and moral but the comic potential in this unlikely seduction go unrealized

the history of baseball be full of famous collapse that enable team to qualify_for the playoff against all expectation
the 1978 red_sox the 1964 phillies and the 2007 mets be but a few whose collapse pave the way for more fortunate team
but if the yankees be to earn one of the two american_league wild_card spot it will_probably require one of baseball 's great multiteam collapse
but as alex_rodriguez say after sunday 's ugly 9 2 loss to boston you never know crazy thing have happen
the final two week of the regular_season would have to be particularly crazy for thing to break the yankees way
as of monday morning there be six team with a chance at the two wild_card spot and myriad circumstance to get two of those team into the playoff
a week_ago the yankees be in position to control their_own fate
in fact they do by lose
after be sweep by the red_sox this past weekend the yankees could still miss the playoff even_if they win the rest of their game
but their playoff hop remain alive
the only thing we can do be go out and play and win the game that we be in c. c. sabathia say
obviously we_need a little help
but if we do_not win that help wo_not even matter
we_need to win most of the rest of the game we be play and then see what_happen
the yankees who be off monday have 12 game leave
they be 79 71 and be three game_behind the tampa_bay rays and the texas_rangers the leader in the a.l. wild_card race enter monday 's game
the rangers visit the rays on_monday to begin a four game series
the cleveland indians begin a three game series at kansas_city
the outcome of that series be also important because the indians be two and a half_game ahead of the yankees and the royals be a half_game behind them
i know we be right in the mix rodriguez say
it_' nothing that a two- or three game winning streak can_not fix
if we go out and win four of the next five start tuesday i_think we be right back in this thing
if_you take boston away over the last two or three week we have play pretty_good baseball
the orioles be a half_game ahead of the yankees but they have the unenviable task of play the red_sox six more time
if the rays win three of the four game_against texas this_week and the yankees sweep the blue_jays which will not be easy because the blue_jays have r. a. dickey pitch tuesday the yankees will be one game_behind texas in the loss column and three behind the ray
but they have three game leave against the rays at yankee_stadium
the indians have be play well recently but the struggle of the rangers and the rays have give the yankees reason to believe even after their dismal showing in boston
i do_not stop believe manager joe_girardi say
we_'re not the only team that ' run into hard time in the month of september and august
there_' other team that have run into hard time too
we still have a great opportunity
yeah we have to win a_lot of game but the opportunity be in front of us
the rangers go into monday 's game have lose 6 straight and 9 of their previous 10
the rays have lose 14 of their previous 21 game
the yankees on the other_hand have just complete the hard part_of their schedule against the red_sox
they have three more at toronto and then three at home against the san_francisco giants and three against the rays before they head to houston for three against the astros who have the bad record in baseball
every_day be a new opportunity for us say phil hughes who be back in the rotation and schedule to pitch wednesday in toronto
i_feel good about it
i_feel like the schedule could work in our favor provide we win
right_now there_' a_lot of team that have their eye on the wild_card
it_' a dogfight
the report make for chilling reading
the finding be beyond doubt and beyond the pale
this be a war_crime

there be liberty gold coin and krugerrands and a gold chain so thick that have it be use as a restraining device it may have do a fair job of keep tom eli behind bar
but the purpose of the gold bauble chain include be exactly the opposite mr. eli 's romany family seek to use them as collateral for his $ 50,000 bail to secure his release from rikers island
and therein lay the reason for an_unusual hearing on_monday at state supreme_court in manhattan as prosecutor seek to challenge the provenance of the jewelry
mr. eli 's lawyer grow indignant that his client have to spend another night on rikers simply because the judge be not convinced that the man 's family have obtain the pile of gold lawfully
with the defendant 's mother a 72-year old retired carnival worker and part time palm reader still sit in the witness box the judge firmly remind the lawyer that a prior associate of the defendant 's show up with $ 50,000 in cash to cover the bail but change his mind when he learn that there would be such a hearing
poof he disappear say the judge charles h. solomon
so something ' fishy obviously
that certainly make me suspicious
prosecutor say mr. eli 41 slash a man outside 230 fifth a nightclub in the flatiron district on april 14
mr. eli 's lawyer thomas a. kenniff wag an anthropological argument
after century of be chase from country to country the roma sometimes call gypsies have develop an aversion to traditional institution include bank and have their_own internal economy
he say he fear that his client be be treat differently from similarly situate people because of his background
mr. kenniff call to the stand dr. ruth andersen who have study the romany people since the 1970 and say that many who_live in the united_states still follow ancient tradition include pass down gold coin and necklace as heirloom and own those piece communally
their gold be heirloom gold dr. andersen say
if someone be desperate and have to sell the gold for money they would be heartbroken
there be many romany people_who would sooner starve
next come the defendant 's mother lulu eli costello who testify that she have obtain the jewelry from various relative at her wedding in 1962 and from the in law of her_son when they marry through the year
i hold on to them like security she_say
she_say she be bear in jasper tex
and then move around a_lot
she begin work at fair and carnival in game and concession when she marry
we use to cover a_lot of state all over she_say
every week be in a different spot
but the prosecutor in the case michael pasinkoff seek to characterize the family as less_than trustworthy
he ask mrs. costello about the arrest of several member of her family reach all the way back to her_father 's arrest on attempt murder charge in 1972 and also mention that the son in jail have a violent felony conviction
mr. pasinkoff then show mrs. costello a legal complaint he say she sign against her granddaughter five_year ago accuse the young_woman of steal $ 30,000 in jewelry from her
ms. costello say she do_not recognize the complaint
i do_not know_what it be and i do_not know where it come from she_say
my granddaughter be a very_good girl
frankfurt the real political drama in germany this_year may get under_way only after chancellor_angela merkel face the voter
as state election in bavaria underline on_sunday ms._merkel 's personal popularity conceal a high degree of political fragmentation
that could make it tricky for her to assemble a govern coalition especially if her center right christian democratic_party perform the way poll suggest win this sunday 's national election but fall_short of an outright majority
her current coalition partner the free democratic_party do so poorly in the bavarian election that it may emerge_from the national vote with no seat
that could force ms._merkel who be seek a third_term to make a power sharing deal_with the main opposition_party the more left lean social_democrats
meanwhile pop_up party notably the anti euro alternative for germany have occupy political space vacate by ms._merkel as she move leave on issue like a national minimum_wage and nuclear_power
the situation underline the major_role that small party can play in german politics and the grow willingness of german voter to switch from one party to another
it use to be that 30_percent of the voter would vote for the christian_democrats no_matter what the party say or do say stephan werhahn a grandson of konrad adenauer the country_'s first postwar chancellor
today the voter orient themselves accord_to their personal interest say mr. werhahn a munich lawyer who himself defect from the christian_democrats to a minor party last_year but then return this_year
the party have have to take_over more issue that be not in harmony with their basic principle in order to attract these voter german politics be still much_more orderly than in some other european country like italy and greece
still germany_'s level of voter unrest be puzzle give that the country have not suffer nearly as much from the euro crisis
unemployment here be near record_low
the situation in germany be still very_different from italy or greece which be really under strain say thomas harjes chief_economist at barclays germany
he say some voter may feel a sense of powerlessness in the face of global force that breed disillusion with mainstream party
no party have feel the new fickleness of voter more acutely than the pro business free_democrats long a fixture in the country_'s postwar politics
just four_year after win almost 15_percent in the national vote they be at risk of fall_short of the 5_percent need to field a delegation to the national parliament
if_they do fail ms._merkel may need to form a so_call grand_coalition with the social_democrats
she could then have to balance their leave lean demand with the right_wing of her_own party which be already grumpy about her support for euro_zone bailouts even as citizen of receive country have excoriate her insistence on austerity
some of her disgruntled party member have even defect to alternative for germany
one be karl georg glehn a lawyer from cologne who be one of several_hundred people in frankfurt on_saturday to attend an alternative rally in front of city_hall
we_'re liable for billion from the greek economy which be bankrupt cronyistic and corrupt he say
they would be better off with their_own currency
merkel be silent on all_these problem
alternative for germany be the wild_card in sunday 's election
it field no candidate in bavaria but its voter be regard as highly commit and likely_to vote and poll show the party could come close to win enough vote nationally to get seat in parliament
i have a feeling there be an undercurrent of sympathy that be be underestimate say christian meurer a political satirist and author of a recent book the wackos who be govern us die irren die uns regieren
seat in parliament would give the alternative party a soapbox in berlin and allow it to play a disruptive role in debate about european policy while make it hard for ms._merkel to muster a majority
the headline these debate will generate will be very harmful say mr. harjes the economist
ms._merkel will also have to contend with the christian_democrats sister party the christian social union in bavaria which be feel its oat after a commanding victory last_sunday
the party which normally do_not field candidate outside bavaria win enough vote to form a state government by itself
predominantly roman_catholic it be more conservative on many issue than the christian_democrats and will_probably demand a substantial number of cabinet post as payment for bavaria 's support in parliament
in a sense the free_democrats unexpectedly strong showing nationally four_year ago when they win 14.6 percent wind up contribute to their steep decline
despite hold several cabinet post they be unable_to deliver promise tax overhaul ms._merkel prefer to focus_on cut debt
and free democrat leader fight among themselves
it be our own fault say jã¶rg uwe hahn the minister of justice in the state of hessen who be also a member of the free_democrats national govern body
on the core issue tax the party do_not deliver quickly and decisively enough
mr. hahn say though that he be optimistic the free_democrats would win the 5_percent of the national vote need to get into parliament
when the party have be in trouble in the past christian_democrats often cross over to make_sure it could be a coalition partner
karl heinz paque an_economist who be formerly leader of the free democrat delegation in the saxony anhalt state parliament say it be inconceivable that the party would be exclude from national politics
the f.d.p. be part_of german history he say

moore who score the rangers goal monday skip all of last_season after his_wife katie die last january from liver cancer
moore last play for san jose at the end of the 2011 12 season after he be trade from tampa_bay late that season
you_'re a little_bit unsure because you have not play in so long moore say add i_feel good i_feel strong i_feel fast
the timing will come

the rangers trade him in_july 2006 to nashville which immediately ship him to pittsburgh
after 59 game with the penguins moore be trade to minnesota and later skate for toronto buffalo florida montreal tampa_bay and san jose
he be a valuable playoff performer for the canadiens in_2010 and the lightning in_2011 as both team reach the eastern conference final
moore recall his first training_camp with the rangers 13 year_ago when he cross path with adam graves who be play his final_season
i remember how adam come around and talk to all the young guy tap on our shin pad and tell_us we be do a great job moore say
that kind_of support be tremendous and i hope i can help the young_player here now as a veteran

you_can not say enough about his dedication work ethic and the quality person he be say graves who be in charge of hockey and business operation for the rangers
he ' the type_of player everyone can learn from
moore say he be particularly look_forward to reunite with the all_star goaltender henrik lundqvist a fellow rangers rookie in 2005 6
obviously those be special time when you be first break in say moore who center a line with the youngster brandon mashinter on left wing and shawn o'donnell on the right against the devils
that year we show what ' possible when a team be on the same page
i_feel we can have the same potential this_season
florham park n.j. dee milliner make a few mental miscue and his coach infuriate yank him from the game
this occur thursday_night against the patriots
it also happen three_year ago in milliner 's freshman season at alabama
they be simple mistake then he say just as they be in the first_half of the jets 13 10 loss to new_england
milliner rebound to earn a cornerback spot on the southeastern conference 's all freshman team
he have 14 game to make a similar recovery with the jets but his immediate future be uncertain
milliner seem to understand his current predicament why coach rex ryan remain noncommittal on whether milliner will regain his start role for sunday 's game_against buffalo
you_know you_'re go to go_through struggle no_matter if_you 're young or whatever you be milliner say
so you have just get to get through it
as a freshman at alabama milliner do in large_part because injury and graduation gutted the crimson tide 's secondary require him to learn on the job
the jets after draft him ninth over all believe in his potential but as ryan say monday we_'ve get to do what ' best for us
if milliner do_not start on_sunday he be still likely_to play
but any reduction in playing time could be view as an acknowledgment that he be not ready to assume the responsibility that the jets heap on him
despite miss their off_season program because of shoulder surgery three day of full squad workout after stag a weeklong holdout from training_camp and the final two preseason_game because of injury milliner be list atop their first depth chart ahead of kyle wilson who draw raf from ryan throughout the off_season
we be comfortable with him physically there be no question we be ryan say of milliner
now do he miss a_lot of time
he absolutely do
we think he could handle it
but again it_' not that i be totally
oh hey he ' fail
that ' not the case
we have to correct a few thing
milliner struggle in the season opener against tampa_bay show a lack of awareness on a 17-yard touchdown catch by mike williams
precisely what cause his benching against new_england remain_unclear but he appear to be at fault during the broken coverage that yield aaron dobson 's 39-yard touchdown reception and he benefit_from video replay overrule a touchdown by kenbrell thompkins
milliner hint that he be aware of the in game adjustment he should have make but be just slow to react
the jets draft milliner because of his physical attribute and cover skill
milliner say the most challenging aspect_of his transition to the n.f.l. have be the mental adjustment analyze receiver tendency learn the nuance of coverage scheme
he say film review have be valuable help him form a picture of what he do wrong so that he will not make the same mistake twice
it work for him at alabama he say and so he hop it will again
i_'ve just get to move fast and be alert
milliner say
smith 's option to run
it be not that the jets necessarily want geno smith to run more but they do want him to recognize run opportunity when they arise
bemoan his fourth_quarter interception at the patriots 11 which cost the jets a chance to at_least tie the score smith say monday that on the play a third and-4 he should have rush for the first down instead of try_to squeeze the ball to santonio holmes in a tight space
in those time if need be i have get to tuck the ball down and run smith say
after lead the jets with 47 rush yard against tampa_bay smith run three time for 17 yard against new_england include a 16-yard third_quarter scamper on second and-13
run be not smith 's default setting he consider himself a pocket passer with mobility look to throw downfield and then react if his option be cover
rex ryan say if it_' take away_from you then it_' not a bad deal to take off with it
injured be return for a team that play twice in five day the jet be remarkably healthy
and they be optimistic that defensive lineman muhammad wilkerson right ankle sprain a linchpin of their defensive front and receiver jeremy kerley concussion will be available sunday against buffalo
both return to practice monday as do outside linebacker quinton coples who have ankle surgery a month_ago
wilkerson who hurt his ankle in the fourth_quarter against new_england walk_around the locker_room without_any wrap or bandage on his ankle
just a little soreness he say
the jets miss kerley against new_england as their receiver drop four pass
he must complete the league 's concussion protocol before be clear to play but he say he do_not foresee that as an obstacle
i_'ll take_care of myself kerley say
i do_not want_to pay for it later down the road
new punter

it be a new frontier of the anti abortion movement law ban abortion at 20 week after conception contend that fetus can feel_pain then
since_2010 a dozen state have enact them most_recently texas
nationally a bill pass the republican dominate house of representatives in_june
the science of fetal_pain be highly complex
most scientist who have express view on the issue have say they believe_that if fetus can feel_pain the neurological wiring be not in place until later after the time when nearly all abortion occur
several scientist have do research that abortion opponent say show that fetus can feel_pain at 20 week after conception
one of those scientist say he believe fetus could likely feel_pain then but he_add that he believe the few abortion perform then could be do in way to avoid pain
he and two other scientist say they do_not think their work or current evidence provide scientific support for fetal_pain law
some scientist view have evolve as more research have be do
dr. nicholas fisk a senior maternal fetal medicine specialist at royal brisbane and women_'s hospital in australia say he once consider early fetal_pain a major possibility after find that fetus receive blood transfusion produce increase stress hormone and blood flow to the brain and that painkiller lower those level
but dr. fisk a former_president of the international fetal medicine and surgery society say neurological research have convince him that pain be not possible at all before 24 week
supporter of fetal_pain law also say that surgeon use of anesthesia and painkiller when operate on fetus in the womb prove fetus feel_pain
if the child who be wait for surgery can feel_pain the child who be wait for abortion can also feel_pain say mary spaulding balch the national right to life committee 's state policy director who pioneer fetal_pain law
she do_not advocate perform abortion with anesthesia or painkiller to have a painless death but rather want those abortion prevent because a member of the human family have reach a point where they be capable of feel_pain
but fetal surgeon say that the drug be give for reason other than fetal_pain
anesthesia be give to the mother reach the fetus say dr. scott adzick a fetal surgeon at children_'s hospital of philadelphia
fetus receive muscle relaxant and narcotic
the drug be give to prevent maternal pain immobilize the fetus relax the uterus and block harmful effect of a fetus 's hormonal stress response he say
ask_if fetus would feel_pain without these drug dr. adzick say he do_not know
dr. mark rosen who pioneer anesthesia in fetal surgery say if fetus could experience surgery relate pain it would be postoperatively because during surgery anesthesia from the mother be so strong
painkiller give to fetus would prevent postsurgical pain if it exist but the know scientific reason for them be it promote healing he say
the fetus be go to go on and develop and live
fetal_pain law usually prohibit abortion at 20 week after conception about 22 week gestational age as measure by scientist from the last menstrual period since conception can_not be pinpoint
by far most abortion occur before 24 week because the supreme_court have saidâ they may be perform until fetus can be viable outside the womb which doctor say be around 24 week
so the law ban abortion about two week before the 24-week threshold affect very few 98.5 percent of abortion occur before 21 week accord_to the guttmacher institute a research group that support abortion right
later case often involve just discover birth defect
still both_side consider the law which have be challenge and block in arizona georgia and idaho broad effort to narrow abortion option and build opposition
scientist with vary view of pain development say they do_not consider their work applicable to fetal_pain law or the highly charge abortion debate
for_example one of the main scientist whose work be cite as support for the law be dr. kanwaljeet anand a professor of pediatrics anesthesiology and neurobiology at the university of tennessee 's health science center
dr. anand say he consider fetal_pain likely at 18 to 24 week
but he_add that the issue of fetal_pain do_not have much relevance for abortion since most abortion be perform before the fetus be capable of experience pain and that for the very few abortion that occur after that time technique could be use that he believe would prevent pain
because so_much about pain be undetermined most scientific discussion eventually run into theoretical territory
much research involve child or adult make implication for fetus unclear
scientist say characterize response as pain be difficult some fetal reaction be simply reflex or stress hormone
some researcher say pain sense ability depend_on consciousness which may itself emerge gradually 1_2 next_page

family parade infant on their shoulder brigade of woman march together and neighbor smile and wave from window
any who disapprove hold their tongue aware they be outnumber
the security_force seldom venture beyond a tight ring of barbed wire and armored vehicle protect the provincial headquarters
during a recent weekday evening protest a lone police car wait patiently at an intersection for a parade of morsi supporter several block long to make its way past
keep hop president sisi be a good donkey they chant a play on the general 's last name which be the arabic word for pony
this coup be not go to last for long because it be commit suicide

birmingham ala. glenn fleisig 's rather unusual laboratory have a pitcher 's mound and a home plate and when he rig people up to throw a baseball their motion be analyze with sensor feed into computer
nearby be a second lab and that be where fleisig the research director at the american sports medicine institute keep the body part dead shoulder elbow and knee
these appendage sever from cadaver can be stretch until the ligament and tendon be stress enough to snap
fleisig a biomedical engineer know_what an arm can handle and year of research give him the confidence to answer one of baseball 's more intriguing question be there a limit to how fast a human being can throw
his answer yes there be
and he_add that limit already have be reach
oh there may be an outlier one exception here or there he say
but for major_league baseball pitcher as a group of elite the top be not go to go up anymore
with better conditioning and nutrition and mechanic more pitcher will be toward that top throw at 95 or 100
but the top have top out
so 110 will not become the new 100
fleisig attribute this conclusion to the frailty of ligament and tendon already stretch to the limit by the pitching motion the final whip of which he call the fastest know human movement
when you ask about performance and velocity i end_up talk_about medicine and injury he say
you_can not strengthen tendon and ligament per se certainly not as much as muscle
the muscle overwhelm them
and then come that snap
velocity itself be a risk factor for injury he say
mets pitcher matt harvey be the late unfortunate example to confirm fleisig 's research
harvey a 24-year old who be among the hardest throw starter in baseball learn aug. 26 that he have a partial ligament tear in his right elbow
on_monday harvey meet with dr. james andrews the orthopedic surgeon who be the medical director of the institute
whether harvey opt to have surgery that would sideline him for a year a decision most_likely to be make in come day will depend to a considerable degree on what andrews recommend
and whatever decision be make it seem clear that harvey have_already come_up against his body 's own speed limit
those inherent human limit may be bad_news for those_who believe record be make to be break that the fast inevitably cedes to the fast
on the other_hand no_one really know the record for the fast pitch ever throw
baseball may have a grand history support by well keep statistic but pitch velocity have not be a mark easy to assess perhaps until_now
in 2007 major_league baseball begin widespread use of the pitch f/x system from the company sportvision in conjunction with mlb advanced media by 2008
the system have be instal in all 30 major_league ballpark
track software now follow the trajectory of each pitch calculate its position and velocity along the way
the speed reading be not_entirely reliable until 2008 accord_to graham goldbeck sportvision 's manager of data analytics and operation
but since_then he say it be a very accurate speedometer
the fast pitch record by the system be 105.1 mile_per hour
it be throw by cincinnati reds reliever aroldis chapman on_sept. 24 2010 during an at bat by tony gwynn jr. of the san_diego padres
the pitch be call a ball level the count at 2 2
i do_not see it until the ball be behind me gwynn say
in fact chapman have throw 17 of the 20 fast pitch record by pitch f/x since 2008 accord_to goldbeck
four of those heater come during gwynn 's seven pitch at bat which end in a strikeout
two others be throw by chapman that same night against other padres
of course the question of who ' the fast pitcher ever will draw different response from great grandpa grandpa dad and junior
likely name surface in the conversation would include walter johnson bob feller satchel paige nolan ryan randy johnson billy wagner and for real aficionado steve dalkowski 1

by the time mr._kerry 's plane land back in washington the ground have shift and on_saturday not a week later mr._kerry and mr._lavrov complete the plan sit by the pool at a geneva hotel
it be a pact that american arm control expert have scramble to shape and that the white_house believe may be the best way to the uphold prohibition against the use of poison_ga without resort to military force
but it be also one that the kremlin clearly think serve the interest of russia and the syrian_government
in many way mr._lavrov 's work over the next six day represent the apex of a career largely spend try_to body block what the kremlin have long view as dangerous american unilateralism
it be a job he have do so effectively that it have earn him the nickname minister nyet and senior american_official include hillary_rodham clinton and condoleezza rice have say they often find it infuriate to deal_with him
as the diplomatic technician for his bos president_vladimir v._putin mr._lavrov maneuver to hem in the united_states avert a unilateral military_strike and reassert russia 's role all while russia be continue to provide weapon to mr._assad and diplomatic cover for his effort to suppress an uprising
more broadly though mr._lavrov have seek to force the united_states into a conversation that the kremlin hope will set a precedent establish russia 's role in world affair base not on the date cold_war paradigm but rather on its_own outlook which favor state sovereignty and status_quo stability over the spread of western style democracy
in do so mr._lavrov rely_on his long experience not just on nearly 10_year as foreign_minister
he serve more_than a decade as russia 's ambassador to the united_nations where he develop an intricate knowledge of the working of the security_council as_well as deep experience in international disarmament effort include in iraq
for now he ' one of the most skilled diplomat in the world say fyodor lukyanov editor in chief of the policy journal russia in global affairs

for mr._lavrov it be a series of event he have long prepare_for
he graduate_from the moscow state institute of international relations in 1972 and move to new_york in 1981 to work at the united_nations after brief stint in sri lanka and in moscow
at the united_nations he be know for his elaborate seemingly absent minded doodling during lengthy meeting but also for a command of the issue
he be a great doodler but his mind be always spin away say charles a. duelfer who be deputy head of the united_nations weapon inspector program in iraq in the 1990 and frequently meet with mr._lavrov at the united_nations headquarters in new_york
mr. duelfer say that mr._lavrov 's long experience with united_nations inspector work to remove unconventional arm from iraq help him to quickly assess the situation in syria and to work out a detail plan with mr._kerry
he know this stuff because he live through it in iraq mr. duelfer say
he ' know_what ' possible when you have independent inspector
a more cynical view analyst and western diplomat say be that mr._lavrov be after a political objective not one of disarmament use diplomatic jujitsu to buy time for the assad_regime 1_2 next_page

giglio italy salvage worker right the scar and discolor hull of the cruise_ship costa concordia early tuesday after coax it from two granite reef it run aground on just off this tiny tourist island 20 month_ago kill 32 people
as the vast hull slowly emerge during the complex 19-hour salvage operation the full extent of damage to the vessel become apparent
it look as if a giant fist have drive into the ship 's flank
ship horn blare over giglio 's tiny port to celebrate the moment and some of the island 's 1,500 resident hug salvage worker as they come ashore from what be likely_to be see as a bold step toward redress some of italy 's anguish after the costa concordia the length of three football field careen into the reef on a wintry night in_january 2012
this be an_important visible step franco gabrielli head of italy 's civil protection_agency tell_reporter at 4 a.m. accompany_by applause from a few resident who have stay up all night to follow the operation
he be echo by franco porcellacchia project manager for costa cruises the ship 's operator
there be no_evidence so_far of any impact to the environment he say
if there be debris to be remove we will do it tomorrow
on_tuesday morning at a crowded news_conference on giglio port italian official seem almost surprised by how precisely their calculation have work but express caution about future step to secure the vessel before it can be tow away and scrap probably in the spring
the phase to come will be just as complicated mr. porcellacchia say
nick sloane the salvage master say the operation exceed his expectation
it be nice to see that at 4 a.m. he tell_reporter tuesday afternoon
mr. sloane explain that a full survey of the damage which he call substantial would be possible only after italian authorities carry_out their inspection and search_for the body of two people aboard the ship who be still miss
the operation leave the 951-foot ship rest on an artificial platform 90 foot below the surface with only about a third of its once sleek white line visible above water
engineer say the badly damaged starboard side would need to be weld and reinforce so that other steel chamber know as caisson and crucial to the operation to right the ship can be attach
the vessel will also need to be further secure to withstand winter weather engineer say
we will consider the operation conclude once the ship leave giglio island mr. gabrielli tell_reporter acknowledge_that risk remain while the wreck be at sea
we 'll carry_out all the need intervention to mitigate it and allow the ship to face the next winter in secure condition he say
mr. sloane say he could hear worker jump around with relief and delight as the ship be gently lay on the platform
it be like a roller coaster he say
the righting of the vessel do_not draw universal applause
i do_not necessarily think that this be a great victory for italy maybe for the italian and american company involve say suzanne kmetyko 50 a tourist from austria who have visit the island for the past seven_year
and the real success for the island will come only once people around the world will stop remember it for the shipwreck rather_than for its natural beauty she_say
a long_way to go
italian news_medium by_contrast portray the salvage broadcast live on television and the internet as a chance for the country to revamp its image after the wreck in which the captain flee the damage ship and the evacuation be chaotic
the lead national daily corriere della sera call the shipwreck a monument to human stupidity and a humiliation for italy
it say it hop that the salvage effort would provide a new and different story for the country
it be not always clear what that story would be
as part_of the concordia emerge in the late afternoon on_monday stained and rusting from the water where the vessel have languish engineer have say the operation would most_likely take long than initially plan
the sheer size of the concordia have create what salvage specialist call unparalleled challenge not only to right the ship but also to protect giglio island a marine sanctuary from environmental hazard
salvage worker use huge jack cable pulley and specialized equipment first to ease the vessel off its rocky perch and then to right it
the first few_hour be the most uncertain as we could_not establish how_much the hull be wedge sergio girotto project manager with micoperi the project 's underwater construction and offshore contractor say on_monday
the ship 's captain francesco schettino be schedule to go on trial this fall on charge of multiple manslaughter cause a shipwreck and abandon the vessel before everyone be safe
he have deny wrongdoing
a company official and four crew_member have_already plead_guilty to reduced charge
salvage master and the italian authorities have prepare_for complication
most of the fuel be siphon off within month of the wreck
but the vessel that once transport and entertain 4,229 people still contain chemical and diesel fuel that could leak into the pristine mediterranean water for which giglio a popular tourist spot be know

kabul_afghanistan the top united_nations human_right official emerge_from a meeting here with president hamid karzai on_tuesday without hop for assurance that he would reverse his decision to pack the country_'s human_right commission with political appointee
the united_nations high commissioner for human_right navi pillay be also generally critical about progress on human_right in the country say it be endanger in part_because official be more focused on political concern ahead of presidential_election next april
there have be some human_right achievement during the past 12 year but they be fragile ms. pillay say during a news_conference on_tuesday at the end of a two day visit here
and many afghans be express fear that the overall human_right situation be deteriorate on several front
human_right activist have be particularly alarm by mr. karzai 's five new appointee to the nine member afghan independent human_rights commission
none of the five be on a list propose by civic and human_right group and they include a former taliban official a polarizing politician from the country_'s lead fundamentalist party jamiat i islami and a police general
ms. pillay have_already warn publicly that the appointment may lead to the commission be downgrade in its status internationally which could in turn lead to its international financing be cut_off
this would be a very serious and regrettable setback for one of the current afghan_government 's most notable achievement in the area of human_right she_say
ms. pillay say that in her meeting with mr. karzai she again ask_him to rescind those appointment
i make convincing argument for him she_say
i leave in the hope that he will revisit the matter
he do_not specifically say that he would
the afghan human_right commission have often anger member of the country_'s political elite particularly the many former warlord with dubious human_right record who hold powerful position in afghanistan 's govern institution
ms. pillay also praise mr. karzai for what she call his strong public stand against the use of torture in numerous afghan detention facility
but she also note_that such torture continue to be common and that there have not be a single successful prosecution of a state employee for torture
in_january 2012 the chicago bears be look for a new general_manager
that search end with the hiring of phil emery a relative unknown who be the kansas_city chiefs director of college scouting
emery do_not make any immediate splash but one year_later he make two bold decision that could have easily turn the chicago faithful against_him
the bears go 10 6 in 2012 but emery choose to fire coach lovie smith
the move be not without controversy marty schottenheimer and steve mariucci have be the only coach in the last 20_year to be fire after win 10 game
bears player like smith and replace him be go to be challenge no_matter whom emery hire
but emery go a step further he do_not hire an aspire young offensive coordinator or the next great college coach
instead he go to the canadian football_league to find marc trestman the coach of the montreal alouettes
the next decision may have be even more courageous
emery and trestman get into a public contract dispute with brian urlacher the on field face of the bears for the last decade
chicago could have re sign urlacher whose contract be expire but new management offer in urlacher 's word a lowball contract to retain him
as it turn_out emery and trestman read the market correctly urlacher retire after find that no team be willing_to spend big money on an age linebacker
the new leader risk alienate fan and lose the good will that new hire typically receive
but few fan seem to be spend_much time these_day think_about whether emery should have retain smith or urlacher
that ' because the bears one of the more exciting team in the n.f.l. be 2_0
the decision by emery and trestman to fix the offense which be always smith 's blind_spot have be pay off
for year the offensive_line have be the team 's weak unit and emery make that a key focus of his off_season
chicago 's first_round pick in this_year 's draft be oregon 's kyle long who be now entrenched at right guard
at left guard the bears sign matt slauson who have be a cog in one of the league 's best offensive_line for year with the jets
chicago address the left tackle spot by land jermon bushrod who have be protect drew brees 's blind side for four_year in new_orleans
at right tackle the fifth round pick jordan mills win the job give chicago four new starter on the line
center roberto garza be the only holdover of a line that be no_longer hold the team back
in_2011 and 2012 bears quarterback be sack a combine 93 time second most in the league
but jay cutler have be sack only once this_season particularly impressive give that the two team the bears beat minnesota and cincinnati have defense that finish in the top seven in sack and in sack rate in 2012
the run blocking appear improve too
accord_to nathan jahnke of pro football focus chicago 's average rush gain before contact in 2012 be just 2.0 yard
despite face two strong front seven the bears have average 2.3 yard before contact this_year
trestman 's system seem to be do wonder for cutler too
pro football focus track how long it take after the snap for a quarterback to throw a pas be sack or scramble
accord_to jahnke cutler average 2.81 second in_2011 and 2.79 in 2012
through two week in 2013 cutler have be make quick decision or find his receiver open more quickly and that average have drop to 2.57
it be not just trestman 's system and the line that be make life easy for cutler
the team finally give him a playmaking tight_end
in_2011 chicago tight_end caught just 25 pass for 256 yard in 2012 they catch 33 pass for just 318 yard
in both year the bears rank last in both category
one of emery 's big off_season move be the acquisition of the talented but enigmatic martellus bennett
he have 10 catch for 125 yard and 3 touchdown in the team 's first two game include the winner on_sunday against the vikings
that have help open thing up for the team 's all pro wide_receiver brandon marshall who with 15 catch 217 yard and 2 touchdown continue to play at an elite level
how the bears season will unfold be still in question of course but it do look as if hire emery last_year and trestman this_year will give the team a strong foundation
cutler have complete 68.1 percent of his pass the first two week and have a 95.4 passer rating both would easily be career high if he be to maintain that pace
this_year may turn_into a special season for cutler in more way than one he be also just 1,863 pass yard from overtake sid luckman and become the franchise 's career leader
cutler 's comebacks jay cutler lead a fourth_quarter comeback for the second week in a row the sixth time since_2002 that a quarterback have do that in both of his team 's first two game
it_' the second time for cutler who first pull_off the feat with denver in 2007
the others matt schaub 2013 houston michael vick 2012 philadelphia jake delhomme 2008 carolina and alex smith 2007 san_francisco
slow
go with rush nearly every team have an unsuccessful running game in week 1 there be 824 rush attempt for 2,984 yard and 18 touchdown which come_out to an ugly 3.62 yard a carry across
the n.f.l. thing be only slightly better in week 2 with a 3.99 average on 833 carry for 3,322 yard and 18 touchdown
some of the main culprit be pittsburgh the giants jacksonville cleveland and miami
for the season all five team have rush for less_than 125 yard and have average less_than 3.5 yard a carry
touchdown bonanza eddie royal catch just 10 touchdown pass in his first five season and have only one touchdown with san_diego last_season
but royal already have five touchdown reception in the chargers first two game this_season tie an n.f.l. record
five other player catch five touchdown pass in their team first two game marvin harrison 1999 colts daryl turner 1985 seahawks ben hawkins 1969 eagles elroy hirsch 1951 rams and bobby shaw 1950 cardinals
peyton manning have nine touchdown pass tie the record hold by charley johnson 1965 cardinals and drew brees 2009 saints
i like to think of my roomba as cute and industrious
he make noise while he clean that make me feel as if he ' communicate with me which contribute to the fact_that i have assign him a sex
he exist in a liminal space between animate and inanimate but once he ' do clean my floor i do_not mind put him in the closet until i need his service again he ' a rolling disc after all
robosimian a headless quadrupedal disaster response robot design by engineer at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory be a bit more useful than my roomba slightly more human look and a_lot less cute the c-3po to my r2-d2
robosimian can maneuver over rubble and through narrow corridor in order to one day rescue human from peril
but its more_difficult task will be form some_sort of bond with the e.m.t. 's and first responder who may use it
robosimian will be more_than just a tool but not_quite a colleague
in the future more robot will occupy that strange gray zone do_not only job that human can do but also job that require social grace
in the last decade an interdisciplinary field of research call human robot interaction have arise to study the factor that make robot work well with human and how human view their robotic counterpart
h.r.i. researcher have discover some rather surprising thing a robot 's behavior can have a big impact on its relationship_with human than its design many of the rule that govern human relationship apply equally well to human robot relation and people will read emotion and motivation into a robot 's behavior that far exceed the robot 's capability
as we employ those lesson to build robot that can be better caretaker maid and emergency responder we risk further blur the once unnecessary line between tool and being
provide with the right behavioral cue human will form relationship_with just about anything regardless of what it look_like
even a stick can trigger our social promiscuity
in_2011 ehud sharlin a computer scientist at the university of calgary run an observational experiment to test this impulse to connect
his subject sit alone in a room with a very simple robot a long balsa wood rectangle attach to some gear control by a joystick wield human who hide from view run it through a series of predetermined movement
sharlin want_to find out how_much agency human would attribute to a stick
some subject try_to fight the stick or talk it out of want_to fight them
one woman panic complain that the stick would not stop point at her
some try_to dance with it
the study find that a vast_majority assume the stick have its_own goal and internal thought procâ­ess
they describe the stick as bow in greeting search_for hide item even purr like a contented cat
when a robot move on its_own it exploit a fundamental social instinct that all human have the ability_to separate thing into object like rock and tree and agent like a bug or another person
its evolutionary importance seem self evident typically kid can do this by the time they_'re a year old
the distinction run deep than know something be capable of movement
nobody question the motivation of a rock roll down a hill say brian scassellati director of yale 's social robotics lab
agent on the other_hand have internal state that we speculate about
the ability_to distinguish between agent and object be the basis for another important human skill that scientist call cognitive empathy or theory of mind depend_on whom you ask the ability_to predict what other being be think and what they want by watch how they move
we make these assumption very quickly and naturally scassellati say
and it_' not new or even limit to the world of robotics
look_at animation
they know the rule too
a sack of flour can look sad or angry
it_' all about how it move

apparently the test result have be unfavorable because the site have be close again
that be echo by farshad ghorbanpour a political_analyst close to the government
it seem to me the authorities want_to see what would happen if the web_site be open he say
this be not uncommon in iran
it be unclear exactly what the authorities would have be seek to find out with such a test
conservative tend_to favor a technical glitch as the explanation for the unblocking of the web_site
god willing this have be a mistake judge abdolsamad khoramabadi a prominent hard liner tell the semiofficial mehr news_agency
but if this be do on purpose we will confront those behind it
judge khoramabadi warn on_sunday that facebook be destroy family say that it be the cause of one fifth of all divorce in the united_states
some official seem to be unaware of the danger of this web_site when they speak of unblock it he tell the khabaronline web news site
on_tuesday the semiofficial fars news_agency publish a long article point_out the danger of social_medium say that facebook be blur the line between private and public
many woman choose profile picture without their islamic scarf fars write in an editorial
facebook be aim to blur our cultural line between private and public
there be no border on facebook
this be extremely dangerous
but in another sign that monday 's unblocking be a test a well_know tv anchor reza rashidpour who campaign for mr._rouhani congratulate iranians on_monday for gain unrestricted social_medium access but also caution them
we hope our people will restrain themselves and our official will be patient he say
if indeed a test be conduct it seem to reveal a pent up hunger for less restriction and more interaction

paris european auto sale decline again in_august an industry group report on_tuesday erase a rare gain in_july
new passenger car registration fall 5_percent in_august from a year_earlier the european automobile manufacturers association report_from brussels after a 5_percent increase in_july
the july gain be only the second year over year rise in 2013 after a 1.7_percent rise in_april
the association release data for both july and august simultaneously after its summer recess
figure for the two month be distort by calendar difference august 2013 have one few work day than a year_earlier while july have one more
for the first eight month of the year sale be just 7,841,596 unit the low reading for that period since the association begin track the data in 1990
harald hendrikse an analyst at nomura international in london say that take together the two month appear to have be roughly flat from a year_earlier
the good_news be that there be probably no more deterioration he say
clearly from a low low base we be stabilize
the bad_news be that it_' not get any better either
the european auto market have be in retreat since the financial_crisis the downward progress halt at time only by the temporary stimulus of government cash for clunker program in which owner receive tax rebate in exchange for trading in old car
unemployment be high in europe 12.1 percent in the 17-country euro_zone generally and more_than 25_percent in spain and greece
and car be see as a luxury rather_than a necessity by those consumer who have access_to good public transportation
with no new job with a decline population and with an age population demand for new car naturally decline mr. hendrikse say note_that a similar phenomenon be occur in japan where car demand have be shrink for most of the last 25_year
in the united_states by_contrast car sale have be steadily exceed last_year 's pace
mr. hendrikse predict that european sale would decline about 5_percent this_year and remain essentially flat in 2014
for 2015 he predict a mod 2 percent increase
one quirk of the european slump have be that among major market only british sale have hold up this_year
the british market grow by 10.9 percent in_august from a year_earlier
the german market the large in europe shrink by 5.5 percent while france decline by 10.5 percent and spain by 18.3 percent
italian sale fall by 6.6 percent
mr. hendrikse say britain 's resilience stem partly from the fact_that the country be further along in the economic cycle than europe and partly_because british consumer be more willing_to use credit for car purchase than their continental counterpart
louise wallis a spokeswoman_for the retail motor industry federation a british trade group say that at_least half of all vehicle finance in britain be now sell use deal know as personal contract purchasing
under such financing similar to leasing in the united_states the consumer pay relatively low monthly_payment for three_year and then have the option of either pay a large balloon payment and take ownership or simply return the car to the manufacturer and start over
most people opt to turn over the key and get a new car ms. wallis say
among european car company volkswagen the large post an 11.2 percent decline in_august sale lead lower by the 17.3 percent drop in its flagship brand
sale at the french automaker p.s.a. peugeot citroã«n the continent 's no 2 automaker fall 17.3 percent in_august
renault post a 6 percent increase on the strength of its low cost dacia brand
daimler sale rise 5.8 percent on demand for its mercedes benz car as sale of its smart car slide nearly 24 percent

jack ewing contribute_report from frankfurt
it_' not worth try_to persuade anyone to become vegan for a couple of very_good reason one it_' a losing battle and two it_' far from certain that a diet with no animal product be best for everyone
it_' increasingly evident however that a part time vegan diet one that emphasize minimally processed plant food at the expense of everything_else be the direction that will do the most to benefit human health increase animal welfare and reduce environmental impact
the remain challenge an undeniably big one be to figure_out how to make such a diet which you may also call flexitarian the standard
my_own diet which i call vegan
before 6 and write a book about be one way of tackle part time veganism but it be not the only way
an intelligent adaptation of the mediterranean diet one of the popular fast today feast tomorrow diet or even a so_call paleo diet one that stress vegetable rather_than animal product our great ancestor after all be gatherer hunter who saw meat not as routine but as an occasion to feast can put you on the right track
as can this a day of your choosing when you just go vegan
there be of course true vegan who will say that part time veganism be a little_bit pregnant kind_of thing that_is impossible
but since the word mean a diet without animal product it can be use to describe something as part time as a meal a salad be after all a vegan meal
i be aware have have this argument dozen of time in the last_few year that many full_time vegan primary concern be animal welfare and that ' a different discussion
be a vegan be not my point and anyway it_' as easy to create an unhealthy full_time vegan diet as it be to eat brilliantly as a part time vegan
it just take a little thought and a little will though perhaps less will than you may think at first
many cook dish that contain animal product can be and traditionally have be make without them usually out of want
the problem for most people in developed country be not a lack of opportunity to eat animal product but a superabundance
it be not as if vegetable be in short supply
yes local or organic produce be expensive and so inconveniently seasonal but if_you be go to eat it now be your chance
it be not a coincidence that this column be appear in september to me the period between labor day and thanksgiving be the best time of year to cook warm enough to grill and cool enough to braise with the farmer_market still an_absolute paradigm of abundance
take_advantage in a few_month there may be little more_than root vegetable apple cider and hand dye yarn
when fruit and vegetable be at their best they give you insight_into how the vegan thing can work for you if only for a day
and give a moderate degree of freshness most conventional vegetable from ordinary supermarket can be make to taste good when garden go dormant
plant base meal contain more_than vegetable of course stock the pantry with good grain legume nut seed oil vinegar and other classic condiment and you_'re set to make an infinite number of dish that do_not ruffle a single animal 's feather hide or fin
here then be some recipe for what you may call a vegan day
i do_not pretend that you_'re likely_to eat all five in the same day or even that they have much relationship to one another but they_'re each a representation of the kind_of thing you may be eat at a give moment
some be simple traditional peasant food hoecake make from little but corn and water may_seem ascetic until you recognize that this be polenta in a fast crunchy form fill_with flavor and perfect to bury under a pile of fruit
you_can jazz them up if_you like a little sugar a little baking powder a little nondairy milk maybe some maple syrup and they start to resemble something far rich and more common
i happen to like the ultraminimalist version
some be elaborate and design to satisfy an open minded if devote meat eater at the big meal of the day
this ratatouille with chickpea and fennel be among the best i have ever make and bow tie with bulgur and what amount to a salad be as good at room temperature as any pasta i know
the others be creatively simple carrot candy be as much fun to eat as it be to look_at broil melon be a lovely and unusual dessert
the option be infinite i_love jook for breakfast as_well as more conventional porridge or mush or something more modern like quinoa cook in almond milk
chop salad may have become a cliche but there may not be a better vegan lunch you may try one with a thai- or japanese flavored dressing for variety
a snack can of course be as simple as popcorn jazz up with nut and raisin
dinner
i could live on pasta with vegetable for week
you may try it if only for a day
if the m.r.i. scan that the neurosurgeon be point to be as it appear to me a map of south america the tumor in the brain of my wife denise be the size of brazil
enormous impose bulge all its border not to be deny
it be early october
denise have not be herself for month
a cheerful and enthusiastic woman dedicate to her family her friend her work she have become distant lethargic
often fatigued her interest and activity have diminish
her co_worker have call ask_if she be all right her_sister have take note her friend could_not understand the change in her
i_think that she be tired possibly depressed
i_think that maybe she be in a rut that patience and empathy be need
what be need be surgery
after a fall at home from which she could_not rise we go to the emergency_room where the question the examination and an m.r.i. turn up what be wrong denise have a meningioma grow in the membrane between her brain and her skull
it have probably be grow for year and be now seven centimeter of a size and weight that be affect her vision her function her balance her personality
denise be in the hospital for six_week
she remain valiant and determine through three brain surgery and intense physical and occupational therapy
she never falter
she start therapy as soon as she could from light bedside therapy to participation from a wheelchair through work with a walker to walk with a cane
i observe one afternoon and be mightily impress with denise 's determination to get up and down the training step to swing in and out of the car door simulation to work at it until she be too tired to continue
she want_to give her all as she have do since i have know her
denise want_to return to the people the interest the very life that she enjoy and be missing
on the drive back and forth to the hospital inspire_by denise i find_myself think quite a_lot about the life that i have be miss not just since her surgery but for the 35_year of our marriage
i be a survivor of severe sexual_abuse that go on intermittently throughout my childhood
it happen i know that it happen and i have to live with it every_day
when you grow_up like that you be wary all the time you rarely get close to anyone and you do_not go around have feeling where people can see them
my method of cop be my manner low visibility in and go distance
denise saw through me and sign on anyway when we be both young
i have never consider that i could be love by anyone
when i meet denise i be to my great benefit open enough to understand that she be a person with whom i could share myself
i commit to her and to a life together
there have be only a few occasion in my_life when i have look and actually see what be in front of me and fully feel the feeling i be feel
one time be watch her walk down the aisle toward me beam on our wedding day
i never look away

tehran iran_'s supreme_leader seem to put his authority behind iran_'s moderate new president on_tuesday call for heroic leniency in navigate the country_'s diplomatic dispute with the west

but ask about the tone of mr._obama 's letter something the iranians be extremely sensitive about marzieh afkham the ministry spokeswoman say iran expect improvement in the way washington talk to iran
unfortunately the u.s. administration be still adopt the language of threat while deal_with iran ms. afkham say at a weekly news_conference

the united_states and iran have have no diplomatic relation since washington end tie after the seizure of 52 diplomatic personnel in 1979 after the islamic revolution

ms. afkham say mr._obama have initiate the exchange of letter by congratulate mr._rouhani on his election victory
mr._rouhani express thanks for the congratulation and write about various issue she_say without elaborate on what they be
iran and the united_states be at loggerhead over tehran 's dispute nuclear_program and they be on oppose side in syria_'s civil_war

washington a month before a murderous rampage_at the washington_navy yard aaron_alexis call the police in rhode_island to complain that he have change hotel three time because he be be pursue by people keep him awake by send vibration through the wall
when officer come to his hotel_room early on_aug. 7 mr._alexis tell them that a person he have argue with at an airport in virginia have send three people to follow him and that they be harass him with a microwave machine accord_to a newport r.i. police report
mr._alexis say he have hear_voice speak to him through the wall flooring and ceiling the report say
mr._alexis tell the police he be a navy contractor and then twice that month he seek treatment from the veterans_affairs department for psychiatric issue accord_to a senior_law enforcement_official
but it do_not raise a red_flag that may have prevent him from enter the military base in washington where the authorities_say he kill_12 people on_monday
on_wednesday mr._alexis 's mother apologize to the victim in a brief statement she read from her brooklyn home
i do_not know_why he do what he do and i will never be_able to ask_him why cathleen alexis say
aaron be now in a place_where he can no_longer do harm to anyone and for that i be glad
to the family of the victim i be so so very sorry that this happen
my_heart be break
the episode in rhode_island add to a grow list of question_about how mr._alexis who have a history of infraction as a navy_reservist mental_health problem and run in with the police over gun_violence gain and keep a security_clearance from the defense_department that give him access_to military base include the navy_yard where he be shoot to death by the police
time and again mr._alexis 's behavior fall below a level that would have bring a serious response like a less_than honorable discharge from the military or involuntary commitment to a mental institution expert and official_say
but the sheer number of episode raise_question about the government 's system for vet people for security_clearance include the thousand_of contractor who help run the nation_'s military and security system work
though the case be different the access grant mr._alexis a former_navy reservist who as an_independent contractor service navy computer raise_question similar to those raise about another outside government contractor edward_j. snowden who leak national intelligence secret
these two incident combine suggest to me a very flawed system for grant security_clearance say senator susan collins republican of maine who call for a congressional investigation_into the granting of security_clearance to government contractor
who know_how many other snowdens and aaron alexises be out there
on_tuesday president_obama order the white_house budget_office to conduct a governmentwide review of policy for security_clearance for contractor and employee in federal agency
in an_interview with noticias telemundo the president say the nation do_not have a firm enough background_check system
he also call once_again for congress to enact legislation to keep gun out of the hand of criminal and those with mental_illness
i do get concerned that this become a ritual that we go_through every three four month where we have these horrific mass_shooting he say
senior pentagon official also say that defense_secretary chuck hagel intend_to review physical security and access at all defense_department installation around the world

as one who along_with a great majority of the american people say enough be enough i would like to make three point
one our experience of go into a country to topple a hat dictator have not be meet with gratitude all side in the arab/muslim world hate us so we_need to learn to give_up that ghost
two if it_' so important for turkey or saudi_arabia to get_rid of president_bashar al_assad of syria then let_them do the fighting
three we have fail to put forth any sort_of meaningful or realistic geopolitical strategy
i commend my fellow americans for be far ahead of the president and the pundit on these issue
melvin vigman summit new_jersey cohen be clearly on the side of the hawk
his column leave no_doubt about that
to make his point he even get back to his german source to world_war ii and postwar berlin but apparently not to the debacle of vietnam iraq and afghanistan
these be all failure
an intervention in syria could join the list
renaat horemans mol belgium
credibility be a prized word in international politics
country that keep their promise and enforce their red_line can be count on to deter their enemy and assure their allies
nation as with human being develop reputation and those that break their pledge be impossible to trust
as such the failure of the united_states to bomb syria be bind to empower iran and reinforce its quest for nuclear arm
the only problem with such assertion be that the historical record suggest_that the so_call credibility argument rest on a very thin intellectual rail
america_'s enemy put premium on its capability rather_than indication of its resolve
it be washington 's allies however that be likely_to prove sensitive to its intention as oppose to its actual power
the event of the past_few week have probably impact israel more so than iran
the most tragic application of the credibility argument for the united_states be the vietnam war
during washington 's quarter of century involvement in southeast asia successive administration never claim that vietnam by itself be relevant for u.s. security but that the failure to stop the advance of communism there be bind to embolden the soviet_union
america fight in vietnamese jungle to prove to the kremlin that once the united_states draw its red_line it would use all of its power to achieve its objective
in one of the irony of history the collapse of u.s. effort in vietnam be follow a decade and a half later by the demise of the soviet_union
the guardian of the theocratic state be clever man accustomed to sense the subtlety of power
although cavalier in their public pronouncement and bold in term of their adventure in the middle_east iran_'s military man do respect america_'s armada assemble on their periphery
they know well that washington be anxious to avoid a cascade of proliferation in the critical gulf region
and they know that the united_states have the military power to destroy their nuclear infrastructure
it be this calculus more so than america_'s reticence in syria that weigh on the mind of the mullah
give the fact_that iran appreciate u.s. power how can one account for its_nuclear truculence
just because tehran recognize the reality of american strength that do_not mean that iran will readily acquiesce to its mandate
the clerical leader have their_own version_of two track policy to forestall an american attack
on the one hand they point to their deterrent capability terrorist allies such as hezbollah be emphasize and the notion of inflict damage on america_'s military and diplomatic personnel be subtly stressed
at the same_time iran have entangle the united_states in a prolonged diplomatic process that have successfully defer a military response
iran_'s diplomatic track have be complement by a charm offensive emphasize its readiness to arrive_at a mutually satisfactory settlement
it be very hard for washington to justify a strike on iran give the probability of retaliation and tehran 's seem willingness_to resolve the issue at the negotiating table
while not bomb syria may not have have a measurable impact on iran_'s calculation it be likely_to condition israel 's response to the islamic republic 's nuclear imbroglio
for israelis as with all small power measure the reliability of their superpower patron intention matter more_than capability
it be not america_'s actual military power but its willingness_to use that power that impress its allies
what israelis have see of late be a washington that face with a violation of its red_line on the use of weapon of mass_destruction embrace a russian effort at the united_nations security_council
there be no two entity with less credibility in jerusalem on the issue of unconventional weapon than russia and the united_nations
prime_minister benjamin netanyahu and his hawkish adviser may yet conclude_that any forceful resolution of the iran crisis require israel act alone
whatever the probability of israeli bombing iran_'s facility may have be prior to the syrian crisis those number have only go up
the recent syrian melodrama indicate how little historical assessment penetrate governmental deliberation
the notion that we have to bomb damascus to impress tehran be short sighted and without much analytical underpinning
there may be ample justification for the use of force against a regime that have use chemical_weapon against unarmed citizen
indeed the tragedy of the syrian civil_war have long call out for a more determined international effort
however in assess the effect of the recent crisis one have to conclude_that its impact will be feel more in israel than in iran

the silver maserati arrive_at the diagonal the wide avenue in barcelona
watch now say the driver i_'ll beat all the light except the last
there be eight set of traffic light in an 800-meter or 2,600-foot stretch
the first seven be pass while they be still green
the year be 1974
the man at the wheel be johan cruyff
and the car symbolize the way he be and be lean quicksilver fast and forever challenge the limitation around him
this wednesday_evening barcelona play ajax amsterdam in the champions_league
it will be the first competitive meeting of the two club that cruyff help to make great helped indeed to exhibit some of the most mellifluous style in the global game
he be bear in amsterdam and have live in barcelona for more_than half his 66 year yet cruyff have vow not to be in the camp nou stadium on_wednesday
i will support ajax he say on rtl television in the netherlands
i have have some difference with barã§a 's president and i will not set foot in the camp nou as long as he be there
this too be symptomatic of johan cruyff
there be his way of do thing and any_other way have to be wrong
the vast_majority of the 710 game he play and the 401 goal he score be for ajax or barcelona or the netherlands national_team
he even choose catalonia 's team as his second club because it represent the opposition to francisco franco 's dictatorship in spain
but to cruyff life be what he could control on the field
he be bear close to the ajax stadium in the east of amsterdam his_mother be a clean at the club and he be draw into the youth system there
even before rinus michels the stern trainer at ajax and later at barcelona become know as the father of total football cruyff be know for express all the skill of every position
he express them through movement and very_much through his outspoken opinion
when he speak too_much the coach would threaten to fine him or bad send_him home
but they even michels be inspire_by the beauty of cruyff 's belief that soccer need not be a sport of fix positional play or stereotypical pattern
when we watch lionel messi thrive in the barã§a team coach by pep guardiola a couple of season ago this be cruyff 's soccer
he be the coach who give guardiola his debut as a player and whose 1992 barcelona dream team set the seed for the barã§a of today
cruyff be its coach the head coach of the entire club from the academy up
guardiola be the captain of a side that feature jose maria bakero txiki begiristain gheorghe hagi michael laudrup romã¡rio hristo stoichkov and the inevitable dutch connection ronald koeman
and where ajax with cruyff the player triumph in the old european cup he later coach barcelona to the same title
even today the catalan dutch connection be maintain
frank de boer the current ajax coach play for barcelona from 1999 to 2003
economics have determine that the modern ajax be no_longer as flamboyant or as competitive as the one that cruyff lead to european glory
it still have its youth system but barã§a 's be big better and able_to augment its graduate with world class import
neymar cost barcelona the better part_of â¬100 million about_$ 134 million once the transfer payment to his brazilian club santos and his salary over the length of his contract be take into account
cruyff 's transfer fee when he leave ajax for barcelona be also in the ten of million but in peseta the former spanish currency and worth about_$ 2 million
it be another time another valuation and even the maserati be then around $_10,000 worth of extravagance
what have not change in cruyff 's eye be that soccer be just a game
drive by commerce but it be still a game that in his case come from the street and from his vision
neymar and messi may be aspire cruyff like figure license to thrill
but one of cruyff 's difference with barcelona 's president sandro rosell be that the dutchman do_not believe the team need neymar
cruyff 's opinion state on tv and in newspaper column be that neymar and messi duplicate rather_than complement each_other
the sign of the past_few week have suggest otherwise although neymar have go to great length to forego his_own scoring opportunity while he try_to set_up messi
that may be the brazilian 's way of show he know his place in the pecking order in catalonia and that he be bid time before seek a leading role
ajax alas come without_any comparable star
it have a promising young playmaker the dane christian eriksen but it sell him this_month to tottenham hotspur for about_$ 18 million
that money be lifeblood to ajax but since eriksen leave the team have lose its rhythm
if messi have see image of the way we play at the weekend say coach de boer i doubt he ' too concerned
cruyff who have fall out with the board_member run both his former club have become the great outsider
he think rosell the president of barã§a be too mercenary
and he be blame the coach for the way that ajax struggle
just because someone have a drive license cruyff say of de boer do_n't mean he be capable of drive a formula_one car
straight to the point like his straight line drive 39 year_ago in barcelona

cardiff wales donizetti never think of his three opera about tudor queen as a trilogy and scarcely anyone_else do either until the soprano beverly sills sing them at the new_york city_opera in the 1970
each with a libretto by a different author they be premier over a seven_year period 1830 1837 in different italian theater with different singer as the royal protagonist giuditta pasta anna bolena maria malibran maria stuarda and giuseppina ronzi de begnis elizabeth i in roberto devereux
the story familiar from both history and literary fabrication be far apart chronologically
yet each culminate in an execution anne boleyn 's in 1536 at the behest of her_husband henry viii for among_other thing alleged infidelity mary stuart ' in 1587 because of the threat she pose to elizabeth i ' rule and robert devereux 's in 1601 for treason
at the heart of each plot be one or more love triangle whether root in reality or invent
authentic or not the tudor trilogy be happily with us for these be fine opera
choose a favorite be not easy mine tend_to be the one i have encounter most_recently in a convincing performance
as with wagner 's ring opera company often mount the individual opera gradually but the intrepid welsh national opera now in its third season under the note stage director david pountney 's leadership be currently introduce them in new production at the wales millennium center within the space of just a month
anna bolena and maria stuarda be now in repertory with roberto devereux to follow on_oct. 7
the ambitious schedule impose challenge on the company 's production and musical capability from which it do_not emerge unscathed but the burden be lessen by have the same set serve for all three opera a functional black box design by madeleine boyd
she also design the prevailingly black costume which have detail suggestive both of tudor and of more recent time
in_addition responsibility be share by two director and two conductor alessandro talevi and daniele rustioni for anna bolena and roberto devereux rudolf frey and graeme jenkins for maria stuarda
only two character elizabeth i and her stern adviser william cecil appear in more_than one opera
but mr. talevi 's powerful staging ingeniously allow elizabeth to appear in all three opera by show her_mother anne boleyn in the aftermath of give_birth to the future monarch at the start of anna bolena
not only do this introduce us to the woman whose dictate dominate the succeed opera but the issue of elizabeth 's illegitimate birth be bring to the fore
prior to her marriage anne be betroth to henry percy news of which enrage the operatic henry by cast doubt on the legitimacy of his marriage to anne and as he allude to in word that be easily overlook also reflect adversely on his infant daughter
it all constitute telling preparation for the famous if fictionalized confrontation between the two queen in maria stuarda when mary hold as elizabeth 's prisoner and torment beyond endurance by her insult denounce her publicly as the sully daughter of boleyn and a vile bastard
sadly mr. frey 's staging fall_short of do that opera justice
within the black box set another box serve_as mary 's prison cell elizabeth appear in it dejectedly at the end thereby draw a parallel between the two queen
but the device do_not help the action which be mar elsewhere by such distraction as mary smoke a cigarette in her entrance aria and an embarrassing foot washing episode during the moving scene in which mary 's supporter george talbot receive her confession accord_to catholic tenet
musically too anna bolena come off better
the soprano serena farnocchia may not be the most charismatic of annas but her singing be consistently attractive and in face rejection death and temporary madness she deal_with anna 's overwhelming final scene grippingly sometimes couch in elizabeth 's crib 1_2 next_page
london
the london theater be in a fearsome mood these_day whether on large stage or small
indeed during a recent_week of playgoing i learn that goodness be nothing more_than another word for cowardice that same_sex affection be likely_to end in something far bloody than tear and that even a pet guinea pig be not immune from the brutishness course through the capital 's stage of late
the best_know of these scenario have arrive courtesy of christopher marlowe a contemporary of shakespeare they be bear the same year who may not_quite possess his colleague 's unequivocal lyricism but who also know a thing or two about the price pay for kingship go awry
edward ii remain one of marlowe 's best_know text and it be often pair in conversation and sometimes in performance with richard_ii shakespeare 's eternally rhapsodic yet mournful history play
but while the royal shakespeare company prime richard_ii for a new production later this fall the national have get in first with an edward ii that be sure to divide spectator on every front but one the superb performance of the fast ascend actor john heffernan in the title role
in fact the modish approach take by the director joe hill gibbins mark his national debut wo_not surprise those familiar with his esteemed track record at the young vic where mr. hill gibbins direct two separate account of the changeling the jacobean tragedy that occupy much the same take no prisoner landscape as edward ii.
but whereas that staging place the audience behind net and allow the actor as require to cover one another with vary kind_of glop chocolate jam
his edward blur the distinction between theater and film by present sizable swath of the action on screen that flank the olivier auditorium
sometimes the conceit make perfect sense
in a narrative rife with backstairs intrigue why not grant us access_to the going on backstage
at other time it feel_like a distraction too far
it_' difficult to argue too_much however with a tactic that keep playgoer apprise at every turn of mr. heffernan 's keenly sensitize portrayal edward 's downward spiral make doubly plain by scene title inform us of the grim trajectory of the piece as it be happen
even act behind a beard in what must be the most hirsute production in memory the actor awaken us to edward 's grievous surrender to the sleep deprived torment that soon_after lead to his gruesome demise
a benchmark work in the canon of gay themed drama edward ii spend_much of its first_half obsess about the banishment of edward 's lowly beloved gaveston who be no sooner expel from view than the king be demand his return
play what amount to a human yo yo the london base american actor kyle soller get to act in his_own accent a clever way of separate gaveston out from the array of noble and the like who have no time for him
mr. soller be an olivier nominee this past spring for his west end performance in eugene o'neill 's long day 's journey into night
mr. soller 's various entrance also help lend an intimacy to the large of the national 's three venue while presumably function as their_own aerobics class
this be the elizabethan theater at once juiced up and in your face
traditionalist will be dismay but the rapt matinee crowd among whom i sit one recent afternoon take it in their stride
across town at the royal court the primary theater for new writing have get its new season off to a scarcely less contentious start
the ritual slaughter of gorge mastromas gorge in this instance be pronounce as if it be george spring from the febrile imagination of dennis kelly the british playwright who win a tony in_june for his book for the musical matilda

it be hard to dream up a more auspicious series of event for pat quinn illinois 's governor whose re_election hope have appear shaky enough that a line of fellow democrats have be salivate over his job for age
in_july lisa madigan the illinois attorney_general and daughter of the powerful longtime state house_speaker say that she have decide against running for governor cite her_father 's role as a reason
in_august kwame raoul who replace barack obama in this state 's senate say he have decide against it too
and on_tuesday william m. daley a member of one of chicago 's most influential democratic family who say just month_ago that he be run for governor announce that he have change his mind
i_'ve lose sleep to be frank with you and be struggle over the last couple of week as to whether or not what ' need i can provide over a long period mr._daley who have be deeply critical of mr._quinn and the state 's miserable financial circumstance say in a sometimes emotional news_conference here
it_' not about a campaign of six_month or 14 month
it really be about a minimum of five to nine year to begin to straighten out this state
the voter of illinois deserve someone_who ' go to commit not just to a tough campaign but to the more_difficult job of govern this state a state which deserve better say mr._daley allude in part to illinois 's vastly underfinanced pension system
as i have survey both the rigor of this campaign and the enormity of the challenge of fix these problem i have conclude_that i can_not commit to what the voter may need
the abrupt choice from a veteran of the state 's political world be a remarkable turn of fortune for mr._quinn sweep out at_least for now well_know opponent from a democratic_primary next march
some political expert here point to the late development as only mr._quinn 's most_recent stroke of luck note_that mr._quinn who be once see more as a well mean gadfly than a political heavyweight have ascend to governor in the first place because rod r. blagojevich who be in his second term as governor be arrest on corruption charge in 2008
mr._quinn be the lieutenant governor at the time
still mr._quinn 's fortune will be test in 2014
four well_know republican_candidate have line up to run for governor include bill brady a state_senator whom mr._quinn defeat in a close election in_2010
democrats control the governor 's_office and both chamber of the state_legislature but republicans have win statewide office here in year past largely with some combination of conservative fiscal view and moderate social one
others in the republican field who want mr._quinn 's job dan rutherford the state treasurer bruce rauner a wealthy business executive and kirk dillard a state_senator who run for governor in_2010
but in that there_' another lucky break for quinn say dick simpson a political scientist and former chicago city_council member
the republicans will have a primary to go_through and whoever come_out be likely_to be tarnish
perhaps mr._quinn 's big challenge be in springfield the state capital where lawmaker have argue over how best to repair the state 's pension system and its grow shortfall now estimate at about_$ 100 billion
tension over the impasse bubble over when mr._quinn say he be withhold lawmaker paycheck until they fix the pension system and lawmaker sue him in a case expect to be hear in court on_wednesday
as mr._daley the son of one former chicago mayor and the brother of another as_well as a former white_house chief of staff to president_obama and commerce secretary under president_bill clinton depart the race he say he plan to return to the private_sector
he say he would return campaign contribution
and he pointedly do_not endorse mr._quinn
he say he still believe he could have beat mr._quinn
but the state 's challenge after the election appear more daunting
it_' go to take a governor quite a while to help this state dig out of the mess which it be in mr._daley say
beijing if_you want_to lean in in chinese you take one step_forward
that ' how the title of sheryl sandberg 's contemporary feminist manifesto lean in woman work and the will to lead have be translate here
and you do it with gusto judge from the reaction of about a thousand student and businesspeople at two event in beijing last_week where ms. sandberg the chief operating officer of facebook promote the new chinese version_of her book
people be hungry for it allison ye co founder of a lean in circle in beijing a small_group of peer who meet to talk_about the book 's message say of the response to ms. sandberg 's main point overcome your internal barrier to success and get to the deal table
the enthusiasm suggest an intriguing possibility as the chinese government strike anew against freedom of speech detain even mild mannered democracy activist civil society advocate and popular public_opinion leader may there be a feminist revolution in china before there be a democratic one
in recent_week lean in circle have set_up in half a dozen university in the capital include tsinghua university peking university and the communication university of china member say in interview
i_feel like this be a new stage for us say ms. ye 27 who work for a chinese company
i can_not speak for everyone but i_feel that despite the cultural difference_between america and china the method be universal
i_feel it_' true that you_can take responsibility for yourself it_' a good_thing and then you_can change your situation
of course feminism in china predate ms. sandberg 's book
but it have gain new focus with the arrival of the movement here
ms. ye 's conversion begin in march when she chance online upon a ted talk give by ms. sandberg in_2010 call why we have too few woman leader
she be hook
i be shake she_say
i say to myself who be she
everything she_say be wow
so true
i watch it three time in one day
then i buy an english copy of her book with a friend we say why do_not we open a lean in circle
we_want to support chinese woman and help them set_up their_own circle word spread include to 21-year old carrie huang
two week_ago ms._huang set_up a circle at the prestigious renmin university of china where she study finance
my_friend and i we all feel that we do that we underestimate ourselves she_say in an_interview
it have to do with our education and background
our parent tell_us you be girl get yourself a stable life and do_not have too_much ambition
many young chinese woman especially in city be highly educated and begin to overtake man in some college subject ms._huang say there be 16 woman and 7 man in her finance class but deep cultural message hold them back
we fear we be not good enough
we lack confidence ms._huang say add that many woman in china prioritize their boyfriend or husband goal
what_we need be the courage to try different thing she_say
it_' about discover what you_want to do
parent have wish for us and it_' hard to change
at their weekly meeting ms._huang say she and her half_dozen circlers some of whom be male plan to raise specific question
we_want to talk_about strong woman and how man see them as aggressive or bossy
not everyone like the chinese translation of the book 's impactful english title
some snicker that it be similar to the message find in man 's public urinal to please take a step_forward
ms._huang say it do_not quite catch the psychological nature of ms. sandberg 's message
it make it sound_like it_' about overcome external obstacle take a step_forward she_say
but actually this book be about overcome your inner obstacle
either way experience chinese feminist have welcome it
i_think her message be definitely an empower one call for more woman to get to the deal table say feng yuan an activist for gender right and equality
still it be only one response to the daunting cultural and institutional hurdle face woman in china ms. feng say
i do_not think the personal approach can change the fundamentally unequal gender structure she_say
but in term of a woman 's individual situation it_' useful because a_lot of woman fear feminism that kind_of collective call
a personal message be workable
it may not work for uneducated poor or rural woman ms. feng say an echo of criticism that the book have receive in the west
her target audience be educated and ambitious woman and these woman be_able to mobilize resource to achieve their goal she_say
but we_should not be too critical she_say
you_can not expect her to have a formula for all woman 's right
even the very well educated need this and they should have it
ms._huang and ms. ye say china be ready for lean in regardless of the tight political atmosphere
i_think everything we do in the lean in circle be positive ms._huang say
we_'re not in violation of anything so we_should be o.k.
ms. ye say i_'ve think_about it because i be very careful
i_think if the government allow sheryl sandberg to promote her book then the government support the content of her book
add some irony to the situation facebook be bar from china 's censor internet
a_lot of what she_say fit with the chinese government 's message ms. ye say
i_think as long as we stay within a circle it_' not threaten at all
the obama_administration announce on_tuesday that it be extend minimum_wage and overtime protection to the nation_'s nearly two million home_care worker
advocate for low wage worker have push for this change assert that home_care worker who care for elderly and disabled americans be wrongly classify into the same companionship service category as baby sitter a group that be exempt from minimum_wage and overtime coverage
under the new rule home_care aide unlike baby sitter would be cover under the fair labor standards act the nation_'s main wage and hour law
in an_unusual move the administration say the new regulation would not take effect until jan. 1 2015 even_though regulation often take effect 60 day_after be issue
the delay until 2015 be to give family that use these attendant as_well as state medicaid program time to prepare
industry expert say most of these worker be already pay at_least the minimum_wage but many do_not receive a time and a half overtime premium when they work more_than 40 hour a week
about 20 state exclude home_care worker from their wage and hour law
we think the worker provide this critical work should be receive the same basic protection and coverage as the vast_majority of american worker say laura fortman deputy administrator of the labor_department 's wage and hour division
we_'ve see a_lot of turnover in this industry and we believe_that this new rule will stabilize the work force
the nation_'s home_care worker usually earn $ 8.50 to $_12 an hour accord_to industry official
the federal minimum_wage be $ 7.25 an hour
accord_to the obama_administration almost 40_percent of aide receive government benefit like food_stamp and medicaid
ninety two percent of these worker be female almost 30_percent be black and 12 percent be hispanic
labor secretary thomas e. perez say in a statement today we be take an_important step toward guarantee that these professional receive the wage protection they deserve while protect the right of individual to live at home
but industry official_say the change would cause increase in medicaid and medicare spending raise cost for family that use such service and result in few job for home_care worker
andrea l. devoti chairman of the national_association for home_care and hospice say the new rule will mean that people will receive less care
she_say the high cost result from the new rule would lead many_people to hire home_care aide part time rather_than full_time
caregiver will in the end receive less pay she_say
the newly issue rule be also criticize by representative john kline a minnesota republican who be chairman of the house education and the work force committee and representative tim walberg a michigan republican who head the panel 's subcommittee on work force protection
they say it not only would raise cost but would limit access_to in home_care for vulnerable americans
they add face with high cost some individual will have no choice but to leave their home and enter institutional living
long_term nursing home_care much of which be pay by medicaid be generally more expensive than home_care
ms. fortman of the administration_'s wage and hour division say 15 state now provide overtime and minimum_wage protection to home_care aide
we have not see any evidence_that it have result in job loss or any serious negative impact for the worker or for the people use the service she_say
the administration announce the change 21 month after first propose the rule and after have receive 26,000 public_comment many of them from for profit home_care agency that oppose it
many labor advocate criticize the administration for take so long to issue its final rule but labor_department official_say review the comment and hold related public meeting take time
the federal_government say six million of the 40_million americans old than 65 need some form of daily assistance to live outside a nursing home
federal official estimate that the number will double to 12_million by 2030
under the new rule any home_care aide hire through home_care company or other third party agency can_not be exempt from minimum_wage and overtime coverage
the exemption for aide who mainly provide companionship service define as fellowship and protection for an elderly person or person with an illness injury or disability who require assistance be limit to the individual family or household use the service
if an aide or companion provide care that exceed 20_percent of the total hour she work each week then the worker be to receive minimum_wage and overtime protection
the new rule define care as assist with the activity of daily living like dress groom feed or bathing and assist with instrumental activity of daily living like meal preparation drive light housework manage finance and assist with the physical taking of medication
the companionship exemption will not apply if the aide or companion provide medically relate service that be typically perform by train personnel like nurse or certify nursing assistant
live in domestic service worker who reside in the employer 's home and be employ by an individual family or household be exempt from overtime pay although they must be pay at_least the federal minimum_wage for all hour work
washington as the white_house and congress careen toward another fiscal showdown the nonpartisan congressional budget_office warn on_tuesday that president_obama and lawmaker have be cut the wrong kind_of federal spending as they try_to avoid the unsustainable buildup of debt that be project in the come decade
annual federal deficit will_continue to fall in the short_term the budget_office report in its yearly long_term outlook because of the recent spending_cut in military and domestic program and rise tax collection in a recover economy
the report project the deficit in 2015 to be equal to 2.1 percent of the economy 's output or just one fifth of the peak shortfall at the height of the recession in_2009
but start in 2016 deficit be project to rise again as more baby_boomer begin draw from medicare medicaid and social_security the fast grow entitlement program which democrats and republicans can_not agree on how to rein in
the accumulate federal debt which average 38 percent of the gross_domestic product for the 40 year before the 2008 financial_crisis would rise from 73 percent of the g.d.p. now above what most economist consider an optimum level to at_least 100_percent in 2038
budget expert have be warn since at_least the reagan era that in the early 21st_century age baby_boomer will drive entitlement spending chiefly for medicare and medicaid and to a less degree for social_security to level that will crowd out all other military and domestic spending
interest on the debt will also be a major and grow expense
what be different now be that the republican control house and the white_house have be on a two_year run of deficit reduction that have result because of their inability to agree on entitlement reduction and high tax revenue in deepen cut in the budget area that be not responsible_for the projection of mount debt
those discretionary spending program which include thing as vary as pentagon weapon purchase air traffic control science and research education and national_park be be squeeze even as entitlement spending grow automatically
the budget_office say that by 2023 the annual deficit would rise to an_estimate 3.5 percent of the g.d.p. which be just beyond the level that many economist consider sustainable in a grow economy
by 2038 it would be 6.5 percent
under a nine year plan start in the 2011 fiscal_year discretionary spending be already be reduce annually
but the across the board sequester that take effect in march when republicans and mr._obama could_not agree on alternative deficit reduction have par domestic and military program further result in increase layoff furlough and service cutback
republicans have support keep the sequestration cut in place rather_than accept mr._obama 's proposal for a mix of high tax on wealthy people and some corporation and cut in future entitlement spending
and he have say he will not accept their alternative for deep reduction in medicare and medicaid without tax increase
federal spending for the major health program and social_security will equal 14 percent of the g.d.p. in 25_year double the level of the last four_decade the budget_office project
while federal revenue be project to grow to 19.5 percent of the g.d.p. by 2038 compare_with the 40-year average of 17.5 percent that rise be not enough to offset the spending for federal benefit program
in contrast with entitlement spending discretionary spending for domestic and military program by 2023 would fall to 5.3 percent of the g.d.p. from the 7.3 percent of this_year the low_level in about 70 year
unless substantial change be make to the major health_care program and social_security the report say those program will absorb a much large share of the economy 's total output in the future than they have in the past

london sophie hulme_'s new muse be the frog
for spring/summ 2014 the british handbag designer be inspire_by the plastic jumping frog find in christmas cracker and the dazzling color and pattern of deadly frog native to the rain forest
that may not sound_like the beginning of a collection from a serious fashion business but ms._hulme 's handbag with their quirky charm and staunchly anti logo stance have quickly gain an international following
her label introduce in_january 2009 include ready to wear accessory and jewelry but it be her handbag that she be best_know for and that be see increase demand
in the last_year her full_time staff have grow from one person to 11 give the london bear designer the capacity to make the leap from sell to niche boutique to stock international heavyweight like selfridges harvey nichols barneys saks lane crawford tsum and net a porter
the bag themselves be minimalist but instantly recognizable by their distinctive gold color hardware and tongue in cheek brass charm
design have include a referee 's whistle a bubble blow wand and a fish and chip fork
ms._hulme 's success lie in her ability_to combine a
slick international aesthetic with an exaggerated british style say sasha sarokin net a porter 's international accessory manager
the online retailer first stock ms._hulme 's tote and shoulder bag in early 2012 and they have show a sharp and unfaltering upward swing in sale across all territory she_say
she be one of the first new handbag brand that i have see to take a supremely sophisticated aesthetic and sell it at a price point that be jaw droppingly low ms. sarokin continue
when the average designer handbag cost_$ 1,500 or more ms._hulme 's design be $ 450 to $ 950 a range that reflect a consider business strategy
i give price a_lot of thought she_say
i_think there be a big gap where brand like miu miu and mulberry use to sit
she source material and hardware from italy but produce the handbag in hungary to keep price down
there be definitely a void for premium contemporary designer handbag that be high in design element at a competitive price point say irene yu divisional merchandise manager of footwear and handbag at pedder group whose company stock ms._hulme 's handbag at its stand alone
on pedder accessory store across asia as_well as in the accessory department that the company operate at lane crawford and joyce
british designer have a special talent in design handbag that stand_out but also feel_like instant update classic say maria dueã±as jacobs accessory director of elle magazine in the united_states
designer such as anya hindmarch emma hill and charlotte olympia have a special way of balance luxury and charm without compromise on quality and sophie fit with this approach
in 2012 mulberry 's chief_executive bruno guillon a former managing director at hermã¨s oversee a price increase of the brand 's exist handbag style and the introduction of more bag price at more_than $_1,500
while the mulberry brand 's bag style like the bayswater and alexa continue to be popular the decision to shift away_from affordable luxury clearly have make mulberry 's product less accessible to the average consumer
ms. sarokin say that ms._hulme 's brand do_not simply fill the gap leave by mulberry 's shift in strategy
i_think sophie 's brand sit_next to mulberry rather_than replace it she ' more edgy
the mum and daughter would both wear a bayswater but with sophie it_' more_likely the daughter who will buy into the brand she_say
unlike mulberry ms._hulme have take an understated approach to marketing partly_because of financial necessity and partly_because taste have change
she have not stag runway show because she_say i_want people to buy my design because the product be beautiful and timeless object in their_own right and not because_they buy into a vision that only exist on the catwalk
the it bag a term coin in the 1990 when logo dictate desirability have be overtake in recent_year
ms. yu say that her customer prioritize an emphasis_on the quality of leather design and functionality over the logo
even when it come to brand with champion logo like gucci and fendi it_' the logo free version that sell better ms. sarokin say add this be a trend that be happen internationally include place like russia and the far east
a new generation of british handbag label have a similar approach include fleet ilya danielle foster and golden lane as do international label like kara and mansur gavriel
ms._hulme say that she be aware of the danger that the middle price market could become saturated and she have respond by sell through premium retailer and by sharpen focus_on her ready to wear collection which have increase to 110 piece for spring 2014 from 30 piece for spring 2013
she also have be contemplate new category and will be introduce sunglass next_year
the handbag be important but they can_not be everything ms._hulme say
the brand i admire have a clear vision that work across category
i just need to take it slowly so that i get it right
in 1987 shortly_after i turn 8 i begin to lobby my_parent for a chance to play tackle football
my_father be the coach of a high_school freshman team so in a way i have be raise around the game
because of my age my_parent have reservation but they agree to attend an open house with the man_who would be coach the pop warner team
afterward my_parent still be not convince
what persuade them
accord_to my_father i walk to the car in tear head down mumble about how i would never get to play_football
two month_later i be experience drill like bull in the ring in which a player be surround_by teammate who repeatedly rush at him
crack skull as they use to say
it be tackle football
and i_love it
for much of my playing career most parent with young_child who play_football be most interested_in my workout regimen and what supplement i be take
those conversation have shift significantly in the last_few year
now the most_common question by far be would you let your son play_football
my response be usually a resounding no
right around the time those question start i develop a deep love hate relationship_with the game
i_love play on sundays
i_love the paycheck
i_love the guy in the locker_room
but i hat what football be do to so_many people around me and i hat what it be probably do to me
there seem to be red_flag everywhere and even_if i could_not state with certainty that the game cause each and every ailment that so_many of my_friend be experience the evidence be mount quickly
i find_myself receive e_mail after e_mail from people presumably motivate by keyword search_for football concussion trauma disease
every new study draw a correlation between head injury and postcareer brain disease would find its way to my in box almost daily
combine that with phone_call from former teammate who be struggle and the headline of yet_another fall former player and i begin to hate the game
but be this merely an_emotional reaction and not_necessarily an accurate reflection of an otherwise incredible football journey that span decade
perhaps
first of all i do_not even have a son so it be probably a bit ridiculous for me to speculate
i_realize there be girl who play_football but my_daughter do_not have any interest and i have no idea how i would respond to an 8-year old_boy beg me to play this game
second football give_me so_much
how can i bash a game that produce so_many friendship pay for part_of my education and help me become comfortable financially
and third football be safe than it have ever be right
right
i honestly have no idea how to answer that question
sure training_camp be easy than it use to be and everyone be smart about limit in practice contact
but once the game start football be football
and nothing be ever go to change that unless you drastically change the game
i be no expert in physic but there_' no_doubt n.f.l. player be big faster and strong than they have ever be
as a result there be more velocity at the point of contact than there have ever be
i hate to say it but no head up campaign or the threat of a penalty or a fine will reduce football 's inherent violence
the late dark reminder come monday when a 16-year old high_school player from brocton n.y. die after a helmet to helmet hit in a game friday_night
certainly there be lesson to be learn from play_football about toughness battle through adversity and teamwork
but i do_not think football be the only way to teach those
i have numerous friend who never play_football but who have battle through fail bar exam medical residency and struggle business and who be just as successful as i be
in truth they be probably a_lot more well adjust well balanced and better position to navigate life 's speed bump than i will ever be
maybe they never have to push through pain and mask injury the way i have but be that really a virtue
still now that i be retire from football i know now more_than ever that i absolutely love play the game
and now i actually get pay to talk_about football on television
imagine the hypocrisy
here i be question_whether child should be play the game at all and i be basically sell the game to child watch at home
there_' certainly some internal conflict with that
and just because football work out well for me that do_not mean it will work out well for everyone
the odds be just too daunting
so maybe the more appropriate question be if i could do it all over again would i
the answer absolutely
without hesitation
i recently ask my_parent the same question separately know_what you_know now
would you have say yes after that meeting over 25_year ago
my_mother without hesitation no it_' just not worth the risk
we have love be on this journey with you and it_' bring us so_much joy but i would rather see you live a long and healthy life
my_father the former football coach after a long hesitation yes but i would not let you start so soon
he_add football be not for everyone scott
he ' right
it_' not for everyone
but it be definitely for me
and it be definitely for a_lot of other people too
so just because i be tear about the game it_' not my responsibility to make other parent decision for them
but i do feel an obligation to inform them
i be a former player now and concerned parent continue to ask_me scott would you let your son play_football
and how do i respond
i_'m just glad i have three daughter and will never have that conversation
scott fujita be an n.f.l. linebacker from 2002 to 2012
london lightness in both fabric and color have be a theme of the london season
peter pilotto the label that be the joint work of the namesake designer and christopher de vos will_soon be light in a different sense on the purse string
a specially conceive collection for the u.s. retail chain target will be introduce feb. 9 news that the duo flash up in neon letter on the catwalk
maybe it be look through their not so old archive that make the collection look_like peter pilotto 's great hit the familiar vivid color in digital pattern and especially the full bouncy skirt that other designer of their generation be leave_behind
thomas tait 's show on_tuesday start as a light white story to a fault even_if the clean line and single color be finally challenge by the interjection of bright graphic line at the neck in green orange and turquoise
mr. tait have a clean sleek way with minimalism
and consider the searing color and pattern on the london scene this quiet be refreshing
yet among the blush pink silver dress and coral and white coat there be not_quite enough insertion of unexpected fabric or texture which would have make the collection take off
giles deacon like all good designer know_how to step out of the box that contain his_own heritage
his giles collection be less historical more modernist with his blow_up pattern of the face of the model kate moss and amber valletta on simple short or long dress
there be a darkness to the collection in both its color and its spirit enhance by giles as he be know use his prefer setting of an old hogwarts style great hall
bat not in the belfry but as witchy black hat add to the dark spirit
the chinese designer huishan zhang explain_how each line of airy square that make up the lean line dress or slender stop and skirt in his collection be measure piece by piece in his studio as if it be a mathematics class
the result could best be define as pretty precision with color like coral for a tunic over pant and with black piece transform by mesh lace and those translucent square
the designer 's inspiration
madeleine vionnet and her couture technique and the skill learn from his training at central saint martins college of arts and design in london
the work do by the italian designer massimo nicosia at pringle of scotland be impressive with so_many different technique of classic knit and modernize macrame
outstanding be the broken diamond take an age old pattern but shake it into the 21st_century
british heritage collection be increasingly about add new skill in the spirit of the old

this process may use ingredient like egg white or isinglass derive_from fish bladder to remove minute particle from the wine
these fin agent be then remove but trace element may remain rule out the wine for vegan
how can you tell if a wine be vegan
some wine may not be fin or may be fin with a clay base ingredient like bentonite
but it be difficult to know for sure unless a wine be label unfined or include an ingredient list
few wine list ingredient but producer like ridge bonny doon vineyard and shinn estate be lead the way
and their wine be very good.â

president_obama speak with ms._rousseff by_telephone for 20_minute on_monday night but fail to persuade her to go_through with the visit which have be schedule for late october
a series of news_report about n.s.a. spy in brazil have clearly irk ms._rousseff in recent_week and her government demand a full explanation from washington
vice_president joseph r. biden jr. have call ms._rousseff to try_to ease tension over the spying revelation and secretary of state_john kerry travel to brazil to discuss the matter with official in brasã­lia publicly criticize his explanation as unsatisfactory
susan e. rice mr._obama 's national_security adviser say last_week that report about the n.s.a. 's activity in brazil have raise legitimate question a statement fall_short of brazil_'s expectation
washington do_not do contrition very well say julia e. sweig director for latin american study at the council on foreign_relations emphasize how the relationship between united_states and brazil be still not strong enough to withstand the turmoil over the n.s.a. revelation
the white_house insist in a statement on_tuesday that the broad relationship between brazil and the united_states should not be overshadow by a single bilateral issue no_matter how important or challenge the issue may be
for that reason the statement say mr._obama and ms._rousseff agree to postpone the visit to an undetermined time
in_addition to their telephone conversation on_monday night ms._rousseff and mr._obama have discuss the n.s.a. revelation during the meeting of group of 20 leader in st. petersburg russia this_month the white_house point_out
the president have say that he understand and regret the concern that disclosure of alleged u.s. intelligence activity have generate in brazil and make_clear that he be commit to work together with president rousseff and her government in diplomatic channel to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship the statement say
the white_house also say that a broad review of the american intelligence posture would take several_month to complete and that the leader have agree that the visit should be delay until the spying issue be resolve
meanwhile while commerce be still thrive between brazil and the united_states business leader and trade expert in both country be try_to gauge how put the visit off would affect effort to bolster tie
it_' simply disappointing to see this turn in policy say christian lohbauer a political scientist at the university of sã£o paulo who have represent brazilian exporter of orange juice
the diplomatic agenda should be focus_on what ' practical for both nation which in brazil_'s case be develop its economy through strong relation with a country like the united_states
but even before ms._rousseff 's announcement expectation be low for the concrete result of the state visit
no major trade agreement be anticipate and washington have refrain_from explicitly support brazil_'s bid for a permanent seat on the united_nations security_council as mr._obama do for india in_2010
ahead of 2014 election ms._rousseff stand to gain among some element within the govern workers party by meet their demand for a strong response on the spying issue but political_analyst here point_out that brazil_'s move be still relatively mild and avoid the expulsion of united_states diplomat or limit on investment by american company
it_' a friction point in relation but not a breakup say geraldo zahran a specialist on brazil_'s tie with the united_states at pontifical catholic university in sã£o paulo
still others assail washington 's response to brazil in the face of grow ire over the espionage revelation report of which have be televise nationally for week
as resentment fester in brasã­lia the obama_administration seem to put the tension with brazil on the back burner focus_on other issue like syria
the inaction in the face of such an overreach have prove costly say michael shifter president of the inter american dialogue a washington policy group about the administration_'s effort to offset the damage cause_by the spying
washington would be wise to_reflect on what this mean for its most crucial diplomatic effort in this hemisphere
michael d. shear contribute_report from washington
if_you follow my summer road trip from baton rouge la. to fargo n.d. you may have wonder how i get from new_york to my start point in the first place
i drive 20 hour
alone
it be far cheap than fly into louisiana then have to rend a car pay a huge drop off fee in north dakota and fly home
i have hop for company to split both the driving and $ 175 or so in ga and toll
so about a week before my trip i post my route on three ride share site zimride.com erideshare.com and ridester.com
and get not a peep
with economic pressure push traveler to share resource whenever possible and various online service make that ever easier i wonder how this be possible
do i do something wrong
be the site inadequate
or be there simply not enough people out there look for such a ride
the answer turn_out to be a bit of each
ride sharing 's move from campus bulletin board to internet have be less successful than expect
and though it_' still a potential moneysaver for traveler that ' mostly for distance easily cover in a day
so what could i have do better
my first mistake not post everywhere i should have
i do the right thing by list my ride at no charge on the site mention above
but i miss the big player in the game crusty old craigslist
sure it lack map or calendar or user profile or review or a way to pay in advance by credit_card and not incidentally there_' little recourse if thing go wrong
but it have the ride more and more widespread at_least base_on my unscientific survey than the other site
luckily the second big number of listing seem to be on the most user friendly site zimride
the process for list and book ride be roughly similar to that for room on airbnb.com although zimride do_not take a cut so you_can choose between book online or contact the driver directly to make arrangement
other great feature its profile be facebook connect mean you_can do a little online research into your potential travel partner and its algorithm often match people with different but potentially overlapping route
for_example it may have find me someone_who be go from baltimore to atlanta a nice chunk of my journey
in_july zimride be buy by enterprise holdings know mostly for its car rental company
but accord_to a spokeswoman laura bryant they have no plan to change anything
that seem_like a smart move to me even more so now that i have speak to several zimride user i contact at random through the site
they be all enthusiastic user who have save money though the site do_not stand on its_own even for them they have all find it necessary to find rider on craigslist
they be a diverse bunch
fabio vargas 29 travel most weekend between his home in tallahassee and orlando fla. to visit his_family and girlfriend and take along fellow rider when he can he charge $_25 per passenger and calculate his annual saving at $ 1,300
paul orsett a 50-year old public school teacher from outside raleigh n.c. have use ride share to save on trip across the country
julia lipianskaya 23 a recent college graduate_from palo alto calif. use to scramble to find friend to share the driving and ga cost to visit her family in the bay area until she find zimride in her senior year and start occasionally even turn a profit on her trip
all three take measure to reduce their risk vet potential rider online through facebook and google and have occasionally reject some
mr. orsett say passenger often vet him as_well like me he ' in the prime potential creep age range
he point them to the web_site of a local news station that feature him as teacher of the week
ms. lipianskaya originally take only woman passenger but gradually loosen her policy especially if she click over from zimride to the potential passenger 's facebook profile and find mutual friend
as a young_woman travel alone it_' a little nerve racking sometimes she_say
but i have not have any bad experience
i just always bring pepper spray
i hope i never have to use it
if_you think this all sound_like too_much work and risk consider try a canadian and european service when go abroad
it turn_out that the united_states be way behind other country in long distance ride sharing
we_'re do better with intracity ride sharing and taxilike service like lyft uber and sidecar
just across the border in canada kangaride.com appear to be boom
it have a slick interface and have about 5,000 ride post per week both zimride and craigslist decline to provide number include some between montreal and new_york or boston
the trade off be that kangaride charge a yearly membership fee of 7.50 canadian_dollar about the same in american dollar and charge passenger a 5 dollar fee per ride
but that money go toward a staff of 25 which check driver record under an agreement with several provincial government and monitor new member by follow up with their passenger after trip
the site function for trip within the united_states as_well but it be not yet widely use
as of now we_'re focus our marketing effort on canada say robin grantner kangaride 's communication coordinator
but we would love to expand
let_'s hope
traveler to europe may also consider look for ride online before they book expensive train ticket or plan to suffer the indignity of low cost airline
the german site carpooling.com have around 30 driver offer ride between berlin and munich each weekend average 30 euro about_$ 38 at $ 1.28 to the euro a fraction of the train fare and also work across europe
in britain the big success story be liftshare.com which currently claim around 37,000 long distance ride list
people join up because_they 're_go to save half their travel cost or more say ali clabburn the site 's founder
but they come_back again because_they love the social side of it
mr. clabburn add that one in 100 briton have sign up and that despite 100,000 people share car every_day they have never have a reported safety incident
as for my return trip from fargo
i persuade two old friend to fly out to meet me for the drive home which relieve me of the drive responsibility but not the ga cost
next road trip i will post smart and wide
or just go to canada

matt harvey 's right elbow feel fine tuesday
he do_not have the numbness the tingling the shooting pain often associate_with elbow issue
he do_not feel any pain
last_month when his forearm feel tender and the discomfort grow bad he report it to the mets medical staff and be find to have a partly tear ulnar collateral ligament
it be suggest_that he may need surgery
on_tuesday the day_after he receive a second opinion from dr. james andrews a note orthopedist it be announce that harvey would not have tommy_john surgery
instead he will undertake a structured rehabilitation program outline by andrews that will last about six to eight week
however if the forearm trouble return if he have numbness tingle or shoot pain harvey concede that something need to get do
surgery would be necessary and keep him out for about a year
harvey say he would rather bet on himself rehabilitate the elbow than have the surgery to be safe
he note how andrews have test the elbow and find nothing be move in place it should n't
harvey add he believe_that it be very stable
when harvey 's injury be discover after he allow 13 hit in a loss to the detroit tigers in late_august general_manager sandy alderson indicate_that harvey should have surgery and not attempt_to pitch be hurt later and potentially miss time in 2015
alderson who sit_next to harvey at tuesday 's news_conference say that surgery be still an option
i_think there_' some ambiguity at this point and maybe through the next couple of month alderson say add that he want_to see how harvey respond to rehab
alderson point to the mets glut of young pitching indicate he be not worried_about replace harvey for 2014 even_if his status remain uncertain
for now though the possibility remain that harvey can pitch open day in 2014
the throw program will be outline in the come day alderson say
we_'re all go to be watch each and every little step he take
mets manager terry collins_say add we_'re all behind_him and he know that
harvey have a sensational season
on three occasion he flirt with a no hitter or a perfect game
his fastball be a blur
his slider snap away_from bat
in 26 game he have a 2.27 earn_run average
he start the all_star game for the national_league at citi_field and it be as if the mets star be on display for all the game to see
he pitch two scoreless inning
he strike_out two premier slugger miguel cabrera and jose bautista swing on filthy slider and adam jones swing on a 98 mile_per hour fastball
his fame grow
he make television appearance and magazine cover
he have perhaps just as much as david wright become the face of the mets
and the mets have plan to protect him hold him to 215 inning this_year or maybe few between 200 and 205
he have nearly reach 180 inning when he be sideline
now if harvey go_through the throwing program with no problem the mets will surely do their best to protect harvey and his elbow and treat it with utmost importance
inside pitch david wright strain hamstring could return this_weekend against philadelphia at the earliest terry collins_say
by then there will be at most 10 game leave this_season

among the most troubling question face consumer as they shop for insurance under the obama_administration 's new health_care law be whether the plan will cover the drug they take and how_much they will have to pay for them
but with less_than two week remain until enrollment open on_oct. 1 the answer be still elusive and anxiety be grow for consumer whose well be depend_on expensive medication
state run the marketplace where the plan will be offer have not release detail about which drug will be cover
insurer have say little about how_much consumer will be ask to contribute or what type_of restriction will be place on certain medicine
of the few state that have reveal specific some have plan that will require patient to contribute as much as 50_percent of the cost of the most expensive drug
i_'ve get to be honest and say i be a little_bit nervous say jessica thomas a mental_health counselor in north_carolina who take the drug tecfidera to treat her multiple_sclerosis
ms. thomas 34 have be enrol for two_year in a program for people with expensive medical condition that be run by north_carolina
but that program be end in december and she must select a new plan in the state marketplace
at the top of her mind be how_much she will have to pay for tecfidera which cost more_than $ 4,000 a month
i_think that ' the hard thing right_now be that it_' the unknown decide what the financial cost will be she_say
the picture will not get immediately_clear once enrollment begin
without a central hub for evaluate drug coverage patient advocacy_group say they be already warn their member to prepare_for a tedious slog through web_site download record and phone_call to customer_service hot line
i have frankly expect a high_level of transparency by this point say brian rosen the senior_vice president for government and public affair at the leukemia and lymphoma society
insurer and official in the obama_administration be counsel patience say consumer will have six_month once enrollment open to choose a plan that be right for them
the administration assert that chronically ill patient be among the big beneficiary of the new law give that insurer be now prevent from deny them coverage and can_not charge them high premium because of their illness
for many americans these change will mean that a diagnosis no_longer mean choose between face bankruptcy or ignore care say erin shields britt a spokeswoman_for the department of health and human services
others say some initial uncertainty and even confusion be to be expect
i_think you have to walk before you_can run say karen ignagni president and chief_executive of america_'s health_insurance plans an industry trade group
this be a massive undertaking
the plan offer in the marketplace must cover a minimum number of drug in every treatment category with the exact count set by a representative commercial plan know as a benchmark plan that be designate in each state
oregon virginia connecticut and other state plan to cover more_than 97 percent of drug while others like maryland colorado and california plan to cover 54 to 84 percent accord_to an analysis by avalere health a consult firm
patient can lobby for an exception if_they can demonstrate that a drug not cover by their plan be medically necessary
but how_many drug will be offer under the plan be only a starting point
perhaps more significant be how_much patient will be ask to contribute toward the cost of those drug
only a handful_of state have release those detail but advocate for patient with chronic disease and those in the drug industry say they be trouble by what they have see so_far 1_2 next_page
amc be have a hard time separate from its hit series
on_tuesday the network announce that instead of a final_season of mad_men as be plan for next_spring the much acclaimed series will divide in two push off the finale for another year
a day earlier the network announce it would spin off a new series from its hit zombie show
the walking dead and last_week it make a deal to spin off a show from break_bad
in the case of mad_men amc be follow the strategy it take with break_bad in divide up a plan final_season into two installment and it will be wait a full year between seven episode arc
that mean the final_season be really two entirely separate one at_least in term of scheduling
the first seven show will be show next_spring under the title the beginning
the second group will be show in 2015 and will be call the end of an era variety report that the write staff for the final_season will include the oscar win screenwriter robert towne who will be designate a consulting producer
the show 's creator matthew weiner will shoot all the episode in one production cycle so in effect amc will simply be store away the last seven episode for a year
the decision seem to underscore amc 's concern_about lose its two original blockbuster drama within a year of each_other
the network shatter almost_every television precedent by develop and show two prominent and highly successful television drama over the same_time span
break_bad be end in two week in a flurry of rapturous praise
mad_men be schedule to conclude next_spring
that would have leave amc with only the walking dead as a breakout hit
its other current drama hell on wheels and this_year 's low winter sun have not remotely approach the level of success that break_bad or mad man do
amc cancel the killing for a second time earlier_this month
so the network will now get two more chance instead of one to try_to introduce new show use mad_men as a springboard
but in do so it will ask more patience from the show 's fan
the one benefit be the addition of one episode beyond what have be originally plan
in a statement mr. weiner say we plan to take_advantage of this chance to have a more elaborate story tell in two part which can resonate a little_bit longer in the mind of our audience

it be clear that petke be more_concerned with what his player do rather_than what they say
the coach 's man have win three straight game in major_league soccer and be alone in first place in the eastern conference with five regular_season match leave to play
in his rookie season as the team 's head coach petke acknowledge_that the most difficult transition have be in deal_with player management massage ego and pick the right spot to speak to his player
the league have change there be more team more player more personality he say
and you also throw in all that social_medium stuff the player be under a microscope and they be get critique at all angle
it make the player a little more touchy
they ask_why they_'re not start because it_' all over facebook mlssoccer.com and twitter
it_' blow_up
i call it the lebron syndrome after lebron james

you look around our league and there be some who would rather that than to earn it and when thing do_not fall their way it_' a touchy situation

when consider backup power for mobile device consumer typically have two choice a portable battery that can charge multiple device or a charge case which be more convenient but usually work with only a single device
innovative technology a maker of gadget accessory think consumer should have both
the company 's justin power case which be design for the ipad have a build in battery that can charge the ipad and other gadget include io android and blackberry device at the same_time
the company say the rechargeable battery in the justin case can charge an ipad twice or an iphone seven time on a single charge
that high capacity battery make the case ideal for traveler and others who use their device for long period
charge be a little slow however
it take me a few_hour to fully charge my ipad a bit longer than the process take with a wall charger
four tiny led inside the cover let you_know how_much charge the case have leave
the synthetic leather exterior of the justin case be not particularly handsome but it_' durable and offer good protection and a nice grip
the ipad slide easily into the case through an interior opening near the hinge and a magnetic flap keep it securely in place
an integrated kickstand can be use to prop up the ipad in portrait mode
the trade off however be that the case be bulky double the thickness of the ipad even with the ultra slim model
and the case do_not activate ipad 's automatic shut off when the cover be close
the justin case come with a micro usb cord and a wall adapter for charge but not a cord with a 30-pin connector to attach to the ipad which would have help immensely
still at $ 70 the justin case provide a long last power backup at a decent price
thrust back into a central role in resolve the syrian conflict the five permanent member of the united_nations security_council meet on_tuesday to negotiate a draft resolution that would hold syria to its pledge of identify all chemical_weapon under government control for destruction but diplomat say major difference over a draft quickly emerge
the diplomat who decline to be identify say russia syria_'s most_important ally be resist component of the draft compose by the three western permanent member britain france and the united_states that discuss the threat of force to ensure syrian compliance whether to condemn the syrian_government for chemical_weapon use and whether suspect user should be refer_to the international_criminal court for war_crime prosecution
the discussion be unlikely to produce a quick resolution the diplomat say and it be unclear when a draft will be ready for a vote
renew momentum for security_council action get a boost from a framework_agreement reach on_saturday between the united_states and russia under which the council would review syria_'s compliance with the chemical weapons convention which the country officially agree to join that same day
under the framework_agreement the syrians be expect to submit by saturday a comprehensive listing of all their chemical_weapon supply and facility as a first step with the goal of identify and destroy the munition by the middle of 2014
the agreement also specify that the security_council should review syrian compliance with the rule of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the hague base group that administer the treaty
representative of the council 's permanent member meet a day_after a united_nations panel of weapon inspector confirm that a devastating chemical_weapon attack have be carry_out near damascus the syrian capital on_aug. 21
their report the first independent on the ground inquest into that attack do_not ascribe blame
but nonproliferation expert say the litany of specific evidence present appear to implicate the government of president_bashar al_assad
the syrian_government have say insurgent carry_out the attack in which hundred_of civilian be kill by exposure to sarin a chemical nerve agent
russia have support the syrian_government 's assertion argue_that it be illogical that syrian force could have be responsible
secretary_general ban ki moon who call the report a chilling document that describe a war_crime decline at a united_nations news_conference on_tuesday to ascribe responsibility for that attack a position he have consistently hold
but mr. ban express hope that the russia united_states agreement reach saturday negotiate by foreign_minister sergey_v. lavrov of russia and secretary of state_john kerry have set in motion a diplomatic process that would overcome the division that have deadlocked the security_council over syria since the conflict there begin 30 month_ago
what be encourage be that the two foreign_minister agree on a framework_agreement how to deal_with all_these chemical_weapon mr. ban say
i hope that spirit of very friendly negotiation on the basis of good rapport will help forge a unity among the security_council
he also express hope that any security_council resolution on syria can really be an enforceable one
the russia united_states agreement specify that if syria fail to comply_with its obligation under the chemical_weapon treaty the security_council should impose measure under chapter 7 of the united_nations charter which allow for coercive step include the use of military force
but differ interpretation of that passage have emerge among the permanent member of the security_council over the past_few day
diplomat say russia want chapter 7 mention as one of the option available to the council at a future date open the possibility that a further resolution would be need if syrian noncompliance become an issue
britain france and the united_states on the other_hand want the resolution language to convey the threat of chapter 7 action immediately in keep with their publicly state position that syria can_not delay or dodge its obligation
france and the united_states have also say they reserve the right to punish syria militarily a position criticize by russia as illegal under the united_nations charter
the united_states ambassador samantha power on_tuesday invoke the detail provide in the chemical_weapon report to press the argument that accountability and enforceability must be part_of any security_council resolution on syria grow out of the aug._21 attack the deadly use of chemical_weapon since saddam hussein 's force gas the kurdish village of halabja in 1988
for a crime of this magnitude it be not enough to say chemical_weapon be use any more_than it would have be enough to say that machete be use in rwanda in 1994 she_say in remark to a general_assembly session on the chemical_weapon report
we_must condemn the user and here we_must acknowledge what the technical detail of the u.n. report make_clear only the regime could have carry_out this large_scale chemical_weapon attack the large attack in 25_year
the differing view be reflect earlier tuesday in a moscow meeting between mr._lavrov and france 's foreign_minister laurent fabius
mr._lavrov be quote as say the agreement with the united_states have make_clear that if syria be noncompliant then the security_council will examine the situation
mr._lavrov also dispute the conclusion draw by his western colleague from the chemical_weapon report
while mr._fabius say at a news_conference that the report expose the regime mr._lavrov say his government have serious reason to suggest_that this be a provocation carry_out by insurgent seek mr._assad 's demise

what a cad i use to be constantly ditch the bistro that have open only four month_ago for the week old trattoria with an even dewy complexion callously trade in the yellowtail sashimi that have be so good to me for a hot tamale of unproven charm
then a few_year back the restaurant barbuto and i settle down
it_' bliss
she know my_heart know my drill a gin martini to begin a seasonal salad for my appetizer the roasted chicken after
and i know her
if the weather 's nice a breeze will blow in from the west_village street that her retractable wall open onto
the kale that she serve me will be sparingly dress
and the breast meat
as plump and tender as it be the last time around and the dozen time before that
we do_not have firework not this late in the game
but we have a rhythm
sometimes that ' better
what i be say be that i be a regular there as i be at the breslin whose lamb burger be as true to me as i be to it at empellã³n taqueria where i never stray from the fish tempura taco which never let_me down at szechuan gourmet where i do_not glance at a menu
i do_not have to
i be no monogamist that ' clear
more of a polygamist
but i dote on my sister wife
i have come to see that the broccolini be not always green on the other side of houston street and i be here to sing what ' too seldom sung the joy of familiarity
the pleasure of intimacy
the virtue of stay put
what you have with a restaurant that you visit once or twice be a transaction
what you have with a restaurant that you visit over and over be a relationship
the fashionable script for today 's food maven do_not encourage that sort_of bonding especially not in a city with new_york 's ambition and inexhaustible variety
here you_'re suppose_to dash to the new andrew carmellini brasserie before anybody else get there be the first to taste abc cocina 's guacamole advertise an opinion about the massaman curry at uncle boons while others be still puzzle over the fugitive apostrophe
snap a photo
tweet it
then move on
there_' always something else
always virgin ground
for year i be dedicate to explore it by dint of my duty as the times 's restaurant critic
i be a pay philanderer
it be exhilarating
it be exhaust
and it be not_necessarily the best course
i would think back to my pre critic day in rome and to the handful_of restaurant i keep circle around to
the server and owner there would exult when i walk through the door because_they understand how to make me happy and they could have a conversation with me different from the one they have with newcomer a conversation build on share history and reciprocal trust a dialogue between honest to goodness friend
i be not special
but i be special to them
i would think too of my food love father 's approach to din out
when he find a place with a few dish and a few server he adore and when those server reciprocate his affection he stop look around
call off the search
he understand_what i have relearn these last_few year with barbuto and the others the smile you get from host hostess and bartender who know you be entirely unlike the smile from one who be just meet you
they_'re less theatrical less stilted warm by countless degree
regular matter to a restaurant
though the newcomer draw there by review or yelp chatter can keep it pack for a while the familiar face help it go the distance
that '_why some of those fusty pricey italian haunt on the upper_east side outlast the trend conscious effort of this top chef alumnus or that darling of the culinary scribe
they have put extra energy into cultivate a steady clientele turn themselves into club into tribe
it_' the only way to do it say robert bohr one of the owner of the new restaurant charlie bird in soho which be design as be barbuto and so_many other restaurant in that general area of downtown manhattan to be a repeat refuge for neighborhood folk who like to drop in impulsively
a few table be informally tag for such walk in as they_'re call in the business and the menu accommodate snack as_well as feasting
mr. bohr say that he have work at what he call destination restaurant and that while first- and second timer may keep them hum at peak hour during peak stretch it_' regular who support you on off day in bad weather during time of the night that be not prime_time
in return regular at most restaurant get extra consideration a glass of sparkle wine that be not ask for a dessert that just appear a promotion to the head of the waiting list when the place be full
there_' a practical unemotional reason to join the frequent flier club
perk accrue
mr. bohr note_that you_can make request of a restaurant where you_'re a regular that you would never make and that may not be indulge elsewhere
because he have lunch as often as once a week at abc kitchen he can place his order the second he sit_down and say i_want to be out in 25 minute
they_'re welcome to that he say because he ' be loyal and he will be back 1_2 next_page

i_'m tired of be funny say eva the los_angeles massage therapist whose midlife travail be the subject of enough said a small miracle of a movie write and direct_by nicole holofcener
it be possible to sympathize with eva and also to marvel_at her curious sense of timing
happily or at_least not miserably divorce with nice friend and a gratifyingly nondysfunctional teenage daughter eva play by the reliably hilarious julia louis dreyfus use her sense of humor as a social tool and an_emotional defense
she ' a good sport a designate joker which be fine except that it mean that she never have to be take seriously even by herself
but as she roll over in the bed she have just share for the first_time with albert james gandolfini also the divorce parent of a girl soon to leave for college eva sense another possibility
this guy whom she meet at a party and recently start date may actually get her not just her joke
he agreeably and gallantly say that he ' also tired of be funny
but you_'re not funny she_say as they snuggle against each_other laugh at her_own quick wit and also pay him a sincere if somewhat backhanded compliment
now be the time to state that enough said be very funny indeed
line for line scene for scene it be one of the best write american film comedy in recent memory and an implicit rebuke to the raunchy sloppy spectacle of immaturity that have dominate the genre in recent_year
this be not to say that ms._holofcener an acute observer of the manner and moral of the self satisfied metropolitan middle_class west_coast division be decorous or genteel
she be rather almost ruthless in her attention to the petty vanity and hypocrisy of her character and the way their relatively privileged circumstance lead them to weave web of guilt complacency and stifle aggression
and yet it be also clear that ms._holofcener like them even or especially when they be ridiculous myopic or mean
this have be apparent in all of her feature so_far from walk and talk 1996 through lovely and amazing 2002
friend with money 2006 and please give 2010
their only real flaw be scarcity
ideally ms._holofcener would be_able to work at a woody allen pace issue annual bulletin from the life of people_who after 15 or 20_minute already seem_like your friend
in other_word they be exasperating and difficult as_well as lovable
ms. louis dreyfus be memorably describe in her seinfeld persona as a pretty woman with a face like a frying pan
that face have mature into a remarkably expressive instrument
eva be like no other movie character i have ever see and uncannily like a_lot of real woman i know
motherhood on the big screen be typically view with pity sentimentality or resentment and romantic love tend_to be treat in a similarly reductive manner as an impossible dream or a state of earthly bliss
ms. louis dreyfus and ms._holofcener know better and they approach eva 's emotional adventure as mother lover and friend as a series of practical and ethical challenge
her relationship_with albert and with her_daughter ellen the wonderfully sensitive tracey fairaway be each complicate by a third person whose presence at first seem benign or irrelevant
eva 's closeness to ellen 's needy best_friend chloe tavi gevinson provoke some jealousy as ellen prepare to leave home
meanwhile she have acquire a new client and friend marianne catherine keener a poet with exquisite taste and an aura of high bohemian glamour who happen to be albert 's former wife
the real genius of enough said be that it take this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlock both its farcical potential and its latent profundity
what_happen when the thing that you once find charming start drive you crazy
many love story address that question but ms._holofcener tilt it a few degree
do it matter that the thing about albert that eva find charming drive marianne crazy
should it
if_you want_to take the measure of ignacio mattos 's cooking at estela which open on east houston street in_june you may look_at the burrata on the menu and think no too easy
anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start
but order it anyway so you_can see what_happen when mr._mattos put this louche voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse
the burrata sit like whip cream on charred bread
soak into the bread and pool around it be a brooding green liquid press from lovage sorrel celery and other foliage
it look_like something you would force yourself to drink after do very bad_thing to your body ingest it with burrata must be some kind_of preventive medicine the after midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser
that ' not what it feel_like though
when this fatty sprawl of dairy be bring to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice it become something you taste not something that wash over you in a big creamy wave
it_' strange
but it_' right
strange food be often bear from a need to kill boredom ours or the cook 's
it can keep kitchen and dining_room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad
mr._mattos 's cooking at estela have a mild case of weirdness
it be just unfamiliar enough that i have eat about a meal and a half there before it dawn on me that nearly everything be mediterranean more or less
i should have see that one come give that mr._mattos who grow_up in uruguay cook at chez panisse for a year and il buco for five
the cooking be almost familiar but not_quite and it_' the little difference that get under your skin
the flatbread serve with an excellent potato thicken mash of salt cod be a rye matzo
and a whole squid and a spring onion both griddle on a plancha and serve with a reasonably traditional romesco of red pepper and hazelnut look_like a leathery podlike alien creature alongside a blacken stem that snake down the plate
the mild strangeness draw my attention to how deep and elemental the flavor of both dish be
mild strangeness have not always be mr._mattos 's preferred line of attack
when he be the chef at isa in williamsburg brooklyn he revel in deep surrealist weirdness
his best_know dish there be fry sardine skeleton which look as if it belong behind glass at a museum of natural oddity
i remember rattle my jaw on nearly raw grain and get my first taste of sweet potato leaf which until then i have think be poisonous
estela which mr._mattos open with two partner mark connell and a wine guy slash general_manager name thomas carter be far_less confrontational in way that go beyond the kitchen
within two second of climb the step to this spare and intimate little dining_room you_know that there will be a speech on how the menu work that most of the dish will be small that sharing will be encourage that the noise level will climb steeply that the meal will cost more_than the menu price lead you to believe
this be a particular danger if_you be not careful with wine because mr. carter lead us into three digit temptation much_more often than you would expect from a list that ' relatively compact
the dish be not compose of pixel size bit of food that have to be divide by laser surgery they generally share well
this be a good start but then estela like many small plate restaurant neglect the so_call share plate that you actually eat from if_you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serve platter
the share plate at estela be no big than tea saucer and be rarely swap out
one night assorted juice and sauce from eight recipe swirl together before a fresh plate come along
it be like see eight movie project on the same screen at once
new or big plate would help you to focus_on the energetic crackle mr._mattos give beef tartare by fold fry sunchoke chip into the raw meat or the low growl of spice he lend to a fried egg and gigante bean by pair them with bread cube dunk in harissa
ingredient that do_not appear to have be tamper with often have a depth of flavor that take you by surprise
there_' the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding
inside wheel of uncooked summer squash arrange like scale over intensely sweet raw scallop and pureed avocado

after month of contentious behind the scene battle the public may finally get its chance to own a piece of a new_york city landmark the empire_state building
the real_estate family that control the 102-story art deco tower could move ahead as soon as this_week with plan to sell share to the public through a real_estate investment trust or reit.
it could be one of the large initial public_offering ever of such a trust in a deal value at more_than $_5 billion
but even as malkin holdings race forward with the plan offering which include the iconic tower and 18 other office property it operate in new_york city and in stamford conn. prospective buyer for the empire_state building continue to come_out of the woodwork
last_week joseph sitt a new_york city landlord increase his earlier bid
his company thor equities be now propose to buy empire_state building associates which own the land the building and the lease for $ 1.4 billion in cash
that top mr. sitt 's offer from earlier_this summer and be high than the $ 1.18 billion that the entity be value at as part_of the reit. see as this new offer come in above both the appraise and exchange value in the propose reit that lead me to believe they be take it very seriously say jason meister an investment broker with avison young who_represent thor equities
the offer by mr. sitt be the late in a string of unsolicited bid that have be rebuff by peter l. malkin and his son anthony e. malkin who contend that their plan which have_already be approve_by stakeholder be more valuable
furthermore most if not all of the bidder have have communication with richard edelman a stakeholder in the empire_state building who have lead a group of dissident oppose to the plan reit.
that have lead to question_about whether the offer for the building be real or just attempt_to derail the initial public_offering
one of the bid be make on a single sheet of paper and provide no information_about where the buyer would find the money to finance the building 's purchase
additionally mr. meister who_represent mr. sitt at thor be the son of stephen meister a lawyer represent some of the dissident shareholder
this should be a chill the champagne moment for the malkins
family_member who be minority owner of the building have_already win several crucial round in a long run battle with dissident stakeholder
with the public_offering the malkins would be catapult into the upper echelon of manhattan real_estate their stake could be value at an_estimate $ 730 million and provide other legal and tax benefit
anthony malkin would become chairman of a new company empire_state realty trust
in 1961 3,300 unit in the building be sell to stakeholder at $_10,000 a unit with some individual buy multiple unit
after about a year of back and forth the malkins early this_summer persuade the require 80_percent of the building 's roughly 3,000 stakeholder to vote in favor of go public
while the malkins still face a few remain hurdle in their fight with the dissident include a court ruling expect this fall on whether a judge 's ruling on new_york 's limited liability corporation law be legal they be press_ahead with their plan for a public_offering
a spokesman_for the malkins do_not respond to an_e mail seek comment
there be also question swirl around demand for a reit feature the empire_state building as one of its cornerstone
while some investor will_probably be draw to the romantic notion of own a piece of the fabled skyscraper some analyst note_that the building and several of the other property include in the reit be not view as modern first class office_building
in recent_year the malkins have embark_on a major renovation of the empire_state building that be draw a better more corporate class of tenant and yield high rent
but the once hot market for real_estate investment trust have cool considerably since this spring
a bloomberg index of office reits be down 10.5 percent since hit a four and a half year high in late may. reit do extremely well early in the year but share price have pull back since may say michael knott a manage_director with real_estate research firm green street advisors
he say however that new_york office reit have hold up better_than those in other part_of the country in the belief that manhattan real_estate have stabilize
while some of the bidder hope that the wobbly reit market have open the door for them to sweep in with a compete offer analyst_say the bid so_far appear to be fall_short
the offer do_not appear high enough to persuade the malkins to change direction mr. knott say

if_you have not watch key peele keegan michael key and jordan peele 's sharp and periodically hilarious show on comedy central you have get time before the premiere of season 3 on_wednesday night to catch_up
youtube and comedycentral.com offer collection of their great hit from das negros mr. key and mr. peele in whiteface placate a nazi play by ty burrell of modern family to the original sidesplitting substitute teacher
mr. key as an inner city disciplinarian take roll in a suburban classroom where be a a ron right_now
of course sketch comedy be a hit or miss proposition and watch a concentrated dose of mr. key and mr. peele 's best product could make the season 3 premiere look a little pale by comparison
it get off to a pointed but quiet start with a one joke trayvon martin video and most of what follow a new substitute teacher sketch a les miz spoof will leave fan fidgety
the high point be an over the top slightly surreal bit with mr. key as a rapper and mr. peele as his deranged hype man
thing look up in the second week though with a couple of sketch that display the pair 's talent for inspired silliness and their emphasis_on the oddity and danger of language
in one mr. key play a terror suspect who ' the victim of a terrible misunderstanding his wiretapped conversation be about terrier
we write terrierist fiction
we spend a good deal of time discuss possible future terrierist plot
mr. key and mr. peele 's comedy be often call postracial but it may be more accurate to call it postsatirical at_least compare_with the work of someone like dave chappelle whose 2003 6 comedy central show have influence the format and theme of key peele
their best_know and most directly political sketch the obama anger translator series be among their weak they be labor and not particularly insightful
what really set key peele apart be the star performance
mr. key especially be a gifted comic actor able_to sell a range of character and attitude from ritualized black male anger to you lookin at me
italian mobster bravado
the gangster role come next_week in a short slight sketch redeem by mr. key and mr. peele 's spot on portrayal of off duty goodfellas
as in das negros they insert themselves in conventional white role the flee jew the crooked italian and the white people around them do_not notice
the joke be equally about race and pop culture stereotype but when the bullet start fly it_' just purely grossly funny
decade_ago each fall dance season begin in central_park
from 1962 to 1980 except for gap cause_by finance in 1968 and 1973 an_annual festival draw crowd to the delacorte theater
first it be call the rebekah harkness foundation dance festival and then from 1969 on the new_york dance festival a name befit its place in the civic fabric
always it be free and eclectic its program mix establish and little know artist its audience mingle connoisseur and first timer
new_yorkers love it and after the financing collapse and it be go
it be speak of as much miss
that festival be still defunct but since 2004 its place have be take by city center 's fall for dance
though the new festival be not_quite free ticket originally $_10 be now $_15 it be eclectic both in the dance company that have participate 177 of them and in those_who have watch 220,000 ticket sell
fall for dance 's 10th installment do_not begin at city center until next wednesday but as a celebratory prelude and a claim to a legacy the festival bring dance back to the delacorte for free show host by the public theater on_monday and tuesday
new_york dance festival lore be fill_with story of dancer slip and slide in the rain adventure in outdoor theater
but the weather on_monday night be clear and chill with a nearly full harvest moon put on a show of its_own alone above the stage or frame by tattered cloud
the proscenium arch of the firmament and a backdrop of tree make the delacorte a site for dance like no other in the city
at first the tree be occlude by scaffolding a multilevel structure some 30 foot high hang with work light to resemble a makeup mirror
this be the set for human fountain by streb extreme action company
the 20 performer sleek in red unitard march on like astronaut before a launch and launch be what they do repeatedly climb the scaffolding and diving off it to crash flat onto a thick mat below
there_' a vicarious thrill in the drop and some variation in the form tilted dive backward dive corkscrew jackknife
there_' grace in a domino line of diver each open an arm to rotate into reverse fall
but the shape in the air be halfhearted and the choreography quickly grow dull
the piece keep land with a thud bear little relation to its mozart accompaniment
it be supposedly inspire_by the bellagio fountain in las_vegas but those waterworks be much_more musical
at this festival it feel_like an overextended pun
still human foundation be suit to the outdoors
ronald k. brown 's upside down a much better deep work lose some of its power in the open space
instead of scaffold the dance be back by roll stage fog light green or red and by musician two drummer a d.j. and the statuesque singer wunmi olaiya work up a fela kuti groove
the rich suppleness of mr. brown 's west african base movement register as do the profundity in the work 's confrontation of life force and mortality yet its group patterning seem stretch thin
the dance burn but also gutter like a flame in the wind
red angels by ulysses dove do_not belong anywhere
certainly not in the repertory of new_york city_ballet which send four of its dancer to represent the company in this inane double duet
that it_' set to a solo for electric violin play live by mary rowell be its practical justification
yet as an_attempt at trashy it be not even flashy and from the troupe with the world 's great stock of ballet it_' a terrible waste
what new dancegoer could fall for it
blessedly the evening finish with the paul taylor dance company in esplanade
as its title tell you this classic dance from 1975 be at home in the open air
on a program with the climbing and fall of human fountain it make similar point about simple verb
mr._taylor 's dancer walk run jump and crawl
but they do these basic activity to bach and the relationship between their action and the music be meaningful
the meaning keep change a hand extend in yearn then in rejection run be playful then distraught
the work be less dangerous than human fountain but more daring
in the end joy in motion triumph with the dancer dive across the stage
this be how to make audience fall for dance fall hard and fall for good
the fall for dance festival run from next wednesday through_oct. 5 at city center 131 west 55th street_manhattan 212 581 1212 nycitycenter.org
the saxophone be the most ambiguous of instrument
though ubiquitous in jazz and pop it have long remain on the fringe of classical music bring in for the occasional bolero but rarely afford the spotlight
when it find its way into the orchestra it often function as a jazzy outsider an ambassador of pop
few contemporary composer be better poise to trade on the saxophone 's ambivalent status than john adams who long_ago master the art of move nimbly between the classical and pop world
mr._adams have toy with the instrument ever_since he introduce a saxophone quartet into his opera nixon in china a quarter_century ago
and in recent_year mr._adams have rediscover the saxophone and its midcentury jazz legacy even as he have distance himself from young composer who draw on the commercial music of their_own era
when the soloist timothy mcallister and the baltimore symphony_orchestra give the united_states premiere of mr._adams 's saxophone_concerto on_friday at meyerhoff symphony hall in baltimore it will be an auspicious event for the large but often overlook world of classical saxophonist
those_who miss the baltimore performance can hear the concerto perform by mr. mcallister and the st._louis symphony_orchestra in a live online broadcast on_oct. 5 nonesuch will release a recording next_spring
this new work grow out of mr._adams 's lifelong love for the slippery sound of the sax and also take inspiration from the virtuoso technique of mr. mcallister who be a professor_at the bienen school of music at northwestern and at 40 one of the foremost saxophonist of his generation
in_2009 mr._adams hear mr. mcallister play city noir mr._adams 's jazz inflect symphonic work with a major saxophone part and decide he have to write more for him
in a recent phone_interview mr._adams eagerly extol mr. mcallister 's strength
you find that with great artist that the detail the actual technical detail of the instrument the reed the mouthpiece the pad and all of those little tiny minuscule physical detail be so important mr._adams say
on the one hand that impress me and the other be just his absolute indefatigable willingness_to just do_anything
mr. mcallister seize the opportunity
for me personally adams have be no
1
he ' be for me the no 1 goal of someone we_need to get a piece from he say recently
it_' still adams at the core deep polyrhythmic structure these huge giant kind_of glacial form
that ' really exciting to hear these trademark about his music and then reference the saxophone in these multiple setting
the saxophone have autobiographical implication for mr._adams who say that it have always be a part_of my musical genealogy
his_father play alto in swing band in the 1930 and mr._adams dabble with the sax in his youth
his main instrument be clarinet
though the saxophone have its_own classical repertory mr._adams seek out model from jazz
stan getz 's 1961 album focus and the compilation charlie parker with strings be particular inspiration
the sound of the saxophone with the orchestra particularly with the string orchestra be just magical mr._adams say
it always puzzle me that there be so few saxophone_concerto and certainly no really great saxophone_concerto in the way that there_' the mozart clarinet concerto there be in fact more_than a few saxophone_concerto just none that be regularly perform by symphony_orchestra
the best_know be by relatively obscure composer like glazunov and ibert
invent by adolphe sax in 1846 for military band the saxophone have a few early classical advocate like berlioz
but snobbery and intonation issue mostly keep the instrument out of the orchestra
instead saxophone find their way into american dance band in the 1910 and become core member of swing band as_well as the instrument of choice for jazz soloist 1_2 next_page
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_19 2013because of an_editing error_an article on_wednesday about the new saxophone_concerto by the composer john adams misstate the length of the work

maybe we never outgrow the imaginary animal kingdom of childhood
maybe it_' the one we be try_to save
these be jon mooallem 's intriguing word write in the introduction to his book wild ones
its subtitle be a sometimes dismaying weirdly reassuring story
about look_at people look_at animals in america but i_think of it on_sunday afternoon at la mama while watch sacred elephant a south_african production base_on the poem by the englishman heathcote williams americans have not corner the market on mr. mooallem 's sentiment
direct_by geoffrey hyland and perform by jeremy crutchley sacred elephant offer a torrent of word in praise of the creature 's nature and in despair over its fate
yet even as mr. williams 's word indict human for their treatment of these animal they draw comparison between the two specie
and from a share aquatic past the elephant inherit the one quality that homo sapiens have always arrogantly assume distinguishes him from the brute beast an elephant in distress
will weep salt tear
as mr. crutchley speak he move between man and beast and something more indeterminate his character be call the other and he be a compelling figure in his long coat and ankle shackle
his face be etch with sweaty rivulet of gray makeup his hair mat into a dreadlocked ponytail his eye redly rim
costume design be by illka louw
at time during the play a roughly hourlong monologue mr. crutchley rid a wild sharply edge energy that seem only partly moor to the word at hand
these word be by turn funny caustic and when least effective self consciously poetic
this would not seem the time for gild the lily with ode to the noble elephant it be difficult to be unmoved when consider the rapidity with which elephant be be exterminate
at the same_time if activism be the aim here it seem rather a misguided use of resource it be also difficult to imagine a typical la mama audience contain people_who be pleased at the idea of elephant extinction
and as a dramatic endeavor
sacred elephant could do with a bit more texture
mr. crutchley work overtime to supply it
but then again lamentation be not_necessarily vehicle for variety and there be not much here to reassure weirdly or otherwise

and the united_states will not do any of this by trust
this be not a matter of trust
it_' a matter of verify and verify and enforce
i_think everybody in the united_states need to understand please this would not have happen we would not have get this agreement if there have not be a legitimate threat of force that be pass by the foreign_relations committee and that the congress be consider
that be what bring russia and bring assad to this table
and it be important that that threat of force stay on the table in order to guarantee the compliance of the assad_regime
so we will_continue to press this issue we_'re determined to give diplomacy its full chance possible

also want_to say one other thing even while we have begin the process of address the weapon of mass_destruction the assad_regime wantonly brutally willfully continue to slaughter its_own people

elvis costello and the root begin their encore at brooklyn bowl late monday_night with a wry lamentation as churn and ominous as a gathering storm on the plain
the song be wise up ghost which provide both a title and a centerpiece for their trenchant new album on blue note
its delivery be impassioned unruly a bit grandiose -â grip but in a crucially different way from the rest of the show
because otherwise mr._costello the eminent post punk eclectic and the root hip_hop 's protean house band give an_extended lesson in collaborative thrift beef up some of his old song and cleanly tackle most of their new one
both party have make a recent sport out of play well with others and here they chase a lean intensity leave few scrap on the bone
the show be sell_out and its high celebrity quotient underscore the sense of a rare occasion which be more_than the song be prepared to do
wise up ghost the album be a taut sandpapery production full of caustic pronouncement deliver with medium cool affect
mr._costello sing evenly if obliquely about various form of ruination and betrayal against an assortment of vintage distressed funk and soul groove
at the foreground of every track be a drum part execute with slippery precision by ahmir thompson a k a questlove the brain behind the root and a musical savant whose obsessiveness rival mr._costello 's
perhaps take a cue from certain marvin gaye record the result of this synthesis can feel festive even in the grip of despair as on walk us uptown the album 's lead single
will you walk us uptown while our tear run in torrent to suffer in silence or pray for some solace wake me up which open the show at a prowl gait be just as point there must be something better_than this mr._costello grouse in the chorus reuse a line from his recent partnership with the new_orleans soul magistrate allen toussaint
my thought return to vengeance but i put up no resistance go another rueful line
there_' a_lot of strategic repurposing throughout wise up ghost and there be even more in the show
some of this be as straightforward as an old tune give a fresh makeover the root work with a strong horn section bring a sinister funk vibe to shabby doll and turn up the heat on spooky girlfriend which also feature a spirited vocal turn by la marisoul of the los_angeles band la santa cecilia
and in the accumulative deep swirl crescendo on i_want you there be a know echo of i_want you
she ' so heavy by john lennon
it_' not hard to picture questlove and mr._costello arrive together at that idea in any case another lennon tune
i find out serve_as a rawboned final encore plunge toward afro punk
other bit of repurposing be sneakier
tripwire a waltz that feature guest vocal harmony by diane birch bear more_than a casual resemblance to satellite
and on stick out your tongue mr._costello interpolate whole lyric swatch from not one but two tune from the vault hurry down doomsday
the bugs be take_over and pill and soap one line rip well out of context now suggest a hint of self appraisal in time you_can turn these obsession into career
mr._costello be in excellent plangent voice throughout the show which be archive online by wfuv.org
and he be in textbook form chewing gum stand at a slouch exude his indifferent charisma
even by the high standard of his collaborative history he be notably invigorate by his company
the root meanwhile now occupy a fascinating and maybe unprecedented position
since prove wickedly adept with a variety format -â questlove and company will_soon follow jimmy fallon from late_night to the tonight show the group have have a diminishing role for black thought tariq trotter its incisive workhorse of a rapper and frontman
he gamely do his part on late_night and he put in a token appearance on wake_up
g.o.o.d/columbia/homeschool the band 's 2010 album with john legend
that he ' nowhere to be find on wise up ghost a product of analogous style and political conscience feel_like a slight and maybe a further sign of shift ground
but if there_' anything the root have prove in recent_year it_' the danger of jump to conclusion about their intent
count that among the way mr._costello fit right in

the sound a d major chord produce_by an orchestra and a chorus begin abruptly full force and fill the air for 20_minute like a sonorous foghorn with a stuck switch
it end as suddenly as it begin but there be no applause because the orchestra be only half finish its member sit without play or even move perform silence for just as long
this highly eccentric symphony receive its first new_york performance on_wednesday be create by the artist yves klein who be best_know for his monochrome painting
he harbor no small ambition when he begin think in the late 1940 about a kind_of musical complement to his visual idea a symphony of monotony and silence a much hard thing to do well than he or anyone imagine
you_can not really do a full rehearsal of something like this say roland dahinden a swiss composer and performer who have conduct the piece four time in europe and will take the baton and stopwatch in new_york
it_' too hard
everyone would just die
klein be one of the lead heir of marcel duchamp 's modernist wit but he be not joke around
the monotone silence symphony he write express no less_than what i_wish my_life to be
but klein who die of a heart attack at the age of 34 in 1962 never have the chance to hear his symphony realize as he imagine it
for the only document performance during his lifetime in 1960 at an art_gallery in paris with klein himself in white tie as conductor only 10 musician participate
on_wednesday evening the fulsome orchestra he dream of 70 musician and singer will gather to perform the work at madison_avenue presbyterian church at east 73rd street
the hope among_those involve be that the sell_out performance the product of month of intense planning will hew close to klein 's ethereal intention than many other version attempt since his_death
with that goal in mind the performer and mr. dahinden have be prepare themselves mentally over the last_few week for an_unusual test of stamen patience and repose to play one note in an_intense and continuous way as klein instruct for an unreasonable amount_of time and then to remain quiet and motionless for longer than most people ever do
mr. dahinden who be be fly in for the one night event by the dominique levy gallery which be produce it add when it_' right you have this huge block of sound
there be such a beauty within the piece
you sit in the audience and you start to hear some melody and some fragment of melody and yet nobody be play them
klein say he saw the work as have neither a beginning nor an end a creation free from the phenomenology of time to pull_off the first_half of the symphony the singer and musician 10 cellist 10 violinist 3 bassist 3 flutist 3 oboist and 3 french horn player need to produce the chord with no vibrato or variation breathing and bow in such a way as to create a sound with no audible break
early on klein compare the sound to a human scream and play recording of scream one quite harrowing example be the voice of the french playwright antonin artaud to demonstrate
sahra motalebi a new_york singer and performance artist who have help to assemble the musician and the choir which will be make up of both professional singer and experimental musician say the reality be that it_' like a kind_of bizarre primordial universe chorus
it_' not like a note you have ever_hear
klein conceive of the idea for the symphony around 1947 48 the same year that john cage in new_york be formulate 4'33 a landmark work that involve a pianist not play the piano but instead attune an audience to the complexity of silence
though there seem to be no_evidence that cage and klein be aware of each_other at the time or influence each_other later klein also come to view silence as the most_important part_of the musical work
this be really my symphony he write and not the sound during its performance
daniel moquay who oversee the klein archive and estate in paris say the silence be sometimes more_difficult than the sound for audience to take in
you get into the deepness of a silence and you realize_that silence be not a nothing he say
silence be something that be very very powerful
the work anticipate some of the interest that fluxus artist would soon begin explore in new_york and europe in the 1960 and it feel very_much in tune with work by young contemporary artist like ragnar kjartansson who in_2011 stag a critically acclaim 12-hour performance of the denouement of mozart 's the marriage of figaro by opera singer
klein 's symphony have be perform both with the permission of the estate and without over the last four_decade once by a chorus of as many as a hundred singer and at_least once by a single musician with a laptop
during the original 1960 performance klein include a companion piece in which three naked woman he call them live brush cover themselves in his signature deep blue paint and press their body on paper during the sound half of the symphony freeze during the silence that part will not be recreate in new_york
dominique levy who be open her new gallery at 909 madison_avenue next_door to the church become determined to produce the symphony to accompany her inaugural exhibition audible presence lucio fontana yves klein cy twombly an examination of idea about time and music in work by those three artist
ticket for the free performance be all claim almost immediately after it be announce
ms. levy first hear the symphony in 2007 and say that after the abrupt cut between the sound and the silence i have all_these conflicting feeling of want_to laugh and then confusion and then finally deep emotion
early this_year she secure permission from the klein archive to produce the work and dispatch jennifer g. buonocore the gallery 's associate director to paris to delve into the archive to try_to ensure_that the work would be realize with the best understanding_of what klein want
but even with the best effort and intention mr. moquay say the symphony do_not always work
of four performance hold in a paris church during a klein exhibition at the pompidou center in 2007 he say he feel that only one be wholly successful
but it work so well he_add that a lovely kind_of st. francis moment occur
the door of the church be open and a pigeon come in and sit where everyone could see him he say
during the 20-minute silence he do_not move at all
it be kind_of incredible
and then when the silence be over he leave
as the director of the rockettes linda haberman know it be time to leave santa behind
as she put it christmas be kind_of a safe place to live
comfort zone have never interested ms._haberman
begin on march 27 she will unveil heart lights the rockettes first spring production at radio city music_hall since 1997
play for 59 performance it will have nothing to do with the music_hall 's previous easter spectacle
in the new show ms._haberman bring new_york city to life while continue to modernize the precision dance company with more athletic technically demand choreography
this be not a book musical and it_' not a revue she_say
it_' like its_own animal
and this animal at present have no traditional kick line
you_'re go to see a_lot of stuff you have never see the rockettes do before ms._haberman say
i_'m definitely expand their vocabulary
in this show i_feel like there be no limit
on_wednesday a section from electricity a number inspire_by times_square will be unveil on nbc 's america_'s got talent
the dance be a showcase for ms._haberman 's radical new version_of a kick line it feature a developpe in which the leg slowly unfold and be hold for a count and include only four kick
i_'ve be experiment with way to create the same feeling without do the literal kick line she_say
produce_by the madison square garden company heart lights feature a story by doug wright the pulitzer_prize and tony award winner for i be my_own wife
the tale follow two teenage girl through new_york as they unearth clue about their grandmother 's past
during the journey the rockettes perform dance that draw on the essence of new_york landmark like the metropolitan_museum of art a modern dance with an egyptian flair central_park a moody tap number set to the eurythmics
here come the rain again and the stock exchange a fast athletic dance that incorporate knee turn and hip_hop
for us it_' about make_sure that we maintain the precision part_of it ms._haberman say
as long as we have a specific point of view about what_we 're do i do_not think we_'re break our tradition
still this be a new era for the rockettes found in 1925 by russell markert as the missouri rockets
his remarkable parade of the wooden soldiers choreograph in 1933 remain a highlight of the christmas spectacular
in heart lights ms._haberman create her_own response to it
the simplicity of that have always just kill me because it_' so brilliant she_say
i_'m like what can i do
when visitor come to new_york they_'re like
oh_my god you walk so_much
i can_not believe how_much you walk
so it start out with one rockette walking and then another and then pattern happen and it build and build until it get crazy
it look_like two solid line be bisect each_other
unlike the radio city christmas spectacular which feature two cast and open on_nov. 8 heart lights have only one cast
recently the unthinkable happen an audition for the show be hold among the rockettes
the dancer traci reszetylo who have work on the production since its beginning do_not know if she ' in or out
i just try_to keep myself calm she_say
it mean so_much to me just to even have be a part_of it for this long
but as much as the rockettes be at the core of heart lights ms._haberman be also hop to create a deep emotional connection with the show
it_' great to see dance that move you and all of that but i_think that with the city and the rockettes there_' just a story that ' universal to all of us she_say
it_' about where you come from and where you_want to go
it_' about why people come to new_york to chase their dream
i be one of those people
the busy violinist johnny gandelsman be suppose_to have make his new_york recital debut on_aug. 13 at le poisson rouge
but fate intervene announce the concert 's cancellation on_twitter he compress into a hashtag the saying if_you want_to make god laugh tell_him your plan
in remark from the stage at the reschedule recital on_monday mr. gandelsman say without elaboration that it have not be bad_news that force him to cancel
the only apparent down side for him be that le poisson rouge its fall season already crowd could only fit him into a slot at 10:30 p.m.
that may not have be a down side at all
even over 90 intermissionless minute of dense solo violin music there be few yawn from the attentive and enthusiastic audience and just as in lincoln_center 's series a little night music the late hour add more coziness to what be already an_intimate program and space
a fixture on the new_york music scene mr. gandelsman play in the string quartet brooklyn rider and the chamber orchestra the knights and have long be a member of the stylistically omnivorous silk road ensemble
in 2008 he found a label
in a circle records
juxtaposition of old and new energize all_these group
brooklyn rider have perform and record seven steps a partly improvised group composition alongside the work that inspire it beethoven 's opus 131 string quartet
so it be no_surprise that mr. gandelsman 's recital range_from the baroque to philip glass
but the program be plan and perform to emphasize coherence rather_than diversity a treatment that be particularly revelatory when it come to the choice of mr. glass 's strung out 1967
while many have remark on indian music and rock 's influence on his early work mr. glass 's early music connection have be less note
but play between â heinrich ignaz franz von biber 's grand passacaglia and bach 's sonata no 3 strung out sound quintessentially baroque with the same tension_between stillness and motion the same working and reworkings of small piece of musical material
mr. gandelsman his ornamentation immaculate and nimble like spark in a dark church be as attentive to the music 's broad narrative as to tiny shift of texture and mood his tone translucently smooth at one point and with a dusky burr at another
wear jean a vest and short sleeve mr. gandelsman look folksy and his playing be accordingly unpretentious mod and clear with irresistible lightness a bright trill and a preternatural perhaps premature wistfulness
his vibrato be restrain in stravinsky 's somber ãlegie write in 1944 for viola and there be a core of melancholy calm even in the jovial moment of his rendition of bach 's partita no 2 which end almost exactly at midnight

it feature work from the orthodox all night vigil and divine liturgy include stark century old znamenny chant with selection sing in both church slavonic and english
the chorus demonstrate an appealingly blend sound austere and somber in the chant and joyous and more full blooded in the work by rachmaninoff
accord_to the program book contemporary composer who write sacred music and embrace the orthodox church be not interested_in construct a unique musical identity for themselves per se but rather in faithfully carry on and humbly add to a live tradition of sung prayer just as their predecessor do before them
one exception the estonian composer arvo pã¤rt have create sacred work in a distinctive contemporary style
the arrangement and composition by live or 20th_century russian and american orthodox composer include on the lineup here like benedict sheehan 's thrice holy 2012 have nothing in the way of harmonic twist or other contemporary marker to distinguish them from the traditional piece on the program
the polyphonic selection prove to be the highlight in particular an arrangement by sergius trubachov of gladsome light a type_of chant that originate in the valaam monastery in northwestern russia and blend feature of byzantine and znamenny genre

the policy aim_at end the longstanding practice of jail politician continue to collect public money be detail by preet bharara the united_states attorney for the southern district of new_york at the first public hearing of the moreland commission to investigate public corruption
the 25-member panel be establish in_july by gov._andrew m._cuomo to address what have be widely decry as a corruption crisis in albany and other political sphere in new_york state
mr. bharara say that as part_of the initiative prosecutor in his office file court paper on_monday in two separate corruption case give notice that they be add the pension of two state_senator a city_councilman and two other official to the list of property subject to forfeiture if the official be convict
any forfeiture action against a convict official 's pension would require judicial approval
mr. bharara call it a galling injustice that corrupt official can draw a publicly fund pension until their die day
he say that the statute under which official for decade have be_able to collect their pension despite corruption conviction be an error of state law and he note_that while it have be partially fix several year_ago it must succumb to common_sense
convict politician should not grow old comfortably cushion by a pension pay for by the very people they betray in office he say
more_than 30 new_york state politician have be indict or convict of a crime censure or otherwise accuse of misconduct in the last seven_year
the official whose pension could become subject to forfeiture as a result of the new filing be state_senator malcolm a. smith state_senator eric stevenson city_councilman daniel j. halloran and noramie jasmin and joseph desmaret the mayor and deputy_mayor of the rockland county town of spring valley

mr. smith 's lawyer gerald l. shargel say the action by prosecutor be premature
they can_not have forfeiture without a conviction and what i be focus_on be defend the allegation in the indictment and i be eager_to do that he say
vinoo p. varghese a lawyer for councilman halloran contend that it be inappropriate for mr. bharara to speak about his client before the public commission because he say the councilman have not commit a crime
lawyer for mr. stevenson and ms. jasmin decline to comment and mr. desmaret 's lawyer do_not respond to e_mail and voice mail message
mr. bharara say that under his office 's new policy prosecutor would also seek what he call appropriate fine with an eye toward the money that convict corrupt official may receive from publicly finance pension so the punishment fit the crime and so we can take the profit out of that crime
he also say that his office would consider civil forfeiture action against the pension of corrupt official who be previously convict and who fail to pay fine forfeiture or restitution impose at sentencing in order to satisfy those criminal judgment
and in future case as_well as pending one like those in which action be take on_monday prosecutor will use federal forfeiture law to strip politician convict of corruption charge
the panel convene at pace university also hear testimony from loretta e. lynch the united_states attorney in brooklyn and cyrus r. vance jr. the manhattan district_attorney
ms. lynch outline some of the current allegation face legislator include filing false travel voucher and more serious crime like obstruction of justice while mr._vance call for toughen state corruption law which he say be weak that those that prohibit thing like fix a fight
those that bribe public official in new_york be less_likely to be prosecute than those that bribe boxer mr._vance say
outside protester gather to rally for strong corruption law chant follow the money amid a heavy police and security presence

you may think that if_you run a business where 35 of your employee in a five_year period be indict convict or investigate and lead out in handcuff that this may inspire a period of reflection mr. fitzgerald say
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_20 2013an_article on_wednesday about a new_york prosecutor 's plan to curtail the pension of official convict of corruption misidentified in some_edition the county in which spring valley n.y. be locate

northwestern be 3_0 heading into saturday 's game_against maine with an offense average more_than 43 point a game and a roster that be get the right amount_of sleep
since pat fitzgerald become the coach in_2006 he have place an_unusual emphasis_on his player sleep behavior as a way to improve their performance
in the past he have change the time of practice and institute team nap but since the beginning of august in collaboration_with the university 's school of engineering fitzgerald have have his team undergo a sleep assessment
the idea be to assess the player sleep pattern and then suggest way they can have more and sound sleep
the player begin wear movement sensor armband during training_camp except when they be practice or in the weight room
the sensor have mainly be use to track the quantity and quality of sleep each player get
fitzgerald plan to have his player wear them throughout the rest of the season
although player be not require to wear the sensor most do
at first we do_not really know much about sleep and we be just curious say defensive_end tyler scott a team captain
but we really embrace it and after a while we get really competitive about sleep efficiency
we start check our data every_day
the study have_already have an effect
before northwestern 's season opener at california on_aug. 31 fitzgerald shift the team 's practice start time nap time and meal time to a west_coast schedule in an_attempt to minimize the effect of jet lag
the kickoff be schedule for 7:30_p.m. in california which be 9:30 in evanston ill.
so the wildcats begin practice at_9:30 p.m. make bed time for most player sometime from 1 to 2 a.m. fitzgerald do_not hold any football activity in the early morning allow the player to sleep until 10_a.m. emma adam a northwestern professor and an expert on sleep in adolescent and young_adult say she have see individual log and study their_own sleep pattern but she have never see an assessment do on this big a group of athlete
what they_'re do be take exist sleep research and translate it into a program design for their athlete that they hope will improve not only athletic performance but also a whole bunch of other thing adam say
sleep have effect on cognition your attention your memory your mood your metabolism your appetite it affect so_many different thing
this be not the first_time that fitzgerald and his coach staff have experiment with sleep schedule
midway_through last_season fitzgerald notice that his player appear sluggish during an afternoon game
after confer with a few player he learn that many have be take afternoon nap during the week because of their class schedule
fitzgerald then implement a mandatory nap time on game day
it be a source of joke at first but the player tell fitzgerald that the extra rest be beneficial
the result also be positive the team finish 10 3 only the third time northwestern have win at_least 10 game
in 2007 fitzgerald 's second year he experiment with move practice time from the afternoon to early in the morning
we be one of the first and certainly probably one of the most high_profile to make that full commitment to morning practice say tory lindley an associate athletic director and the director of athletic training service
since_then i have hear from a number of head athletic trainer around the country who have call us about our schedule and who have since move and change their schedule
the result lindley say be that the player be receive better nutrition before and after practice and that their performance be steady and more predictable
fitzgerald 's emphasis_on sleep may still draw raise eyebrow from some
but he have more victory than any_other football coach in northwestern 's history and the wildcats figure to be a force in the big ten this_season
that may be enough to prompt other team to consider the possibility of monitor their player sleep pattern
through all the thing that you have to do as a coach to try_to help your guy perform at a high_level and peak at the right time we_'re always try_to find way to improve what_we 're do and what_we 're teach he say and this be kind_of the new frontier

we can draw three lesson from the arrival of apple 's two new iphone model the 5c and 5s. lesson
1 apple may have set its_own bar for innovation too high
year after year steve jobs use to blow our mind with product we do_not know we_want
now two_year after his_death we still expect every new iphone to clean our gutter cook our popcorn and levitate
so when the hardware revision be minor each year we_'re disappointed
and sure enough after apple show off its two new iphone model last_week its stock drop
analyst shrug that they contain nothing transformative
the blogger hater have a field day
the budget model the new iphone 5c come in five color $_100 for the 16-gigabyte model with a two_year contract $ 550 without
it_' essentially identical to last_year 's iphone 5 except that its back and side be a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass
actually plastic be not_quite fair
the 5c 's case be polycarbonate lacquer like a glossy piano
better yet its back edge be curve for the first_time since the iphones of 2008
you_can tell by touch which way it_' face in your pocket
it_' a terrific phone
the price be right
it will sell like hot cake the new iphones go on sale friday
but just sheathe last_year 's phone in shiny plastic be not a stunning advance
lesson 2
the smartphone be mature
the app store fill a huge hole
siri voice command answer a desperate need
and high resolution retina display help compensate for the tiny screen
but today every phone have that stuff the big hole have be plug
maybe the age of annual mega leap be over
the new 5 $_200 with contract $ 650 without look exactly like last_year 's thin and gorgeous iphone 5
you_can now get it with its brushed aluminum body in dark gray with black glass accent silver white accent or a surprisingly classy look gold white accent
apple say the 5 's chip be twice as fast as before
nobody be exactly complain_about the iphone 's speed before but sure it_' plenty quick
since it_' a 64-bit chip apple say the graphic in 3-d video_game look especially smooth and detailed
there_' also a second chip devote to track motion data from the phone 's compass gyroscope and tilt sensor
apple say this coprocessor should save battery life when you use fitness track apps because it can monitor your data all day long the main chip which require six time as much power can remain asleep
those be both fairly invisible change though
the new camera will mean more to you
its sensor be 15_percent big and the individual light detect pixel be big
take photo side by side with the iphone 5s 's predecessor and the difference be immediately obvious lowlight picture be far better on the new phone
clearer bright better color
the 5 also have two led flash one pure white one amber that fire simultaneously
when mix in the right balance their light can match the color tone of your subject moonlight streetlight fluorescent whatever
apple say this idea be a first in both phone and camera
it really work
flash photo look much much better
no_longer will your loved one skin look either nuclear white or avatar blue
the 5s 's camera also offer a burst mode 10 frame a second 3x zooming during video capture instagram style photo filter and truly wow slow motion video
weirdly filter photo and slo mo video do_not survive the transfer to your computer although you_can send them by e_mail or text_message
sample photo and video accompany this column online
the most heavily promote feature be the 5s 's fingerprint sensor which ingeniously be build into the home button
you push the home button to wake the phone leave your finger there another half second and boom you have unlock a phone that nobody else can unlock without the hassle of inputting the password
and yes a password be a hassle half of smartphone user never bother set one up

during this_year 's world baseball classic cuba 's jose dariel abreu hit a grand_slam against china that be positively jaw dropping
abreu a powerfully build right handed hitter load up on his back leg wait on a curveball and hit a tower drive halfway up the outfield stand
thirty major_league front_office be surely pay_attention
last_month abreu defect from cuba the late player to leave the nation to pursue a major_league career
yasiel puig 's electric summer in los_angeles for the dodgers and yoenis cespedes 's success with the oakland athletics the past two season have help to fuel the hype surround abreu 's imminent arrival in the major
it be possible that when abreu do sign his deal will be the rich of any cuban defector top puig 's $_42 million
there be more and more interest in the cuban player all the time say the agent jaime torres who_represent puig
look how well they be do
still abreu be a player who have spend his career hide from most major_league scout and have essentially be compete against hard to evaluate opponent
he could be the next great cuban star or merely the beneficiary of a bull market for cuban player
there be little certainty either way
abreu 26 stand 6_foot 3 inch and weigh 250 pound
he be a first_baseman with ample power but also a sharp batting eye and the ability_to hit for a high average
the number he put up in cuba 's serie nacional be staggering
in the 2009 10 season abreu rise to stardom when he hit .399 with 30 home_run 76 run bat in and a .555 on base percentage
the next_year he have one of the best season in the history of the cuban league bat .453 with 33 home_run and 93 r.b.i. in only 66 game he miss 23 with bursitis in his shoulder
his past two season have be similarly prodigious
at the world baseball classic this_year he be 9 for 25 with 3 home_run in 6 game
abreu be often call a four tool player miss only the speed of his countryman puig and cespedes
scout have compare him to ryan howard because of his size and easy power
peter bjarkman who cover the cuban league for baseballdecuba.com say abreu have the look of a young mark mcgwire
add to his value abreu will be part_of a relatively thin free_agent class in the major_league
so_far the san_francisco giants have express interest as have the boston red_sox the pittsburgh pirates and the baltimore orioles
the mets still look for an impact hitter at first base would also make an intriguing landing spot
ike davis once think to be the mets first_baseman of the future spend time at class aaa las_vegas this_season and be recently shelve with an oblique injury
neither of his replacement lucas duda and josh satin inspire much confidence as a long_term solution
abreu could be a quick albeit expensive fix should general_manager sandy alderson decide he be up for a somewhat risky bid war
but abreu be hardly a guarantee at the major_league level
an international scout for one major_league team say that alfredo despaigne and frederich cepeda outfielder on the cuban national_team be more dangerous hitter
an international scout for another team say that major_league club could_not afford to make a mistake when spend big on a first_baseman since it be a traditional power position fill by player who bat in the middle of the lineup
in other_word the scout say the same money that could be use to sign abreu may be better spend in the acquisition of one of the many establish first basemen you already know can hit big league pitching
neither scout want_to be quote by name discuss a player his team may end_up bidding on
bjarkman note_that abreu 's prodigious number come in a league that be leak talent as more and more player leave the country
some pitcher in cuba he say throw between 80 and 85 mile_per hour which be almost akin to bat practice in the major
his number in the cuban league be great but they come against some very mediocre pitching bjarkman say
for the national_team he drop off a bit
if there be a question it_' whether he can adjust as quickly to the better pitching as the cuban player who have be so good in the major
sigfredo barros a baseball writer for the cuban newspaper granma say sometimes it can be very hard to tell with the cuban player
not everyone can be puig
right_now abreu be work to establish residency in haiti so he can legally work in the united_states
if he come directly he could work immediately but he would have be subject to the amateur draft and deprive of his lucrative free agency
in_addition major_league baseball 's new interpretation of regulation from the treasury department 's_office of foreign assets control mean abreu will face a long wait before he be clear
in the past cuban defector need only to prove permanent residency in a country outside cuba
now baseball require player to petition the foreign assets office a process that can take several_month
praver shapiro sports management which have handle other cubans like pitcher livan hernandez will represent abreu
last summer the agency negotiate a nine year $_30 million contract for another cuban client jorge soler who sign with the chicago cubs
abreu be expect to have a showcase for scout in the dominican republic this_month at which point the hype will_probably grow
where it lead remain to be see
washington the foreign intelligence surveillance_court on_tuesday offer its most extensive public explanation for why it have allow the government to keep record of all americans phone_call release a previously classify opinion in which it say the program be constitutional and do_not violate americans privacy right
while the once secret call log program have be periodically reapproved by the court since 2006 it have come under criticism from member of congress of both party and civil libertarian since its existence come to public light in_june after leak by the former national_security agency contractor edward_j. snowden
in a 29-page opinion that quote the n.s.a. director keith alexander as say the leak have cause significant and irreversible damage to national_security judge claire v. eagan a federal_judge in the northern district of oklahoma declare that the program be lawful
so she write any decision about_whether to keep it be a political question not a legal one
this court be mindful that this matter come before it at a time when unprecedented disclosure have be make about this and other highly sensitive program design to obtain foreign intelligence information and carry_out counterterrorism investigation she write add in the wake of these disclosure whether and to what extent the government seek to continue the program discuss in this memorandum opinion be a matter for the political branch to decide
the opinion by judge_eagan a 2001 appointee of president_george w._bush who be assign to the surveillance_court by chief_justice john g. roberts jr. this_year also note_that no telecommunication company have invoke its legal right to object to turn over its customer call record to the government
to date no holder of record who have receive an order to produce bulk telephony metadata have challenge the legality of such an order she write
the opinion date aug. 29 be the first write since the program come to light
while other judge have routinely reauthorized the program every 90 day with only brief reiteration of the court 's legal analysis accord_to an official familiar with the still classified ruling judge_eagan write the lengthy memorandum apparently for the purpose of public release
judge_eagan note in her opinion that the court have previously reauthorized the program to continue for another three_month on july 19 after have hold an extensive hearing to receive testimony and evidence on this matter
in a footnote she_say that only the government and not opponent of the program participate_in the hearing as be routine for such proceeding
james r. clapper the director of national intelligence laud the opinion as one that affirm that the bulk telephony metadata collection be both lawful and constitutional
in a statement he say its release be consistent_with president_obama 's call for more transparency on these valuable intelligence program
but jameel jaffer a senior attorney at the american civil liberties union call the opinion completely unpersuasive criticize it for fail to mention a landmark privacy case decide by the supreme_court last_year and portray its statutory analysis as equally weak
on the whole the opinion only confirm the folly of entrust privacy right to a court that hear argument only from the government he say
the legal analysis judge_eagan endorse echo the basic argument that the obama_administration have make in defend the program since it come to light include in an unsigned justice_department white paper it release last_month
among_those argument be that phone_call metadata phone number time and duration of call but not content be not protect by fourth amendment privacy right because it do_not involve eavesdropping on the content of call
she also agree that the government have legal authority to collect all calling record from phone company under a provision of the patriot act that allow it to obtain business record deem relevant to an investigation and that member of congress have have an opportunity to learn_how the patriot act be secretly be interpret before lawmaker reauthorized the law
the program trace its origin to one aspect_of the bush_administration 's expansion of surveillance outside statutory or judicial framework after the terrorist attack of sept._11 2001
it be later bring under the authority of the surveillance_court and link to the patriot act
the security_agency use the database to perform link analysis see who may have be in contact directly or indirectly with terrorism suspect in hope of identify hidden cell
under rule impose by the court the agency may search_for phone_call only if there be reasonable articulable suspicion that the underlie phone number be link to terrorism
in explain_why the court have reauthorized the program judge_eagan say that accord_to the government there be no compliance incident violation of the rule limit how the database may be access by analyst in the previous three_month period
last_week the government release document by another judge on the foreign intelligence surveillance_court relate to a 2009 reprimand of the security_agency for violate the rule and for mislead the court about how it be use the database
it have come to light that the agency be automatically compare each day 's fresh batch of phone data with an alert list of thousand_of number its analyst have flag only about 10_percent of which meet the standard of the court impose rule
the court be aware that in prior year there have be incident of noncompliance with respect to n.s.a. 's handling of produce information judge_eagan write
through oversight by this court over a period of month those issue be resolve
the census_bureau report yesterday that the poverty_rate in america hold stable between 2011 and 2012 at about 15_percent
accord_to the official measure poverty today be high than it be in 1973 when it reach a historical low of 11.1 percent
to many this dismaying fact suggest_that taxpayer waste billion of dollar a year fight a war on poverty that have be largely lose
as representative paul d. ryan republican of wisconsin say earlier_this year we have spend $_15 trillion from the federal_government fight poverty and look_at where we be the high poverty_rate in a generation 15_percent of americans in poverty
but this position be wrong for two reason
the first be that the official measure be misleading it measure only cash income and it do_not count benefit_from many program that help the poor
if_they be count the rate would be close to 11 percent
consider the supplemental nutrition assistance program commonly know as food_stamp which be first put into nationwide use in the 1960
the immediate benefit be easy to calculate a dollar of snap subsidy spend on food free up a dollar for low_income family to spend on rent utility or other need
when snap benefit be count as income they lift almost four_million people above the poverty line
and snap benefit not only reduce food insecurity and poverty this_year they also reduce poverty in the next generation
recent research that track child into adulthood find that family access_to food_stamp improve their infant health and birth weight
child who benefit_from the program later post better health high educational attainment less heart disease and for woman great earnings and less reliance on welfare as adult
the earn income tax credit be also ignore in calculate the poverty_rate
yet this program offer work low_income family with child about_$ 3,000 a year
when these tax refund be count they reduce the number of people in poverty by about 5.5 million_people
social_security benefit be count in the official measure but their large antipoverty effect receive little attention
without these benefit the elderly poverty_rate would have be more_than 44 percent instead of the actual rate of less_than 9_percent
the next time critic of the safety net claim that we fight a war on poverty and poverty win remind them that without these and other program poverty would be much high
but say the critic if all_these program have such broad effect why have the poverty_rate stay so frustratingly stable
that ' the second flaw in the conventional wisdom
all thing be equal such program whether we count them or not should have reduce the official poverty_rate across generation
but all thing have not be equal
although these program help the poor poverty remain high because inequality of economic outcome have increase sharply since the 1970
before income inequality take off the poverty_rate fall more rapidly with g.d.p. growth
but while the economy grow by 2.8 percent in 2012 and corporate profit go up as a share of national income the earnings of full_time worker median_household income and the poverty_rate barely change
antipoverty program do help but their recipient do_not move_forward because_they no_longer benefit much from that other great poverty ameliorating factor economic_growth
that ' not to say that growth be no_longer necessary for reduce poverty
but in our gilded age of inequality growth alone be insufficient
a few change would make a difference
first a poverty measure that incorporate all anti poverty policy would show that the safety net be more effective than critic say and would show how painful cut to those program could be
in fact the census_bureau have_already develop a supplemental measure that reveal the importance of these program to low_income family
but when it be release next_month it will receive far_less attention than the official rate from policy_maker and the press
second more benefit_from growth must reach the poor and the best way to do that be through match robust antipoverty measure with policy that lower the unemployment_rate and increase wage
during the full employment year of the late 1990 even low wage rise in step with productivity and poverty fall more sharply than it have in a generation
a minimum_wage increase help then and an increase now would help again
lower poverty mean both recognize the success of safety net program we now have and devise new policy that can spread the gain generate by economic_growth
if we do_n't then we will_continue to face poverty_rate that be unacceptably high and wonder_why we can_not do_anything about them
sheldon h. danziger be the president of the russell sage foundation and a co editor of legacies of the war on poverty
i be at a conference in bern switzerland last_week and struggle with my column
news of russia 's proposal for syria to surrender its poison_ga be just break and change every hour force me to rewrite my column every hour
to clear my head i go for a walk along the aare river on schifflaube street
along the way i find a small grocery shop and stop to buy some nectarine
as i go to pay i be look down fish for my swiss franc and when i look up at the cashier i be take aback he have pink hair
a huge shock of neon pink hair very euro punk from the 90
while he be ring me up a young_woman walk by and he blow her a kiss through the window not a care in the world
observe all this joie de vivre i_think to myself wow would not it be nice to be a swiss
maybe even to sport some pink hair
though i can_not say for sure i get the feeling that the man with pink hair be not agonize over the proper use of force against bashar_al assad
not his fault his be a tiny country
i_guess worry_about syria be the tax you pay for be an american or an american president and come from the world 's strong power that still believe blessedly in my view that it have to protect the global common
barack obama once have black hair
but his be gray now not pink
that ' also the tax you pay for think_about the middle_east too_much it lead to either gray hair or no hair but not pink hair
well bring on the grecian formula because our leader will need it
my big take away_from the whole syria imbroglio be that with europe ail china awol and the arab world convulse for an american president to continue to lead will require more help from vladimir putin because our president will get less help from everyone_else include the american people
everyone be focus_on obama_'s unimpressive leadership in this crisis but for my money the two main player who shape the outcome in way that would not have be predict but will have huge long_term implication be putin and the american people
obama get blindside by both
what do it tell_us
the fact_that americans overwhelmingly tell congress to vote against bomb syria for its use of poison_ga tell how_much the divide on this issue in america be not leave versus right but top versus bottom
intervene in syria be drive by elite and debate by elite
it be not a base issue
i_think many americans could_not understand_why it be o.k. for us to let 100,000 syrians die in a civil war/uprising but we have to stop everything and bomb the country because 1,400 people be kill with poison_ga
i and others make a case why indeed we_need to redraw that red_line but many americans seem to think that all we be do be draw a red_line in a pool of blood
who would even notice
many americans also understand that when it come to our record in the arab/muslim world since 9/11 we be 0 for 3
afghanistan seem head for failure whatever happen in iraq it be overpay for and libya saw a tyrant replace by tribal war
i also think a_lot of people look_at the rebel in syria and hear too few people_who sound_like nelson mandela that be people fight for the right to be equal citizen not just for the triumph of their sect or shariah
it_' why john_mccain 's soar interventionist rhetoric be greet with a no sale
i also think the public pick_up on obama_'s ambivalence his churchillian this must not stand rhetoric clash with his on second thought i be go to ask congress 's permission before i make a stand and i wo_not call lawmaker back from vacation to do so
the bombing be go to be big than a pinprick but also unbelievably small
it just do_not add up
finally there be an be you kid
question lurk beneath it all a sense that with middle_class income stagnate income gap widen and unemployment still pervasive for both white- and blue collar worker a_lot of americans be ask this be the emergency you be put before congress
syria
really
this be the red_line you_want to draw
i be out of work but this syria thing be what shall not stand
as for putin if he have not intervene with his proposal to get syria to surrender all its chemical_weapon obama would have have to either bomb syria without congressional approval or slink away
so why do putin save obama
in part no_doubt because he feel the only way he could save his client the syrian president be by also save the american president
but the big factor be that putin really want_to be see as a big relevant global leader
it both feed his ego and play well with his base
the question now be with the american people sideline and putin headline can we leverage putin 's intervention to join us in also forge a cease fire in syria and maybe even move on to jointly try_to end the iran nuclear crisis
i agree with obama on this no_matter how we get here we_'re in a potentially better place
so let_'s press it
let_'s really test how far putin will go with us
i be skeptical but it_' worth a try
otherwise obama_'s hair will not just be turn gray by the middle_east these next three_year he will go bald
representative aaron schock be a conservative republican from illinois but not conservative enough for the hard right_activist group club for growth which be seek someone to run against_him in next_year 's primary
his crime
in_2011 he vote to increase the debt_ceiling and in 2012 he vote for a stopgap spending_bill that prevent a government_shutdown
in neither case do he demand the defunding of health_care reform
club for growth and other extremist group consider a record like his an unforgivable failure and they be raise and spend million to make_sure that no republicans will take similar position in the next few_week when the fiscal_year end and the debt_limit expire
if_you 're wonder_why so_many house_republicans seem to believe they can force president_obama to accept a defunding of the health_care reform law by threaten a government_shutdown or a default it_' because these group have promise to inflict political pain on any republican official who do_not go along
heritage action and the senate conservatives fund have each release scorecard show which lawmaker have pledge to defund obamacare
when a senator like tom coburn of oklahoma refuse_to pledge right_wing activist be tell please contact senator coburn and tell_him it_' dishonest to say you oppose obamacare but then vote to fund it
tell_him he swear an oath to support and defend the constitution
mr. schock and 10 other lawmaker consider suspiciously squishy by the club for growth be designate as rino 's republicans in name only and the club have vow to find primary opponent and support them with cash a formidable threat consider that it spend $_18 million backing conservative candidate in the 2012 cycle
americans for prosperity a koch brother group that have_already spend million on ad fight health_reform be begin a new campaign to delay the law 's effect
these group all finance with secret and unlimited money fee on chaos and would like nothing better_than to claim credit for push washington into another crisis
win an ideological victory be far_more important to them than the severe economic effect of a shutdown or bad a default which could shatter the credit market
they also have another_reason for their attack fund_raising
all their web_site push the defunding scheme include a big donate button for the faithful to push
with your donation you will be send a strong message obamacare must be defunded now say the web_site of the national liberty federation another social welfare group that see dollar sign in shut_down the government
brian walsh a longtime republican operative recently note in u.s. news and world report that the right be now spend_more money attack republicans than the democrats be
money beget tv ad which beget even more money for these group personal coffer he write
point finger and attack republicans be apparently a very profitable fund raise business
it may be good for their bank_account but the combination of unlimited money and rigid ideology be prove toxic for the most basic functioning of government

it have be just over 100 day since the disturbing disclosure of the government 's vast and continue sweep of americans phone and internet record authorize by congress and approve_by a secret court issue secret opinion on critical element of constitutional law
since_then the debate_over the balance between national_security and individual privacy have evolve rapidly with each new disclosure from edward snowden
take the word of the director of national intelligence james clapper jr. who in march deny to the senate intelligence committee that the government be collect the very data
we now know it have be collect for year
after the surveillance be expose mr. clapper make the orwellian claim that his earlier denial be the least untruthful response he could give in light of the classified nature of the program
last_week mr. clapper tell a roomful of intelligence contractor that the conversation trigger by mr._snowden 's leak actually need to happen and may represent a good side to what intelligence official consider a calamitous security breach
conversation be meaningless of course without information and there too some progress be be make include a remarkable ruling last_week by the foreign intelligence surveillance_court
the court order the government to review for possible release the court 's opinion about the phone record program
the leak along_with court opinion and order the government have since declassify have engender considerable public interest and debate about the interpretation and application of specific provision of the patriot act judge f. dennis saylor iv write
further publication of court ruling would contribute to an informed debate the judge add particularly about_whether the law should be change or we would add the program themselves
judge saylor be not alone
on_tuesday afternoon the court declassify an august opinion by judge claire eagan authorize another sweep of telephone data
judge_eagan have request that the ruling be release because of public interest
the release of judicial opinion would not normally be notable in a constitutional democracy premise on open court but the foreign intelligence surveillance_court have be anything but normal
the government be justify in classify certain information regard national_security operation but in most case there be no good rationale for the classification of judicial interpretation of law
the government 's argument that the legal analysis be inextricably intertwine with secret may be true in some case but its blanket invocation have weaken its strength
last_week judge saylor write that further publication of the court 's order would also assure citizen of the integrity of this court 's proceeding
we will not know until we see behind the curtain

the coal industry and its allies be angry about president_obama 's energy policy and they have decide to take it out on his nominee to lead the federal energy regulatory commission which regulate the interstate transmission of electricity natural_ga and oil
the commission have no regulatory authority over coal
but that do_not matter to the industry
it have come_out against ronald binz the nominee because he support clean fuel when he be a state energy regulator
as the chairman of the colorado public utility commission he help colorado lawmaker tighten standard on coal fire_power plant cause some old plan to shut_down and be replace by natural_ga plant
those new rule be help to reduce_emission and improve the state 's air quality
one of the coal industry 's chief complaint against mr. binz be that he overstep his authority in his colorado post they refuse_to acknowledge_that a court_rule against that claim
mr. binz 's critic which include the far_right and some senate republicans want_to block his appointment because_they say he would encourage the construction of transmission line that will bring power generate by wind farm to urban area
they also argue_that he would undermine conventional fossil fuel by stand in the way of new oil and ga pipeline
his record however show he be no ideologue
the coal lobby and the american energy alliance which be partly finance by the koch brother be hop that their misleading campaign against mr. binz will convince some democrats like joe manchin of west virginia and mary landrieu of louisiana to oppose his nomination

the overuse of antibiotic in medicine and agriculture have long be know to foster the emergence of germ that be resistant to drug
on_monday the centers for disease control and prevention issue the first solid number on the extent of the problem
it say that at_least two million americans fall ill from antibiotic resistant infection each year of whom at_least 23,000 die from the infection a very conservative estimate
the agency warn of potentially catastrophic consequence unless prompt action be take
it say that up to half of the antibiotic prescribe for people be not need or appropriately use as when a broad spectrum antibiotic be use instead of a more target drug
overuse of antibiotic on farm where they be often use to promote growth and prevent disease in healthy animal also contribute to development of resistant strain of germ
the new report for the first_time put 17 drug_resistant bacteria and a dangerous fungus into three category base_on how big a threat they pose
three be deem urgent threat include a bacterium know as cre that be resistant to most drug and kill a high percentage of people_who become infected with it
though it be rare cause 600 death a year it have be identify in health facility in 44 state
further spread of the germ or transfer of its resistance gene to other germ could lead to a nightmare scenario the agency say

san_francisco officially there be no action in the america_'s cup on_tuesday
the combination of a strong ebb tide and wind in san_francisco bay force official to cancel both scheduled race
that mean the challenger emirates team new_zealand still have a 7 1 lead and still need just two victory to win the old major trophy in global sport from oracle_team usa.
but unofficially there be always action at this sink or swim stage of the cup which even after 162 year have the high_profile and high stake of any sailing event
win it and a team get everything that matter include the chance to stage the next cup where it choose and to a large degree how it choose
lose it and a team become just another prospective challenger at the mercy of the wind and whim of the defender
give the many million of dollar that the oracle owner larry ellison have lavish on this cup so_far for so little reward or public appreciation challenge or even abstain may_seem a better business plan at this stage
but there still do_not appear to be another winner take all formula quite as extreme as the america_'s cup in elite sport and although the interview on the dock be cordial and coherent tuesday the sailor and the big specialized team that support them all know that their job be likely_to end if the cup end in defeat
oracle_team employee continue to talk comeback cite australia ii 's rally from a 1 3 deficit against liberty in the 1983 cup which end the americans 132-year win streak
but the odds remain heavily in team new_zealand 's favor and on_tuesday in the america_'s cup park at pier 27 the end feel near with 50_percent discount on all america_'s cup apparel in the official store and with fan snap up hat and shirt before snap image of the two 72-foot catamaran as their crew prepare to dock out to no avail
with their huge wing sail surprisingly thin in profile mirror the vertical of coit tower and the transamerica pyramid in the distance it be an evocative scene
a peaceful scene too with the sunlight playing trick with the undulation in the water
but peaceful be far from the mood behind the scene
team new_zealand with significant government money but no guarantee of more need the victory to guarantee its survival
oracle_team usa with ellison surely hesitate about_whether to keep lavish many more million on something he have_already win be in the survival business too
he love to be a challenger and he love new_zealand say bruno trouble the former america_'s cup helmsman turn cup organizer
but maybe if he lose he will focus_on his island now on his new personal country
that would be the hawaiian island of lanai which ellison purchase nearly in its entirety last_year
but for this_week at_least ellison remain on what hawaiians call the mainland as his design team and sailor explore and re explore every possible tweak that may keep the momentum in their direction
ask for detail on their work be usually about as productive as ask an n.f.l. coach what he learn from watch game film
what be clear be that oracle have manage to narrow the gap in the last_week win two of the last three race and get a true point on the board after start the cup with a two race penalty impose by an international jury
the jury find that the team have break rule in preliminary regatta in small boat
oracle 's leader remain privately furious about that judgment which also deprive them of their lead wing sail trimmer dirk de ridder who be suspend
a post regatta legal challenge from oracle can_not be rule out if it lose particularly if the final score be close
meanwhile oracle have narrow the gap on the water in large_part by improve its upwind speed significantly
there be probably four or five change to the boat all visible to the naked eye so i will challenge you to find them say dirk kramers a design executive for oracle
team new_zealand apparently have not find them all yet
i_'m at_least three or four behind joke perhaps
nick holroyd the technical director for team new_zealand who sit_next to kramers at a news_conference tuesday
what come through in that exchange be the techie thrill they and so_many others have feel at be part_of the new and fast generation of cup yacht
i_'m like a kid in a candy store here kramers say
the rule govern the candy store shift significantly in may after andrew simpson a sailor with the challenger artemis racing die when the team 's ac72 capsize during training in san_francisco bay
this cup which have bring the venerable event into the extreme sport era be also suppose_to allow the team to compete in a wide_range of wind condition and avoid the cancellation that have hurt its appeal and marketability
the original wind_limit for the cup match be 33 knot
but after simpson 's death and extensive negotiation cup official lower the upper range to 23 knot and the ebb tide lower it further tuesday
as frustrating as it may_seem i_think the safety rule be in place for all the right reason say ken read a former cup helmsman who be now a television analyst
team new_zealand be once the team push for high wind_limit but with oracle appear to thrive in the upper range in the last_few day the new zealanders be now all for extra caution
oracle official make a request on_monday 's day off to raise the wind_limit by one knot
they also propose that race no_longer be stop once they have begin if the wind increase which happen on_saturday
i_think now the crew be so expert and the boat be hopefully very fit say tom ehman the vice commodore of the golden gate yacht club and a key member of oracle 's brain trust
so you_can do some thing that maybe three or four month_ago do_not seem reasonable
reasonable or not oracle 's proposal which require mutual consent be reject by team new_zealand which should come as no_surprise at this all or nothing phase of another america_'s cup when mutual consent be every bit as elusive as job security

deborah w. denno wonder_what that will mean for the law
over and over they put question to a guest speaker joshua r. sanes director of the center for brain science at_harvard about the implication for society if and when brain science can identify with confidence a propensity for violence or for lie
he bat it right back at them
you tell_me dr._sanes say
it_' a huge issue
i_wish i have something smart to say
last_year president_obama announce that the federal_government would create a brain initiative to speed_up the development of tool that can track how the brain work and how it break
it be not hard to imagine the benefit begin with more carefully target treatment for people afflict with psychiatric ailment
there have not be a brand new type_of drug for antidepression or autism or schizophrenia bipolar disorder or o.c.d. in something like 25_year dr._sanes say
this be where we have to make a long_term investment and come_up with some new type_of help because what_we be do be not work
work on animal have show in broad stroke how information get into the head and process but current imaging tool can_not keep up with the brain 's processing speed or be not powerful enough to follow the molecular transaction involve in pass information and create thought
dr._sanes have make close study of the retina which he call a beautiful part_of the brain
he rat the human eye as a 100-megapixel camera with 100_million light receptor cell
the eye also have layer of cell assign to detect color contrast edge and various motion especially of object rise up
from all_these cell the brain get 30 different representation of an image which it somehow assemble into a coherent whole
you 've never see reality the way it be he say
by the time it get to the brain it have be decompose
the brain just throw away 90_percent of the information because the brain 's job be to keep you alive
that mean edit out information that do_not pertain to predator or to prey
at some point we develop a cortex dr._sanes say
the cortex be kind_of in charge of make us think we have actually see something
many discovery have be make during treatment of certain epileptic patient who can only be help if a doctor sever misfire part_of the brain
because the brain have no pain receptor patient be awake and can describe what they be experience as their neuron be stimulate something a mouse can_not do
and it turn_out that there be a jennifer aniston neuron
the neuroscientist find a neuron that would fire when it saw a picture of jennifer aniston dr._sanes say
it would not fire for any of the other people from friend or a table or a car
what evolutionary edge a person get from such a neuron await more study
it be now believe_that diseased circuit cause diseased brain which we experience as psychiatric disorder dr._sanes say
a student brittany taylor ask what such broken structure would mean if_they cause somebody to commit a crime
be we go to look_at that as a mitigate circumstance or be we go to have to change our culpability standard completely
she ask
what if other part_of the brain be involve or if environmental factor be influence the neuron
could someone say with confidence that the neuron make him do it
science have a limit dr._sanes say
you_'re go to have all this information and you_'re not go to know
but he assure them that they need to be ready
knowledge from the human genome project of the genetic code will amplify or complicate brain mapping effort which be know as the human connectome
fifteen year from now somebody be go to say it_' the 489th neuron from the back of your ear that make you do it along_with a mutant gene dr._sanes say

detail bury in the united_nations report on the syrian chemical_weapon attack point directly at elite military formation loyal to president_bashar al_assad some of the strong finding to date that suggest the government gas its_own people
the inspector instruct to investigate the attack but not to assign blame nonetheless list the precise compass direction of flight for two rocket strike that appear to lead back toward the government 's elite redoubt in damascus mount qasioun which overlook and protect neighborhood and mr._assad 's presidential palace and where his republican guard and the army 's powerful fourth division be entrenched
it be the center of gravity of the regime say elias hanna a retired general in the lebanese army and a lecturer on strategy and geopolitics at the american university of beirut
it be the core of the regime
in present the data concern two rocket strike the significance of which be not comment upon by the united_nations itself the report provide a strong indication than the public statement of intelligence service of the united_states france or britain that the syrian military not only carry_out the attack but apparently do so brazenly fire from the same neighborhood or ridge from which it have be fire high explosive conventional munition for much of the war
loom over a tense capital and outlying neighborhood bristle with anger and fear mount qasioun be damascus 's most_prominent military position
it be also a complex inseparably link to the assad family 's rule a network of compound and position occupy by elite unit lead by member of the president 's inner circle and clan
the unit base_on the mountain be as close to the assad_regime as it_' go to get say emile hokayem an analyst at the international institute for strategic studies
mr. hokayem add that theory that the chemical have be launch by a rebel mole seek to discredit the government be unlikely because of the solidity and tight control of those unit
mr._assad 's government and its ally russia have continue to claim publicly that syrian_rebel be responsible_for the attack which kill hundred_of people many of them child in the most lethal chemical warfare attack in decade
but the united_nations data if accurate would undercut that claim and appear to erase some of the remain ambiguity
rebel force have never penetrate the major military installation of mount qasioun
in tactical and technical term they would almost_certainly have be unable_to organize and fire sustained and complex barrage of rocket from that location undetected
the united_nations evidence be gather through standard measurement and investigative technique at the place_where sarin fill rocket strike on_aug. 21
at one impact site investigator find both the place_where the rocket have pass through a vegetal screen above a wall just before it hit the ground and the small impact crater itself
they note_that the line link the crater and the piercing of the vegetal screen can be conclusively establish and have a bearing of 35 degree
at another impact area in another section of damascus a 330-millimeter rocket land on what investigator describe as earthy relatively soft ground where the shaft/engine of the projectile remain dug in undisturbed until investigate
the rocket 's shaft the investigator note point precisely in a bearing of 285 degree
there the investigator public_comment about their observation at impact site essentially stop except for a parting explanation that show how to reach a conclusion that the united_nations itself in accordance with its mandate do_not say
these azimuth or compass bearing they note can be reverse to show the direction from which the rocket have be fire
they point back toward the geographic source of the attack which investigator on the ground presumably would have be_able with their_own eye to see high above them in the city 1_2 next_page

washington for four_year president_obama count on fellow democrats to rally to his side in a series of epic battle with republicans over the direction of the country
but now deep in his fifth year in office mr._obama find_himself frustrated by member of his_own party weary of his leadership and increasingly willing_to defy him
in recent_week disgruntle democrats particularly liberal have bolt from the white_house on issue like national_security agency surveillance policy a planned military_strike on syria and the potential choice of lawrence_h. summers to lead the federal_reserve
in private they often sound exasperated describe mr._obama 's operation in public they be sometimes only a little more restrained
they complain the white_house have not consult enough and fail to assert leadership
they say mr._obama have be too passive and cede momentum to republicans
their grievance be sometimes contradictory some grouse that he take on cause he can_not win while others say he do_not fight hard enough for principled position
the failure to enact tighten gun_control law and the republican hold on immigration legislation have leave liberal little to celebrate this_year
if_you read the paper you almost think the republicans be in control say senator bernard sanders of vermont an_independent who caucus with democrats and vigorously oppose mr._summers until he withdraw_from consideration
they_'re constantly on the offensive
democrats be on the defensive
the lack of strong leadership he_add have create a vacuum
i_think you_'re go to see more independent say mr. president we look_forward to work with you but we_'re not simply go to accept your leadership and your ideas,'â he say
â we_'re not go to follow you
you_'re go to have to work with us.'â mr._obama 's trouble with democrats be not unusual for a second term and could be temporary or episodic
with re_election behind_him member of his party see no need to stick with him to secure another four_year
they be also look ahead to the next election earlier than usual with the emergence of hillary_rodham clinton as a front_runner
by the end of his fifth year president_bill clinton have alienate liberal with the north american free trade agreement a welfare overhaul and a balanced budget deal_with republicans
president_george w._bush in his fifth and sixth year be in bad shape with republicans who shelve his social_security overhaul rebel against the deteriorate iraq war and help sink his supreme_court nomination of harriet e. miers
it make it a_lot harder when it_' your_own party say peter h. wehner a top bush aide at the time
you_can not fire back with the same intensity and vehemence as when it_' the other party
and it just change the dynamic people expect you to be criticize by the other party
when your_own party do it it_' an indication of weakness
the internecine tension present a challenge to mr._obama as he head into renewed budget war with congress
it make a political life for him that ' already hard even harder say jared bernstein a former obama white_house economist
the gridlock he face from republicans especially in the house be extremely obstructionist to his agenda so when he run into democrats who be block him it become insurmountable
the white_house discount suggestion of trouble with congressional democrats and produce voting statistic show that with the exception of mr. bush mr._obama have more support from his_own party in his first four_year than any president through dwight d. eisenhower
democrats stand behind_him on health_care wall_street regulation and budget battle
president_obama have receive unprecedented support from his party in congress say dan pfeiffer his senior adviser
of course we wo_not agree on everything all the time every family have its squabble but the periodic disagreement in the democratic_party pale in comparison to the epic existential civil_war for the soul of the republican_party that be lead to so_much dysfunction
the white_house 's statistic show that senate_democrats vote with mr._obama more_than 90_percent of the time over his first four_year compare_with mr. clinton who have support in the 80_percent range over a similar period and president ronald reagan whose party vote with him in the 70_percent range 1_2 next_page

irene goodman kamaroff new_york sept._15 2013
to the editor we believe_that sell the fantasy of fertility by miriam zoll and pamela tsigdinos op_ed sept._12 paint an incomplete picture of the likely success of infertility treatment
despite the dramatic advance in medicine of the last 30 year it be true that not every infertility patient will get pregnant but patient and the public deserve to have all the fact
among_those fact be that assist reproductive technology treatment have result in the birth of more_than five million baby around the world and while it sometimes take more_than one attempt more_than 60_percent of woman who undergo treatment eventually end_up with a baby
we like the writer recognize the tremendous emotional distress that can result for patient whose treatment be not successful and hence the need to have transparency and full disclosure of available data for decision making in infertility therapy and cop with the emotional aspect that accompany it

lauren mufson clifton n.j. sept._12 2013 to the editor another consequence of the magical thinking market by the fertility industry be the unrealistic expectation that any woman no_matter how old can have a baby
as a nearly 41-year old first_time bride i be shocked at how_many people take it for grant that i could and would have a child
my effort to educate them on basic human biology fall on deaf ear
be not it enough i_think that i have_already beat one set of odds by marry in middle age
the fantasy that all woman can and should have child be perniciously pervasive as_well as highly profitable for the field of reproductive medicine
the cold hard truth be that the majority of woman over 40 wo_not conceive
i_guess a_lot of people just do_not want_to believe_that
julie lloyd washington sept._12 2013 to the editor be the 59,446 baby bear in the united_states from assist reproductive technology during the last reporting year a fantasy
be the fertility business as the op_ed writer bitterly call it offer just hype or be it really hope
would they deny cancer sufferer the hope of continue treatment once the initial treatment do_not offer a complete cure
the american society for reproductive medicine have do an excellent job in minimize hype by impose strict advertising guideline in report success rate
success rate for each practice be publish online at sart.org for all to see
the success rate in a woman 's age group for the specialist she plan to use be far_more important than some global failure rate
but the quest for a child can be so overwhelming that many do_not want that dose of reality
in my experience usually it be the couple that continue the fight long after the fertility specialist have recommend move on to another method of family building

tester be one of three democrats who spurn the president on his favorite to run the federal_reserve larry summers
the white_house do_not call tester until friday when it be too late summers be allow to twist in the wind like susan rice before him
top democrats who use to consider obama one cool cat now muse that he ' one weird cat as one big shot put it
obama still have a secret weapon congressional republicans who may yet shut_down the government or cause a cataclysmic default and make the president look good
but for now puzzlement grow over the contrast_between obama_'s campaign leap and his govern lassitude
obama biographer richard wolffe note_that the 2012 campaign have some of the same problem with leadership and direction but look good compare_with the mid-20th century romney crowd who could_not get an app to work
i do_not know who they think they_'re talk to or what they think they_'re try_to say say wolffe whose new book be the message the reselling of president_obama
the president be a very muddled and entrenched figure who need to get out of a defensive crouch and get some fresh idea
unlike bill_clinton who excel at boil down complex argument to simple one obama prefer to wallow in the weed remind people that he ' the smart man in the room and expect their support because he feel he be only do what ' complicated and right
but funnily enough as wolffe point_out he ' more like the clintons than i ever think this white_house would be with different faction and power base and personal rivalry
abc news 's george stephanopoulos ask the president about criticism of the administration_'s serpentine syria policy cite a frustrated backer of the plan to strike syria senator bob corker a republican of tennessee
corker say that the career around leave obama diminished as president and he observe that the president seem cage in the role like he want_to slip the noose
i_think that folk here in washington like to grade on style obama say dismissively of his syria critic
but why be it so often the president 's style to be unable_to sell the substance even on issue where most people agree with him
miami as many state prepare to introduce a linchpin of the 2010 health_care law the insurance exchange design to make health_care more affordable a handful_of others be take the opposite tack they be complicate enrollment effort and limit information_about the new program
chief among_them be florida where gov. rick scott and the republican dominate legislature have make it more_difficult for floridian to obtain the cheap insurance rate under the exchange and to get help from specially train outreach counselor
missouri and ohio two other state trouble by the affordable_care act have also move to undercut the law and its insurance exchange set to open on_oct. 1
in georgia the state insurance commissioner ralph t. hudgens have say he will do everything in our power to be an obstructionist
alarm by the resistance the secretary of health and human service kathleen sebelius and the obama_administration be intensify their effort to win public support for the exchange in florida and elsewhere and be confront their critic head on
on_tuesday ms._sebelius cap a three city visit to florida home to the country_'s second large uninsured population with sharp word about the state 's unwillingness to embrace the law
she will do the same in missouri later this_week
it_' unfortunate that keep information from people seem to be something of a pattern here in the state ms._sebelius say at a news_conference in miami refer_to restriction on outreach counselor
the online exchange be design to offer a variety of insurance plan at subsidized price and be mean to make health_care more affordable to low_income people_who do_not have insurance
outreach counselor know as navigator provide information_about the plan and help enroll applicant
ms._sebelius also criticize florida 's rejection of $_50 billion in federal money over 10_year to expand medicaid its concern_about privacy issue which she_say be unfounded and its sudden unwillingness to grapple with insurance rate
even among state hostile to the law florida become an outlier this_year when it pass a bill remove for two_year the state insurance commissioner 's ability_to approve insurance rate for new health plan she_say
this leave floridians vulnerable to high rate at a time when the new health plan will be introduce
in other state insurance commissioner use the law to obtain better deal for consumer to have the florida legislature pass a bill that for two_year 2014 and 2015 remove rate review authority really put florida consumer at great risk ms._sebelius say add no_one else have do that
ms._sebelius 's criticism be unlikely to inspire cooperation in florida or in the other state that vigorously oppose the law
mr. scott have be one of the law 's fierce opponent despite his decision to accept the $_50 billion for medicaid expansion
but the florida house block that effort this_year while mr. scott sit mostly on the sideline fail to lobby for the expansion lawmaker say
the state also choose not to run its_own health_care exchange leave it to the federal_government
democrats say mr. scott and republican lawmaker continue to throw up roadblock
last_week florida 's deputy health secretary order county health facility to bar navigator or outreach counselor
the health department say it be follow establish policy all outside group be prohibit from use county health property to conduct nonstate business
brochure though will be make available accord_to a statement
no write request for space have be make by navigator a spokesman say
county health office be important in the campaign to reach potential applicant because_they deal mostly with low_income people_who may not be insure
and on_monday in a letter to the top republican and democrat in congress mr. scott raise_concern about privacy say that navigator and others involve in the health_care effort could use applicant information improperly
attorneys general from 13 state have express similar worry_about the release of financial and medical information be it intentional or accidental
say that florida be ground zero in the obama_administration 's campaign to enroll people mr. scott ask house_speaker john_a. boehner and the senate majority_leader harry reid to thoroughly review what privacy rule and safeguard be in place
floridian should not have to exchange their privacy for insurance mr. scott write
ms._sebelius say on_tuesday that she appreciate the governor 's concern but that her office which oversee medicare be use to deal_with privacy issue
i can guarantee you we take that very very seriously which be why nobody will be collect personal health information at all at any point along the way she_say
verifying yes store it no
florida be not the only state complicate the obama_administration 's effort to roll_out the new exchange
a missouri law adopt this_year require the licensing of navigator and also restrict their activity
without that license the missouri law say navigator can_not provide advice concern the benefit term and feature of a particular health plan or advise consumer about which health plan to choose
ohio have adopt a similar law state that navigator can distribute some information but can_not recommend a plan or offer advice about benefit in a particular plan
in georgia the insurance commissioner mr. hudgens say his job be to protect consumer
to that end georgia mandatesâ that health_insurance counselor be license to become navigator a process that require criminal background_check and fingerprinting of applicant
for democrats the new state law and rule be just another way to throw up obstacle to try_to defeat the affordable_care act

ms. fowler be not a register lobbyist but she do provide in house advice on the bill work that have draw criticism from publication like the british newspaper the guardian and the web_site salon and the huffington post where the journalist bill moyers single out ms. fowler assert that when push come to shove corporate interest will have the upper hand
yet the progression from government to the private_sector be also predictable a window into the peculiar rhythm of life in the capital
young aide often fresh out of college or graduate school acquire highly specialized knowledge but eventually settle down build life and long for job that pay more and let_them see their child at night

phoenix the inspector who set out last_year to review the use of force policy employ by the roughly 40,000 federal agent guard the nation_'s border face a significant obstacle from the get go
neither of two separate system to track complaint of misconduct offer a clear way to link a specific accusation to the use of excessive force
the system one operate by the office of the inspector general and the other run jointly by customs and border_protection and immigration and customs enforcement all of them arm of the department of homeland security use different designation to categorize the complaint make it impossible for the inspector to determine the total number of excessive force accusation and investigation against agent accord_to a redact version_of their report release tuesday
although the discrepancy in the system have be know at_least since the inspector finish their work in_april customs and border_protection and immigration and customs enforcement have yet to add use of force as an option to categorize complaint the report say
to civil_right group the shortcoming underline one of the problem of have a fragmented mechanism to track misconduct that be partly under the authority of the agent employer
at the heart of this report be a question_about independence say chris rickerd policy counsel at the american civil liberties union one of the group that have press for the review
since january 2010 agent have kill at_least 15 people include a 16-year old along the border with mexico sometimes during confrontation set_off by rock throwing and other assault other time under less clear circumstance
the report do_not answer whether the agent be wrong in fire their weapon frustrate the 16 member of congress who demand the review after a pbs documentary last_year raise_question about the action of customs and border_protection agent in san_diego in_2010 when a man in their custody die after be stun several_time by a taser
use the abbreviation by which the agency be know representative lucille roybal allard democrat of california say i once_again call on c.b.p. to examine the best practice of the nation_'s top police force and take meaningful action to avert future case of abuse and death at the hand of the federal border enforcement personnel
the report 's scope be limit to the effect the surge in the number of agent in the past six_year have have on training and performance and whether reform adopt by the agency could help avoid deadly encounter
the change include audit of whether use of force policy learn in the academy be understand and correctly apply in the field
over all the inspector review 21,000 record from 2007 to 2012 which yield more_than 2,000 allegation of abuse excessive force or intentional discharge of a weapon
about 500 complaint could_not be categorize because the record lack enough information
the finding be mixed
between 2006 and 2009 when the border_patrol grow by almost 65_percent financing for use of force training quadruple
despite this and other budgetary increase customs and border_protection have yet to build a mock border fence in one of its training center to simulate the kind_of situation the agent be likely_to face the report find
several official interview by the inspector say that although border agent know the necessary tool and tactic of the job when they leave basic training they be not fully prepare_for some real life situation like the stress and fear they may face when rock rain on them from the mexican side of the fence
during an internal review customs and border_protection 's use of force division find that new border agent and custom officer be not train on all of the less lethal weapon available to them like pepper spray and tasers or sufficiently train on high risk situation like rock assault
in one instance an internal audit find that new agent simply do_not understand the use of force policy when they enter the field
custom and border_protection official_say it be a single episode out of 32 audit perform
in their response enclose in the report the official acknowledge the importance of have a mock border fence area
they note_that while the agency have the building material it do_not yet have money for construction though they be work to incorporate at_least one simulator in the current fiscal_year which end sept._30
we_should continue to expand the use of scenario base training and continue to pursue new technology to ensure field agent have the right skill the response read

elberton ga. for more_than 30 year the hulk granite slab inscribe with teaching in eight language have raise profound and vexing issue why be they here
what do they mean
what do they say about life after doomsday
but confront with a deep and sustained economic slowdown resident here in the profess granite capital of the world be now ponder something a bit more mundane be there a way to turn a mysterious 237,746-pound monument know as the georgia guidestones into a moneymaker
only one man be say to know the identity of the benefactor who go by the name of r. c. christian when he visit this east georgia city in 1979 and pay for the display supposedly on behalf of a group of others live outside georgia
i make an oath to that man and i can_not break that say wyatt martin 82 the retire banker who help broker the arrangement for the monument which be 19 foot_tall and resemble stonehenge
no_one will ever know
but nearly everyone here have a theory about the artifact build during the cold_war and say to be at_least in part a guide for civilization 's future in the aftermath of a nuclear attack
its edict include a call to unite humanity with a live new language and a recommendation to keep the planet 's population below 500 million
the census_bureau estimate the world 's population be 7.1 billion
to some it_' the holy spot on_earth say hudson cone who have track the history of the guidestones since he work for the elberton granite association a trade group that some believe order the construction to draw attention to the city 's mainstay industry
to others it_' a monument to the devil
take your pick
but if one man here get his way that last debate could become a spigot of cash for a county of nearly 20,000 people where unemployment approach 12 percent and the median_household income stand below $ 33,000
my long_term goal be to build some_sort of festival around it something that would be a weeklong thing that could be hold in two or three different spot around elberton that could really draw in crowd and help the local economy say mart clamp a local businessman who help his_father engrave the guidestones
there_' a big push right_now for the wholesomeness of how small_town operate
people be draw to that
mr. clamp who have long volunteer to maintain the oft deface structure urge county official this_month to lease him the land where the guidestones stand so he can mount a campaign to attract more visitor to this area near the south_carolina border
there be daunting legal obstacle to mr. clamp 's proposal
for starter the property 's deed bar anyone from charge admission to the guidestones and ban permanent building on the small county own site
but there be also early interest partly_because the guidestones have long attract visitor despite the absence of an aggressive campaign to tempt tourist and elberton 's significant distance from any interstate
it be the most visit thing that we have in elbert county say tommy lyon the chairman of the county commission
we get people come so i assume that with the right kind_of marketing it could grow
but even_if the guidestones have prove tantalizing to outsider include many from abroad there be still close to home skeptic like sandy beggs an elberton native who have never be to the site
i just have no desire ms. beggs say during her shift at her family 's christian bookstore
i_'ve just always hear bad_thing
others in the city cite anecdote about episode of witchcraft as their reason for keep their distance from guidestones road
there be widespread curiosity about the donor reportedly a tall dapper man with a midwestern accent who say he devise his pseudonym from his christian faith
and there be also a consensus that the secrecy surround the monument have add to its allure
whoever come_up with this whatever the reason whether it be r. c. christian or whoever they do a heck of a job say mike reser a south_carolina filmmaker who direct a recent documentary_about the site
if_they come_out and say r. c. christian be definitely so and so i do_not think anyone would visit the monument
even_if it come_out to be someone kind_of sensational it would cause a stir at that time and then it would die out and i do_not think the stone would be visit often
but even_if mr. christian 's identity become public mr. clamp say he want the stone to remain in place untouched a local monument even_if one that have not change the world
it have not really do_anything he say
the earth still turn and jimmy hoffa be not bury here

andy_pettitte the 41-year old start pitcher do his job but the offense get nowhere against blue_jays starter r. a. dickey or the toronto bullpen
the yankees manage only five_hit for the second straight game and it seem as if most of their at bat against dickey be over in second
alfonso soriano say the yankees be flat and low on energy because of have monday off and they find it hard to overcome their inertia
sometimes you get more tired when you have a day off especially on the road he say

it_' frustrating because i_feel like we_'re a good club pettitte say
i_feel like we have get a real good club
i do_not think that this should be as difficult as it_' be especially with some of the guy we have get back in the lineup
alex_rodriguez who leave sunday 's game with a strained right calf be back in the lineup as designate hitter
he go 0 for 4 and run very slowly to first base
pettitte pitch six and two third_inning allow one run and six hit a home_run to colby rasmus in the fourth
he be grow exhausted heading into the seventh especially with the quick half inning that dickey be work but girardi send_him out again
after josh thole make an out girardi come to the mound and check in with pettitte again
he say he be fine to face jose reyes and he do force reyes to hit a fly ball for an out with his 110th pitch
girardi go_back to the mound and summon shawn kelley who give_up a home_run to rajai davis on his second pitch
the way the yankees offense be sputter there be little hope for a comeback
before the game girardi_say he always try_to maintain a positive outlook
no_matter how frustrated he be after sunday 's loss he still wake_up the next morning with a smile on his face he say because the team still have an opportunity
but if the loss continue it will not be long before girardi 's opportunity to wake_up with a smile be eliminate along_with the yankees
every game be very crucial rodriguez say
it_' not like we_'re go to get mulligan for these so we have get to make them count

to appeal to the person_who want_to romanticize farming and the person_who be knee deep in turkey droppings be hard and i_think they_'re balance that she_say
it help that modern_farmer explore a subject on the mind of some of the world 's wealthy people
ann marie gardner the founder and editor in chief conceive the idea for a magazine in_2011 after she notice that source she interview for monocle magazine seem preoccupied by agricultural issue

scott mortimer publisher and general_manager at meredith corporation which include successful farming note_that grain price be rise land price be at historical high and the technology to produce crop have improve
ms._gardner may find that some of her big critic be not battle harden medium type but farmer
allan van tassel an 83-year old lifelong farmer who be ms._gardner 's neighbor tell her regularly that the magazine do_not have a chance of survival
it_' a nice idea mr._van tassel say
but as i say you drive up and down the road and you see these small conglomerate where they_'re go to raise thing one year two_year
then they_'re go
ms._gardner do_not discredit the peril of either publish or farming
while modern_farmer slowly and steadily progress last_year a windstorm wipe_out her entire crop of pear
this_year as she have log long hour make modern_farmer grow her_own garden have become overgrown
eventually she place her trust in a professional
i bring in a farmer to help me ms._gardner say

suzy menkes talk recently with jonathan saunders one of the rise young designer in london and winner of the emerging talent award for man 's wear in the 2012 british fashion awards
q. jonathan saunders you have win an award as a breakthrough man 's wear designer mean that after just two_year of do man 's wear you be top of the pile
how do you feel
a.
well i_feel privileged
i_think that the wonderful thing about man 's wear be that i_love do it
you_know it_' a joy
woman 's wear be something that be my passion and i have do it since i graduate college
but something that remind me of when i be a furniture designer remind me of man 's wear
it be very product lead
it_' very_much about the clothing as individual piece and you work in a different way when you_'re work on man 's
it allow me to do something that i really miss and that '_why i_love it so_much
q.
so as a young scottish boy what be the trajectory that bring you to this award to design for both man and woman
a.
well you_know i be not a kid that be bring up draw dress and aspire to be a fashion_designer
i go to glasgow school of art
i study furniture design
i_love work with marquetry and paneling of wood and color and all those different thing just make thing
and that ' how i start
and it start off as woman 's wear but because of that i_think it_' quite a natural progression into man 's you_know
it_' a pragmatic approach to design as oppose to the fantastical way we fantasize about woman 's wear
and although it_' similar and it_' passionate and it_' a joy to work on it_' very_much a more simplistic way of work
i_think that it_' for me personally a relief if that make_sense
q. i_think of your work as very linear very graphic and a_lot of pattern when you be work with alexander mcqueen
so where do that come from
do you as a child see a_lot of pattern and print
be that the start of it
a.
yeah i be always interested_in fine art
i always want_to be an artist
and i be not say that what i do now be anywhere remotely near that
but i_love the bauhaus i_love the idea of that movement where people get together and they think_about thing in a new way and they try new technique and they be very process lead
and that be what i be always inspire_by
i do_not think of myself as an artist
i_want to make thing but i do_not really know in which medium to do it
so i kind_of try and test different way of do it
when i go to saint martins i meet louise wilson
so my folio be a bunch of album cover copy and paste and stick together with sellotape of david bowie and color of pink floyd and a montage of all different idea
but it be not anything real
and she just let_me do what i_want to do and she believe in me and say o.k. so if_you want_to be a fashion_designer do it in your_own way and try it out
that for me be the starting point
i_think because of that it_' quite easy to translate_into woman 's wear or man 's wear or interior or whatever it be as a creative project i just love make stuff basically
q. you have some fantastic support not least from samantha cameron the wife of the british prime_minister and she not only wear your dress but she give a tipoff to michelle obama
a.
that ' kind_of wonderful be not it
i_think from a scotsman from a council estate in glasgow it_' pretty_good go
i_think what ' wonderful about samantha be that she love britain and she love the creative industry in britain and she ' happy to promote it and i_think that that be what_we 're all about these_day
whether it_' london men 's or london_fashion week all of us be try_to make ourselves not only innovator in term of idea but business
and something to come and see from a business perspective
i_think what samantha do and what michelle have do be really help support all of us which be brilliant
q.
but tell_us how it happen
so do samantha cameron just take a dress over and put it in front of michelle obama and say you 've_get to look_at this guy
he ' brilliant
a.
well michelle i_think buy her_own clothes
she go to a shop in chicago call ikram and she buy thing that she love
and that ' what i_love about any kind_of person that be wear your clothes
you_know if somebody have pick it out themselves and somebody appreciate it whether it_' everybody 's taste it do_not matter
and that ' what i_saw happen with michelle and i_think that ' what_happen with samantha
and i_think that you_know print and color be something that be what i_love and if it suit somebody for a tuesday evening then that ' perfect
q. kate middleton be somebody else that have wear your clothes
do you feel an affinity with these people
do you actually relate to them or do you just see them wear your clothes
a. i appreciate anybody make the choice to wear something that i have design
i always feel_like when i start that i be kind_of learn as i go
in london what ' wonderful about it be that you start from college you do it from your bedroom and all of a sudden you_'re on the internet and people know_what you_'re do
and to be quite frank you do_not really know_what you_'re do and you kind_of wing it for a couple of year and you try_to pretend that you_know what you_'re do and you learn it as you go
i_think that what ' wonderful about london be that it support designer like that to be_able to do that
in no other city in the world could you do it from nothing
you_know you get â£500 from the bank you do a collection and you get support from fashion east or the british fashion council or whatever it be
and we all manage to do our own collection and start that way
i_think we learn_how to be designer in a very_different way from the rest of the world
i_think that be something to be celebrate about
i_think that those people that wear it be advocator for that
q.
when it come to design man 's wear be it a very_different process for you
it seem to me now that man 's wear be very hot that a_lot of people be much_more interested than they be
it_' become almost as universal for man to look for new fashion as it be for woman to do so
a. man 's wear be a very exciting business to be involve in
i_think that guy want_to look different
they do_not want_to look generic which be a changed thing
because previously i know grow_up in glasgow if_you look anything from the norm you be in trouble
i_think that guy be pragmatic and they_'re practical and they look_at the detail on a cuff and they look_at the detail in the inside of something they feel how comfortable it be
they do_not want_to go_through torture wear something for the evening and they_'re very conscious of it
i be as a person let alone designer
you_know when a guy really do_not put up with much that teach you about be a good designer it teach you about how to work with fabric and how to make something work for a person and you_know it_' be inspire for me to learn about it

mr. vera and his allies push for an_unusual form of management which as much as possible allow nature to take its course
a bold and persuasive thinker mr. vera argue_that the grassy area should be crop not by domestic sheep and cattle but by beast resemble their wild ancestor
as these specie be extinct he settle on konik horse polish descendant of the tarpan and heck cattle which have be breed in germany in an_attempt to recreate the aurochs

let it be know that the tough drake era begin not this_week with the release of nothing be the same the first official tough drake album but rather begin all the way back on jan. 6 2012
that day saw the release of the video for stay schemin a rick ross song feature drake and french montana
the clip be a fuzzy michael mann rip off nighttime miami reduce to black gray and electric blue ooze sinister energy
in it drake don a black sweatshirt black jean black boot and a gold chain
he spend most of his verse star hard into the camera his eyebrow barely move
he gesture brusquely with a bandanna in his right hand
and he deliver what be easily the most tart harsh menacing verse of his career may look light but we heavy though
this come not even two month after the release of take_care drake 's masterpiece album of sensitivity and recrimination and it read like an almost total repudiation of it
that album be a bloodletting of heartbreak and anxiety while stay schemin be a firm punch to the jaw that become a staple at the same_time as some purple song from take_care
not only be drake write his_own narrative he be also write his_own counternarrative
it_' difficult to tell which of those be now the main plot both be in play on nothing be the same young money/cash money/republic drake 's third excellent major label album and the first to come as he be firmly ensconce in hip_hop 's top tier
before he be an interloper effect seismic change in hip_hop thanks to his dismantling of the usual facade of acquisitiveness and fearlessness
build on kanye west 's template of ambivalence drake take mr. west 's self examination and strip it of all its agitation preserve only the emotional turmoil
he want success and be aware of his more conventional competition but his concern be primarily internal
but drake be on top now the genre 's stylistic standard bearer and its most reliable and versatile hit maker and his concern have shift accordingly
on nothing be the same drake brood like before sure but also puff his chest in equal measure
he '_always use his music to send message to woman who have break his heart or whom he just could_not hold tight enough
now he ' get something to lord over them too
the musical choice be familiar hazy often doleful post soul and low end heavy hip_hop largely move slowly and with deliberateness
most of the album be produce_by drake 's longtime associate 40 who ' stick close to the sound that ' become their joint signature
the ache hit hold on we_'re go home recall find your love from 2010 pound cake be reminiscent of dreams money can buy from 2011
the most noticeable change in drake over the last couple of year have be physical not musical suddenly he ' muscle full of hard angle
the eye remain soft but everything around them have be remake
this be the externalization of the bravado that be now an essential part_of his music he ' brag plenty before but now it have weight
it_' probably worth mention the new_york nightclub altercation between drake 's crew and chris brown 's crew in_june 2012 when drake speak of it in a recent gq interview he have an ominous air as if anticipate how thing could get bad
but muscle aside there_' no real physicality to drake 's toughness
it_' a psychological evolution more_than anything the result of accept his stature as reality not just a dream
in the past lay himself bare have be the most natural thing
but when you_'re the object of ire and jealousy the apt response be to flash teeth and snarl a bit
the
nothing be the same tough talk begin several_month ago with the release of start
from the bottom like most of drake 's opening album single it_' far_more muscular than what appear on the rest of the album
it_' rousing and victorious there be not really much out here that ' pop off without us and also a bit malevolent
that be one of several song date back to stay schemin
in which drake put up his duke and prepare_for a fight the baleful 5am in toronto or his verse on the remix to versace by migos this_year i be eat your food and my table get so_many plate on it or the joyful flexing on asap rocky 's single the unprintable title of which shorten to problem

from indonesia and india to turkey and brazil capital flight from develop economy to the united_states be already cause hardship for million of business and worker
more be expect if the federal_reserve decide to retreat from its economic_stimulus campaign of buy billion of dollar in bond each month
that it decide on_wednesday not to stop may relieve some company government leader and economist who worry_that rise interest_rate in the united_states would draw ten of billion of dollar out of emerge_market and cause local currency to fall further against the dollar
investor have be move money into dollar base investment that offer high yield
but the fed_'s announcement wednesday afternoon take currency trader by surprise and the dollar plunge against major currency
the dollar fall a little more_than 1 percent against the euro and the yen after the announcement give company in the develop economy a little more breathing room
on_thursday currency in thailand indonesia the philippines and malaysia which have fall sharply in recent_month head higher with the indonesian rupiah gain about 1.5_percent against the dollar by late morning in asia
the economic slowdown in the develop economy seem less severe so_far than in other recent downturn
while previous exodus by investor from volatile emerge_market have cause wave of bank failure corporate bankruptcy and mass layoff the late retrenchment have be much milder so_far
that partly reflect the belief that when the fed do move it will scale_back its bond_purchase very gradually business leader and economist around the world say in interview this_week
the effect have also be limit partly_because bank company and their regulator in many emerge_market have become much_more careful about borrow in dollar over the last two_decade except when they expect dollar revenue with which to repay these debt
in 1997 and 1998 the whole problem begin with the banking sector
now i_think the banking sector be much better say sofjan wanandi a tycoon who be the chairman of the indonesian employers association and part owner of igp. trading in currency and stock_market seem to suggest_that some of the bad fear over the summer be start to recede
the brazilian real have recover about 8 percent of its value against the dollar since aug._21 and a little over a third of its loss since the start of may when worry begin to spread about the vulnerability of emerge_market to a tightening of monetary_policy
stock_market from india to south africa have rally from low in late_august with johannesburg 's market up 14.7 percent since late june after a swoon earlier than most emerge_market
while the fed have not start the taper process as yet there have be a considerable withdrawal of money in the emerge_market and especially in india since may.
in my opinion the major effect have_already take_place say sujan hajra the chief_economist at anandrathi an investment bank base in mumbai

tired of be thrust onto the front line of the nation_'s debate_over gun starbucks be ask customer to leave firearm behind when they be in its store and its outdoor seating area
the policy change come after a shooting_rampage at the washington_navy yard on_monday that leave 13 people include the gunman dead
but starbucks say its decision be not in response to that or to the shooting spree that kill 26 child and adult at the sandy hook elementary_school in newtown conn. just day_before christmas last_year
i_'ve spend a significant amount_of personal time on this issue in the last several_month and i have see the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it be on both_side howard schultz the chief_executive of starbucks say in a telephone_interview
nevertheless customer in many store have be jar and fairly uncomfortable to see gun in our_store not_understand the issue and feel that gun should not be part_of the starbucks experience especially when small kid be around
under the change baristas and other store employee will not ask customer who come in with gun in holster say to leave or confront them in any way mr. schultz say
no sign explain the policy will be post in starbucks_store either
we be go to serve them as we would serve anyone_else he say
there be go to be people on both_side who will be disappoint or angry but we_'re make a decision we think be in the best interest of our customer employee and the company
he say store official would evaluate compliance over time and consider post sign if_necessary
a majority of company own starbucks_store be in state that allow people to openly carry gun although restriction and limitation vary from state to state
the company have have a handful_of armed robbery in its store over the year as_well as two recent incident where gun carry in woman 's purse have discharge accidentally but little other gun_violence in its store
under its previous policy however starbucks have be unwillingly co opt by proponent of open_carry policy and vilify by those seek strict law on gun ownership
garry trudeau devote six consecutive day of his doonesbury comic strip in_2010 to mock the company 's stance which open with a barista greet a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and say welcome to starbucks sir
would you be openly carry a weapon today
pro gun activist have use our_store as a political stage for medium event misleadingly call starbucks appreciation day that disingenuously portray starbucks as a champion of open_carry mr. schultz write in an open letter to be publish in ad in major newspaper
last_month starbucks close a store in newtown early after gun right supporter wear camouflage and connecticut citizens defense league t_shirt hold one of their event there
similarly opponent of military style assault weapon in store like the group moms demand action for gun sense in america which advocate skip starbucks sundays have stag protest outside starbucks_store and urge consumer to boycott the company
in_2010 the brady campaign to prevent gun_violence team with credo action an activist group that use mobile technology and social_medium to push change and attract more_than 40,000 signature on a petition aim_at change the company 's policy on gun in its store that be deliver to starbucks headquarters in seattle
it sound_like howard schultz be make a very_good business decision say brian malte director of legislation and mobilization at the brady campaign
lot_of family with child college student and young_people be starbucks customer and they want_to feel safe
the company have long follow local law regard the ability_to carry gun in plain sight
customer in the 44 state that allow legal gun_owner to carry weapon openly have be permit in its store there while those in the six other state new_york california south_carolina illinois florida and texas have not accord_to the law center to prevent gun_violence
i_want to make it very clear that starbucks be not a policy_maker and as a company we be not pro- or anti gun mr. schultz say
however there have be a number of episode over the course of the last_few month that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open_carry
most other restaurant chain and retailer follow policy similar to the one starbucks be abandon although peet 's coffee and tea and california pizza kitchen ban gun from their store altogether
disney also forbid gun in its theme park and costco do_not allow its member to carry them openly in its store
while peet 's coffee and tea respect and value all individual right under the law like many other private retail establishment our policy be not to allow customer carry firearm in our_store or on our outdoor seating premise unless they be uniformed or identified law_enforcement officer the company say in a statement forward by a spokeswoman
a spokeswoman_for the national restaurant association say the organization do_not have a list of its member policy on gun but note_that some state that have open_carry law on the book still prohibit public display of firearm in restaurant
washington president_obama 's first two defense_secretary publicly question the administration_'s handling of the syrian crisis on_tuesday night and express skepticism about_whether russia can broker a deal to remove syria_'s chemical_weapon
in a joint appearance in dallas both former pentagon chief robert m. gates and leon e. panetta be critical of mr._obama for ask congress to authorize the use of force against syria in retaliation over its use of chemical_weapon
but they disagree on whether military_action would be an effective response
mr._gates say mr._obama 's proposed military_strike be a mistake while mr._panetta say it be a mistake not to carry_out an attack
my bottom line be that i believe_that to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple day to underscore or validate a point or a principle be not a strategy mr._gates say during a forum at southern methodist university
if we launch a military attack in the eye of a_lot of people we become the villain instead of assad he_add refer_to president_bashar al_assad of syria
mr._gates the only cabinet member from the administration of george_w. bush whom mr._obama ask to stay say missile strike on syria would be throw gasoline on a very complex fire in the middle_east
have n't iraq afghanistan and libya teach us something about the unintended consequence of military_action once it_' launch
mr._gates say
mr._panetta also speak at the forum say the president should have keep his word after he have pledge action if syria use chemical_weapon
when the president of the united_states draw a red_line the credibility of this country be dependent on him back up his word mr._panetta say
once the president come to that conclusion then he should have direct limited action go after assad to make very clear to the world that when we draw a line and we give our word then we back it up mr._panetta say
mr._gates and mr._panetta make their most extensive comment on current national_security policy and certainly their most critical statement on policy of the administration they both serve since leave public_service
both former secretary have announce_plan to publish memoir expect to shine more light on the internal policy debate of their tenure
neither express a specific reason for break their silence on the obama_administration 's decisionsâ tuesdayâ night
ask about the comment at a news_conference on_wednesday the current defense_secretary chuck hagel say he have the great respect for his two predecessor but add obviously i do_not agree with their perspective
another former high_rank obama_administration official michael_j. morell who recently retire as the deputy director of the c.i.a. also express skepticism about the negotiation broker by russia
i_think this be the syrians play for time mr. morell tell foreign_policy magazine in an_interview publish tuesday on its web_site
i do_not believe_that they would seriously consider give_up their chemical_weapon
mr._gates say he doubt whether president_vladimir v._putin of russia be sincere in his effort to broker a deal and say he be skeptical that the syrian_government would disarm
he say it be absurd that syria need day or week to identify the location and size of its chemical_weapon arsenal and he suggest_that the timetable should be an ultimatum of 48_hour
when ask whether the west should trust mr._putin mr._gates say be you kid me
he advocate identify credible partner within the syrian_opposition and increase support include weapon but not surface to air missile which could be seize by militant for terrorist act against civilian aviation
he also support a strategy of sanction that label member of the assad_government as war criminal with the threat of arrest if_they leave syria and suggest sanction on assad family_member live or study overseas include on their financial holding
such pressure may prompt some in the inner circle to negotiate an end to the civil_war mr._gates say
although mr._gates say that any unilateral military_action against syria would be a mistake he also say it be unwise for the president to have seek congressional authorization to use force because of the risk to presidential prestige if he be rebuff
if congress vote no it would weaken him mr._gates say
it would weaken our country
it would weaken us in the eye of our allies as_well as our adversary around the world
under question from the moderator david gergen who advise four president and be now on the faculty at the kennedy school of government at_harvard both former secretary say that american credibility on syria be essential to endure effort to prevent iran from build nuclear_weapon
iran be pay very close attention to what_we 're do mr._panetta say
there_' no question in my mind they_'re look_at the situation and what they be see right_now be an element of weakness
mr._panetta say that the president have to retain the responsibility and the authority on this issue and that it be wrong to subcontract the decision to congress
mr. president this congress have a hard time agree as to what the time of day be he say

new_york city_opera open its season on_tuesday night at the brooklyn_academy of music with the eagerly anticipate american premiere of the brilliant british composer mark anthony turnage 's anna_nicole
yes that anna_nicole
this audacious entertaining and in its strange way wrench opera tell of the real life playboy playmate reality television star and fortune hunter anna_nicole smith
yet hover over this exhilarating coproduction with the brooklyn_academy be the sad realization that anna_nicole could also be the only production of city_opera 's current season or even possibly the final offering in the history of this value 70-year old company
george steel city_opera 's general_manager and artistic_director recently announce that though all seven performance of anna_nicole would take_place the company would not be_able to present three other schedule production this_season unless it could raise $_7 million by the end of this_month
he_add that the company need another $ 13 million by year 's end to proceed with plan for 2014 15
if the rest of this_season and all of the next be cancel it be hard to imagine how the people 's opera could ever re emerge
many longtime supporter of the company be distress by the programming cutback in recent_year and by mr. steel 's decision to abandon lincoln_center and instead present production in various manhattan and brooklyn locale which he assert be more affordable
several production mr. steel present during his two season at_lincoln center 's renovate david h. koch theater and two nomadic season be innovative and exciting
but it have be hard for him to project a vision for city_opera when the company have no home and the offering be so few
anna_nicole show what_we will be miss if city_opera fold
the work be commission by the royal opera in london and have its premiere at covent garden in_february 2011
i attend that premiere fear the bad
i_think that mr. turnage his librettist richard thomas best_know for writing and composing
jerry springer the opera and the director richard jones would just make fun of smith
i be wrong
the three creator all british certainly have fun depict smith 's tawdry american life and skewer reality television
but their anna emerge as an improbable operatic heroine a restless woman yearn to escape her backwater birthplace mexia tex a striver determine to get ahead and raise a son in any way possible
be not this the american dream
the royal opera production with brash neon lighted set by miriam buether and colorful garish costume by nicky gillibrand look great on the stage at the brooklyn_academy
in this swiftly pace two act opera anna 's story be tell in flashback frame by a series of television interview
it begin with a gaggle of reporter who like a greek chorus come to tabloid journalism fill us in on the background story
mr. thomas 's word bop along often in loosely rhymed couplet
the language be clever and crass and mr. turnage set the chorus 's word in sputter burst of block chord
anna the appealing soprano sarah joy miller first appear her blond lock flow sit in a golden chair amid the reporter
ms. miller 's voice sometimes seem light for anna 's intense outburst and her top note be occasionally tight
but she easily dispatch the coloratura filigree of the vocal writing and bring sensual warmth and yearn to her win performance
you feel for this anna when she sing of her oppressive childhood with a brutish father the burly voice james barbour a foul mouthed mother the indomitable mezzo soprano susan bickley who make young anna swipe toilet roll from fast food joint and sundry relative include a female cousin who have five kid and no teeth
anna_nicole have prompt much talk in the opera world for the raunchiness of its libretto and the scene of sex and drug
yet every time the piece threaten to slip into smutty humor the creator especially mr. turnage tap the depth and sadness of anna 's story
a brainy modernist but also a lifelong jazz fan mr. turnage have write a score that bristle with jazzy energy touch of sardonic cabaret and stretch of bittersweet waltz
the music 's harmonic complexity and textural richness humanize anna and reach tragic realm in the final scene
the conductor steven sloane draw pulsing feisty and textured playing from the orchestra
the overall performance be mar though by what sound_like occasional feedback and crackle from an amplification system that seem to include microphone on individual singer
when anna have marry billy a guy she meet work at a fry chicken place and give_birth to a boy head to houston the city of joy as she imagine she wind up work in a walmart in a pathetically funny scene
she then take a job in a gentleman 's club where a veteran dancer teach her the crucial difference_between strip and lap dancing which be what they do
yet anna be not entice the moneyed clientele because as she come to realize her breast be too small
hence during a dizzying scene anna_nicole offer what have to be the first depiction in opera history of silicone implant surgery
the procedure do the trick

no aluminum in my backyard
some resident be upset about a plan to build a two story eight unit apartment house at 39th avenue and 50th street in the sunnyside_gardens historic district
what have galvanize opposition be a gesture that be suppose_to make the project palatable
in the crook of the l shape apartment house the architect frances campani and michael schwarting would reconstruct the vestige of the groundbreaking prefabricate all aluminum aluminaire_house of 1931
how can a house that in some way resemble a spaceship be plop down in the middle of this neighborhood ask city_councilman jimmy van bramer who_represent sunnyside_gardens
the proposal be schedule to go before the landmarks preservation commission on_tuesday
the aluminaire_house be first exhibit in the grand_central palace hall which once stand near grand_central terminal as a life size example of how industrial material could be use to build attractive affordable home
one architect interview by the new_york times say the light rectilinear effect of this house suggest the simple elegance of line of japanese house
the eminent architect wallace k. harrison buy the house 22 foot and 6 inch by 28 foot and 8 inch and move it to huntington n.y. where he alter and expand it
six_year after mr. harrison 's death in 1981 a new owner plan to demolish the house
paul goldberger then the architecture critic of the times sound an alarm on march 8 1987 say that nothing less be at stake than one of the pivotal work of modern architecture in america
in the end the new owner of the house donate it to the new_york institute of technology
mr. schwarting a professor of architecture at the institute enlist his student to help document and disassemble the building in 1988
the structure be later rebuild at the school 's central islip campus
last_year however no_longer be use for academic program and under attack by vandal the house be take down
it be now in storage
the institute have give the building to the nonprofit aluminaire_house foundation found by ms. campani and mr. schwarting wife and husband who be partner in campani schwarting architects of port jefferson n.y.
their search_for a new home for the aluminaire_house bring them to harry otterman
in 2007 mr. otterman buy a_lot at 39th avenue and 50th street that originally be a playground for youngster who_live in phipps garden apartments across the avenue
the playground be design by marjorie sewell cautley and still have feature like a sandbox pavilion and a wad pool basin even_though it have be close for many year
mr. otterman seek to develop the site with new housing
because the lot be in a historic district his plan must first be approve_by the landmark commission
add the aluminaire_house to the site be mean as an enticement to the commissioner
mr. schwarting acknowledge the difference_between a metal clothe house and the understated redbrick garden apartment and row house of the district
but he see the aluminaire_house as complementary to sunnyside_gardens
he say its architect albert frey and lawrence kocher have a_lot in common with clarence stein and henry wright who create sunnyside_gardens in the 1920s
no_matter how different the result they all care about find way to build welcome innovative and economical housing for work people
we feel pretty sure that once it_' there because it_' an_intimate little piece that it will function in the neighborhood as a landmark mr. schwarting say
the foundation would run the house as a museum
most neighbor seem unwilling to give the plan a chance
they object to the incongruity of the aluminaire_house the design of the new apartment_building which would be clothe in terra cotta panel and the loss of an open corner lot
there be even a movement afoot quixotic though it may be to acquire the property and transform it into a public space call cautley garden
herbert reynolds of the sunnyside_gardens preservation alliance frame the issue in term of conservation
we_'re try_to respect the plan community that clarence stein and his colleague entrust to us he say and
consistent mod handsome architecture plus liberal open space with toddler playground be very_much part_of that visionary plan
the head of two influential preservation group the historic districts council and the new_york landmarks conservancy say they do_not support the aluminaire_house plan
still almost everyone hop it will have another life
the aluminaire_house be architecturally significant councilman van bramer say
it should be restore and put on display for people to learn about enjoy and experience
however that should be do somewhere else

washington after three_year of cajoling finessing and occasionally strong arm his fitful conservative majority speaker_john a._boehner wave the white flag on_wednesday surrender to demand from his right flank that he tie money to keep the government open after sept._30 to strip president_obama 's health_care law of any financing
mr._boehner know that the plan he unveil can_not pass the senate and that it may prove unwise politically and economically
his leadership team press just last_week for an alternative
but with conservative force unite against_him he ultimately saw no alternative but to capitulate and few good option to stop a government_shutdown in two week
today be a step_forward and a win for the american people say representative tom graves the georgia republican whose defund obamacare push have amass 80 house supporter a bloc large enough to dictate the outcome
with much of the government set to run out of money at the end of the month and run out of borrow authority by mid_october mr._boehner face a choice he could steer a middle ground and find a way out of his fiscal dead end with republican and democratic vote or he could yield to a conservative movement to strip the affordable_care act of financing unite his republican majority around that war cry and hope for the best
house conservative let mr._boehner know that any solution that could_not attract a majority of the republican conference could cost him his speakership
divided senate republicans make_clear that link further government spending or a debt_ceiling increase to gutting the health_care law would never get through the senate
in march the speaker himself say do you_want to risk the full faith and credit of the u.s. government over obamacare
that ' a very tough argument to make
on_wednesday the speaker announce his choice
the law ' a train wreck he say
it_' time to protect american family from this unworkable law
the house 's stopgap spending measure would finance the government through_dec. 15 at the current spending level which reflect the automatic spending_cut that take effect in march know as sequestration while block the health_care law under which the uninsured will be enrol begin on_oct. 1
if the bill clear the house on_friday republican_leader could put forward a measure as soon as next_week that would raise the government 's statutory borrowing limit
that bill would also take aim_at the affordable_care act with a one year delay of its provision couple with a one year increase in the debt_ceiling
it would also expedite the construction of the keystone xl oil pipeline from canada to louisiana and set a timeline for an overhaul of the federal tax code and possibly include some other republican wish like specific spending_cut and regulatory change
for mr._boehner the announcement wednesday be a humbling moment and possibly a define one
since the tea_party wave sweep republicans to power in_2010 the beleaguered speaker have often find_himself at odds with the most conservative wing of his conference
in late 2011 he famously put his fractious conference on mute as he explain via telephone how it have to give_up its opposition to extend a cut in the payroll tax
three time this_year on major piece of legislation the speaker have put what he believe to be the great need of his country and his national party over those of his recalcitrant right_wing
in_january the house pass legislation to avert huge and sudden tax increase on virtually every american but let tax rise on the wealthy with democratic vote and a minority of vote by republicans
the same math pass relief for hurricane_sandy and a reauthorization of the violence against women act

the president of sudan want for year by the international_criminal court on charge of genocide and other crime in the darfur conflict set_off a grow storm of anger on_wednesday with his plan to attend the united_nations general_assembly as human_right advocate urge government to oppose the visit and the court 's judge ask the united_states to arrest him if he dare to come
american_official confirm on_tuesday that the sudanese leader omar hassan al bashir have submit a visa request to attend the general_assembly which run_through the end of the month
as the host country the united_states be oblige to grant visa to foreign head of state or representative who wish to attend the general_assembly regardless of their reputation or any dispute the american government may have with them
visa have historically be grant to world leader who be widely despised or mistrust in the united_states include fidel castro of cuba robert mugabe of zimbabwe mahmoud_ahmadinejad of iran hugo chã¡vez of venezuela and nikita s. khrushchev of the soviet_union
but mr._bashir 's case be different because he would be the first visitor to the united_nations with a stand warrant for his arrest by the international_criminal court at the hague
the court have accuse him of criminal responsibility for atrocity include genocide commit in the western darfur region of sudan where more_than 200,000 people be kill and more_than two million uproot by almost a decade of fighting between the government and rebel
american_official include samantha power the new american ambassador to the united_nations have denounce his plan to visit but it be unclear what they can do legally to block it
the united_states be not a member of the international_criminal court and be not bind by provision that require member to carry_out arrest_warrant on fugitive defendant
but the united_states be a member of the security_council which vote to refer prosecution for darfur atrocity to the international_criminal court and the american government have support the court 's effort to hold mr._bashir and others to account
ms. power say monday that instead of come to the general_assembly it would be more appropriate for him to present himself to the i.c.c. and travel to the hague
mr._bashir have make no secret of his contempt for the international_criminal court and have come to personify the problem of impunity that the court have increasingly confront in prosecute case
but a visit by mr._bashir to the united_nations which help to create that court would represent a new level of audacity
i_'m shocked by the fact_that he ' even think_about it say jordan paust a professor of international law at the law center of the university of houston
he really do seem to be thumb his nose at the u.n. and the obama_administration
the sudanese government which as of wednesday have not receive a state_department response to mr._bashir 's visa request castigate ms. power and other official who say he should not come
the president 's visit will be to the u.n. headquarters the foreign_ministry say in a statement
the host nation the united_states do_not have the legal right to object to the participation of any official from a full member state in the international organization in u.n. activity
the ministry add the government of the united_states be not qualified morally politically or legally to give advice on respect international humanitarian law and human_right in light of its well_know track record of commit war_crime and genocide against entire population the last be its invasion of iraq in 2003
alarm at the prospect that the united_states may have no choice but to grant mr._bashir a visa human_rights watch issue an urgent call on_wednesday for the security_council to publicly oppose his attendance
if al bashir turn up at the u.n. general_assembly it will be a brazen challenge to security_council effort to promote justice for crime in darfur say elise keppler the associate director of the international justice program at human_rights watch
the last thing the u.n. need be a visit by an i.c.c. fugitive
late wednesday the court 's judge also take the extraordinary step of ask the justice_department to take mr._bashir into custody if he proceed with the visit on the legal theory that even country that be not member of the court can decide to cooperate with it
in a statement the judge say inform by the office of the prosecutor of omar al bashir 's potential travel to the united_states of america they have invite the competent u.s. authorities to arrest omar al bashir and surrender him to the court in the event he enter their territory
in march 2009 judge at the international_criminal court order mr._bashir 's arrest charge him with war_crime and crime against humanity for play an essential role in the murder rape torture pillage and displacement of large_number of civilian in darfur
in_2010 the court issue a second arrest_warrant for mr._bashir this time on three count of genocide
while he have take some international trip since_then mr._bashir have be force to skip other event abroad because of the charge
in_july mr._bashir make a brief appearance at an african union summit meeting in nigeria but depart after human_right group file a lawsuit call for his immediate detention on an international arrest_warrant

in the most significant sign yet of a broad shift in the focus of alzheimer_'s research from treat to prevent the disease the federal_government announce on_wednesday its large grant so_far to test an alzheimer_'s drug on healthy people at great risk for the most_common form of the disease
the $ 33.2 million grant and several other prevention study award federal money in the last_year follow year of unsuccessful trial of treatment on people_who already have dementia
those failure have lead to the realization that these drug appear to be ineffective by the time memory and thinking problem have take hold
at the same_time scientific advance have allow researcher to identify people at risk for alzheimer_'s long before symptom emerge
with five million americans suffer from alzheimer_'s and their rank project to surge as baby_boomer age federal health official consider the disease such a priority that dr. francis s. collins director of the national institutes of health scrap money together when force budget_cut slash the obama_administration 's promise of $_100 million in additional funding for alzheimer_'s for 2013
dr. collins_say he dip_into the budget of the 27 n.i.h. agency to supply $_40 million award wednesday for several alzheimer_'s research project
another $_5 million be provide by the national_institute on aging
the bad_thing we could do would be to just hunker down and hold off tackle very_important problem dr. collins_say add obviously this be high risk research but goodness the stake be so high that we feel we have to go forward even in the face of the most difficult budget environment that anyone can remember in the n.i.h.
the idea be to approach alzheimer_'s with a strategy similar to that use for heart disease and other condition say laurie ryan program director for alzheimer_'s disease clinical trial at the national_institute on aging part_of the n.i.h.
we_'re go to look_at people at risk just like we do with people_who have high cholesterol and be at risk for cardiovascular disease she_say
if we intervene now can we prevent or at_least delay the disease
the $ 33.2 million grant part_of the government 's national alzheimer_'s plan will help finance a clinical trial to test a treatment on people 60 to 75 who have no symptom of the disease but do have two copy of a gene know to greatly increase the risk of get it as people age
the project lead by dr. eric m. reiman and dr. pierre n. tariot of the banner alzheimer_'s institute in phoenix will test a drug or placebo on 650 adult in several location mostly in the united_states
all of the participant will have two copy of the gene apoe4 have inherit it from both parent
study have find that more_than half the people with two apoe4 gene will develop alzheimer_'s compare_with about one fourth of people with one copy and 10_percent of people with no copy
people with two copy also develop symptom earlier around age 68 year before most people with one copy and more_than a decade before most people without the gene
people with two apoe4 gene make up only about 3_percent of the population but because_they develop the conventional late onset form of alzheimer_'s they be important to study
about 25_percent of people possess one copy of the gene
the banner project have not yet choose the drug to be test but it will be a treatment that attack amyloid a protein that accumulate in plaque in the brain of people with alzheimer_'s
expect to begin in 2015 the project will ultimately cost more_than $_100 million most of which be expect to be finance by the pharmaceutical industry with some money from nonprofit source dr. reiman say
researcher will use sophisticated test to measure whether the drug help delay memory or cognitive decline over five_year although dr. reiman say the test may be_able to record some result in as little as two_year
the study will also measure brain and neurological change over time
jamie tyrone 53 a retired nurse in ramona calif. say she feel traumatize when she learn while participate_in a different research effort that she have two copy of apoe4
for the first_time i_feel hopeful she_say

when terry francona spend last_season away_from the dugout as an analyst for espn he expect to gain perspective on life
he need the break after eight season of exhilaration and exhaustion as manager of the boston red_sox but his mind rarely stray from the only life he have know
i have no perspective francona say tuesday smile as he spit tobacco juice into a gatorade cup in the visit manager 's_office
there be no place he would rather be than here manage the cleveland indians in a pennant race
he '_pretty simple as far as how he go about his day it_' baseball baseball baseball say the bullpen coach kevin cash a former catcher for francona 's red_sox
whatever we_'re do we_'re talk_about baseball
we can be play card or watch tv but the conversation be always on this team
by now cash know that when the coach and francona agree to leave for the field at 11:30 a.m. francona will text them a half_hour early eager_to get go
francona be always comfortable at the ballpark and usually bore away_from it
yet as much as he love the game francona 's bitter exit from the red_sox make him wary of take just any job
the team have fold down the stretch in_2011 undo largely by a toxic clubhouse and the breakdown of trust between the front_office and the manager
he be sure it would not be like that in cleveland
francona have work there in 2001 as a special assistant in baseball operation
he know the team president mark shapiro and the general_manager chris antonetti
in time perhaps he could have build a strong relationship_with another management team
with the indians it be already there
i_want to be in a place_where i_think it would bring out the good in me francona say
so when i go in to interview with chris i know
it_' funny i hear people say
oh he know they be go to spend money or he would not have take the job
i never ask
the indians do spend last winter sign the free_agent michael bourn and nick swisher
both have have down year by their standard yet the indians be a half_game out of a wild_card spot after tuesday 's 5_3 victory_over the royals
the indians whose pitching have come on strong in the second_half play the lowly astros white sox and twins after this series
that give them a strong chance to make the playoff for the first_time since_2007 when francona 's red_sox stop them one win short of make the world series
we would not be where we be without tito antonetti say
the impact he ' make on our organization not just the major_league team have be profound
tito be the name of francona 's father an all_star outfielder for the indians in 1961 and the name baseball people use for terry
the decision to manage the indians have nothing to do with family history francona say but it make for a touching moment
francona do_not decorate his office at progressive field when the indians hire him last october
but when the team arrive there for its first home game in_april he find vintage family photo from cleveland on the wall
that ' the way this organization ' be francona say
it_' not family but it_' about as close as you_can get to that feeling
so i just want so bad to do the right thing
i get a little careful when they say i be change the culture or be responsible_for that
i_want to be a part_of that but it_' us do it together
it_' a complete team effort and that '_why it_' work
francona 54 mesh well in boston with theo epstein a much young general_manager who do_not play professionally
antonetti 38 fit the same description
he be an_assistant in 2001 when francona work for the indians and immediately win francona 's respect
antonetti be the smart person in the room francona say but never condescend
after his introductory news_conference in cleveland last fall francona fly to arizona with antonetti who have a home in goodyear where the indians train
francona stay over and fit right in
i_feel so comfortable i be walk_around his house in my underwear
francona say
there_' just no barrier
i can tell_him anything and i have and i know that when he leave my office he ' get my back

three_year ago one of the debate that preoccupy a certain stripe of hip_hop obsessive be the one over hashtag rap
that style now a relic refer_to the phenomenon of rapper conclude a series of line each with a single word
as if it be a hashtag that serve_as an imply wink
drake be maybe its high_profile proponent but big sean be generally credit with inject the style into hip_hop 's dna. that be probably the last moment in which big sean could take credit for beat drake somewhere the table have inexorably turn
listen_to beware the big single thus far from big sean 's new album hall of fame g.o.o.d./def jam a microscopically detailed look_at a fail relationship
it_' an incontrovertibly drake like song as be ashley another album highlight
for big sean a kanye west b teamer the only way forward it seem be to sound_like drake
drake in his_own way saw this come
every song sound_like drake feature drake he rap on 5am in toronto earlier_this year and while it be rap in anger you sense that drake enjoy see how indelible his mark have become
call it drakewave the movement of artist who be adjust their sound to better fit in drake 's footprint and the new artist who be arrive that way fully form
they_'re slowly remake the genre two actually hip_hop and r&b in his image
the drake template be clear a melange of singing and rapping a subdued moody musical atmosphere a fluency in feeling
the success of the weeknd would be unthinkable without drake
future 's evolution into hip_hop 's on call emoter be similarly a post drake phenomenon
drake be tour this fall with future and miguel in what will make for the year 's best de facto r&b lineup it would be second best have frank ocean not get sick and cancel his appearance on a bill with james blake at drake 's ovo fest last_month
and then there_' ovo sound the warner_brothers distribute label lead by drake and his team that so_far have two signees the singer partynextdoor who ' like a burlier less emotionally icy version_of the weeknd and majid jordan the dubby disco duo that feature on drake 's single
hold on we_'re go home
drake 's presence be feel in hip_hop as_well
whether through guest verse on song or by invite them to open for him on tour drake have have a hand in the ascent of nearly every relevant rise rapper of the last two_year meek mill kendrick lamar asap rocky 2 chainz
in the case of kyle there_' no direct connection to drake but the borrow dna be clear
beautiful loser indie pop/super duper kyle 's whimsical and loose debut_album be equal part mope and boast all deliver with a softness that feel very familiar
kyle 's extremely aware of the shadow he ' dodge on keep it real he rap they say i sound_like drake i do_n't
but kyle who both rap and sings doth protest too_much
after all last_sunday night when the drake album leak online he take to his twitter_account to tweet lyric from it just like all the other fan
beijing debt trail governor rick snyder to china last_week where he try_to entice cash rich chinese to invest in his state michigan and its tarnished jewel the bankrupt city of detroit
but here ' the odd thing it be not just the $_18 billion detroit owe that be on everyone 's lip or the financial restructuring under_way which seem to impress and provide the focus of much local coverage of the visit
instead chinese reporter want the governor 's advice on how china should handle its_own municipal debt the scale of which be unknown but may be large perhaps unmanageably large in some area
earlier_this year a former finance minister xiang huaicheng say local government debt may total as much as 20 trillion renminbi or about_$ 3.3 trillion accord_to reuters
to prevent the emergence of reproduction detroit in china audit team from beijing have fan out across the country in recent_week to check the book of local government and state run company several chinese news outlet quote the communist_party friendly hong_kong base ta kung pao newspaper as say
ta kung pao call it the big and most effective debt audit in chinese history
mr. snyder an accountant by training whose twitter username be @onetoughnerd be diplomatic about give advice when answer the first question from a chinese reporter at a medium event at the china club in beijing
i be proud to say i be the token accountant governor in the united_states he say
his translator look puzzled
yeah
the only one he_add helpfully
i may not be very exciting but we balance our book and pay our debt
point make
over all with respect to chinese municipality what i would say be i would not want_to speak about them specifically because one thing be there_' many way to deal_with debt question he say
detroit be relatively unique in term of have a huge debt burden
i would say that chinese municipality may find it interesting to watch how we handle thing in detroit because we be put in place a number of best practice to help better manage long_term debt as we emerge_from the restructuring he say
earlier in an_interview with american reporter mr. snyder have be a little more specific
be an old accountant i could probably put you to sleep he say
a key problem be that local government frequently build budget upon inaccurate revenue forecasting he say
so what they will do quite often be they will go_through a political process to come_up with what their revenue estimate be then discover it be an unreal assessment he say
that be the single most_likely area_where a municipality will blow it on a consistent basis
as any good business manager know a way to get out of debt be to increase revenue
and the governor be here not to dispense advice to china but to sell michigan and detroit
his pitch covered trade and tourism and it hit the spot in cultural term
chinese value fresh food want_to fish in one of michigan 's thousand_of lake then eat your morning catch for lunch
play golf or buy a waiting list only michigan make wristwatch
import blueberry an increasingly popular food here
how about a big slice of the global automotive business sum up by the legendary persona of hengli fute or henry ford a household name here
the state of michigan and detroit have an awful lot to offer be the carefully calibrate message
one of the thing i_think be really important be to recognize the comeback of detroit be already under_way he tell the american reporter
jobs be be create and building buy and there be even a squeeze on downtown and midtown housing he say
but there be also land for sale more_than 30 square mile or about 80 square kilometer
that may be something real_estate focus china would be interested_in but the governor seem careful not to appear too needy
he push back on the suggestion that detroit be a distressed asset
it_' the value place to go he say
not the distressed asset one i would not use the word distressed
it_' really a value opportunity
detroit be go to come_back in any case he say
what i would say be i_think chinese investment could be an_important influence and accelerator to the comeback
but again it be not a central piece of it but it could be a very helpful and useful piece that could be mutually beneficial
it be mr. snyder 's third trip to china in three_year take in chongqing and shanghai too and he have bring michigan businesspeople with him
there be also a foray to japan over a week in all
it be bill mostly as a relationship building exercise but there be already evidence of real chinese investment
in december chongqing helicopter investment company buy enstrom helicopter corporation in the city of menominee
in may work begin on an expansion expect to nearly double the size of its facility add 150 to 200 new job accord_to statement on the company web_site
but the tough edge of china 's development strategy long focus_on acquire technology from develop_country by any method necessary whether legal illegal or extralegal be also on display during the governor 's visit
you invite chinese company to invest in detroit and michigan a reporter for global times a nationalistic newspaper own by people 's daily the communist_party flagship say at the chinese medium event
do you think it be possible for the chinese company to get access_to some key technology in the u.s. company especially in the automobile sector
mr. snyder do_not directly answer that question instead underline that he would support chinese company in find talent and build their customer and supplier relationship the most_important thing for long_term business success

republican have accuse the administration of ignore request from american diplomat in libya for additional security in the month before the attack and of fail to launch a military response to blunt the attack once they be under_way
they also say the administration have place blame on midlevel official for mistake they say may have extend all the way to hillary_rodham clinton who be secretary of state at the time
the obama_administration and its democratic allies on capitol_hill have reject these criticism argue_that the state_department have move swiftly to carry_out 29 recommendation make by an_independent review panel in december to improve security and training
they have accuse republicans of politicize the attack for partisan gain

mr. kennedy respond that the four midlevel state_department official remove from their post and place on administrative leave last december have be reassign to job in which they no_longer have worldwide decision make authority for security
to me that be serious accountability mr. kennedy say
reassignment just do_not cut it mr. royce say
representative ileana ros lehtinen a florida republican add state continue to merely shuffle the deck chair
more broadly mr. kennedy say that despite improvement make by the department in the past several_month include additional marine corps security_guard and diplomatic_security personnel diplomacy abroad be an inherently dangerous job
we will do everything we can to deter and mitigate the effectiveness of any attack he say but we will not even with willing and capable government as our partner stop terrorist or extremist from mount attack against us in all case
the independent inquiry into the attack against the benghazi mission conduct_by a panel call the accountability review board that be lead by thomas r. pickering a retire senior diplomat blame the state_department 's diplomatic_security bureau and another department office for fail to coordinate and plan adequate security
the inquiry also find that several diplomatic_security official show poor leadership
as a result of the board 's recommendation the state_department by later this fall plan to have dozen of additional diplomatic_security agent at high threat embassy and million of dollar worth of advanced fire survival gear and surveillance camera in those diplomatic post
it also plan to improve training for employee head to the risky mission
but diplomat and lawmaker have warn it will take year and billion more dollar to fully carry_out the change call for by mr. pickering 's panel
the state_department late last_year appoint for the first_time a senior official a deputy assistant secretary of state to ensure_that embassy and consulate in dangerous place get sufficient attention
but a separate review panel lead by mark sullivan a former secret service director conclude this_month that with american embassy and consulate face an increase threat of terrorist attack the diplomatic_security office be mire in the department 's sprawling bureaucracy and must be elevate in importance
mr. sullivan 's panel recommend create a new under secretary job to oversee diplomatic_security a proposal mr. kennedy say be under review
mr. royce also raise_concern that a year after the attack in benghazi not one terrorist perpetrator have be capture or kill despite the president say that this be his high priority

after week of vociferous objection by faculty_member pennsylvania state_university say on_wednesday it be suspend part_of a new employee wellness_program that some professor have criticize as coercive and financially punitive
in particular the university say it be suspend a $_100 monthly noncompliance fee that be to be levy on employee who decline to fill out an online questionnaire
the form administer by webmd health services a health management company ask employee for intimate detail about their job marital situation and finance
it also ask female employee whether they plan to become pregnant over the next_year
last_week in an emotionally charged faculty senate meeting hold on the main campus several female professor tell administrator that require woman to answer such question or pay a fine amount to an invasion of their privacy
in a statement on_wednesday rodney a. erickson the president of penn_state say that the university have heed faculty concern_about the perceive invasiveness of the questionnaire and the punitive nature of the fine
we have decide to suspend the $ 100-per month surcharge so that people_who be uncomfortable with any aspect_of the survey will not feel as if_they be be penalize mr. erickson say in the statement
many employer use financial incentive to encourage employee to participate_in workplace wellness_program a trend that be likely_to widen with the new health_care law
under the wellness rule for the affordable_care act that take effect next january company can offer a reward of up to 30_percent of health cost for employee who complete a participatory program like a risk assessment or biometric test like waist measurement
but the uproar at penn_state illustrate the pitfall employer can face in impose incentive base wellness_program without first obtain employee support
on a large level it suggest_that employer increase effort to cut their health_care cost be on a collision course with employee boundary about medical privacy
the big picture here be that with the affordable_care act the amount_of the incentive have grow significantly and employer be jump into this say michael o'donnell the director of the health management research center at the university of michigan
we be go to see stop and start as people figure_out how to do that
penn_state adopt the wellness_program which currently apply to nonunion employee include professor and staff at the recommendation of highmark health services a company that administer penn_state 's health_care claim
that lead some faculty_member to criticize administrator for adopt a wellness_program without seek input on its design from outside expert
in its statement on_wednesday the university say it would now form a joint task_force with faculty_member to seek expert advice on both the adoption of the wellness_program and health benefit matter generally
industry expert also say penn_state stumble by use a stick rather_than a carrot approach to motivate employee
professor complain for_instance that the $_100 monthly fine seem_like a strong arm tactic consider that some employee earn less_than $ 50,000 annually
the original plan come under heavy criticism last_weekend on social_medium
wellness plan cause trouble dr. eric topol a prominent cardiologist post on his twitter feed
a better model desperately need
i_'d object to webmd 's wellness questionnaire too janice mccallum a health data marketing strategist post on_twitter
penn_state institute the wellness plan in an effort to slow double_digit annual growth in its health expenditure
the university be self insure which mean that it directly cover the health cost of some 40,000 employee spouse and dependent at an estimated cost this fiscal_year of $ 217 million
penn_state faculty_member welcome the university 's decision to suspend the noncompliance fee and to set_up a task_force to seek faculty input on possible alternative
by remove the penalty at_least temporarily they have remove the sticking point that be the big concern for employee say matthew c. woessner an associate professor of political science
it give us hope that whatever future program they undertake it will be undertake with due diligence and high ethical standard

the united_states britain france and human_right and nonproliferation group also say that the report 's detailed annex on the type_of weapon use the large volume of poison_ga they carry and their trajectory lead to the conclusion that the force of mr._assad be culpable
the russian criticism come as the united_nations security_council 's five permanent member begin a second day of talk on a draft resolution aim_at ensure_that the syrian_government honor its commitment to identify and surrender all chemical munition for destruction step it officially agree to take under a deal negotiate saturday by russia and the united_states that avert a punitive american missile strike on syria
russian news_report quote the country_'s deputy foreign_minister sergei a. ryabkov as say during a visit to damascus that syria_'s government have provide additional information that show insurgent use chemical_weapon not only on_aug. 21 but also on other occasion
the syrians offer no such information to the united_nations chemical_weapon inspector before they leave syria with a trove of forensic sample on_aug. 31
the inspector have say they will return to syria to investigate other report instance of chemical_weapon use but no date have be announce
mr. ryabkov speak after meet with mr._assad and his foreign_minister walid al moallem
he do_not disclose the precise nature of the additional information the syrians have convey to him but he be blunt about his criticism of the report present on_monday at the united_nations
we be unhappy about this report mr. ryabkov say in remark broadcast by the state television network rt.
we think that the report be distort
it be one sided
the basis of information upon which it be build be insufficient
he also say russia need to learn and know more on what_happen beyond and above that incident of aug._21
russia 's foreign_minister sergey_v. lavrov have also question the united_nations report though not as harshly
mr._lavrov who broker the deal_with secretary of state_john kerry to put syria_'s chemical_weapon under international supervision say tuesday that there be still serious ground to believe_that the aug._21 attack be a provocation carry_out by the rebel
as he have many time mr._assad in an_interview conduct tuesday and broadcast wednesday on fox news deny that his government be responsible_for the attack
we do_not use any chemical_weapon outside damascus he say
mr._assad also say syria would comply_with the chemical_weapon agreement which he estimate would cost_$ 1_billion and take about a year
ask about the russian criticism martin nesirky a spokesman_for ban ki moon the united_nations secretary_general say it have be clear to everyone that the chemical_weapon inspector be focus first on the aug._21 attack because of its magnitude and be plan to return to syria to investigate other accusation with a more comprehensive report to follow
mr. nesirky also take issue with the russian portrayal of the report as biased
the finding in that report be indisputable he say at a midday briefing
this be a thoroughly objective report on that specific incident
foreign_minister laurent fabius of france who have just visit with mr._lavrov react angrily to the russian accusation say they have surprise him
nobody can question the objectivity of the people appoint by the u.n. mr._fabius be quote by agence france presse
russia which like the other permanent security_council member have veto power be resist coercive language in the draft offer by the western member that could lead to military intervention in syria
the russian position appear intend_to sow enough doubt to call into question additional pressure_on syria_'s government and perhaps to cloud evidence_that at_least some of the country_'s arsenal be of soviet origin

and the visible bra surely be even for the flashy wearer well past its sell by date

we be in a period of weak demand frederic gagey the airline 's chief_executive say after a three hour meeting with air_france employee council
we be face the full brunt of the cyclicality of air transport
like many company in europe air_france continue to struggle in the face of a weak economy and rise unemployment
the airline announce 5,100 job cut in_june 2012 part_of a broad restrucuring plan at the parent company the french dutch group air_france klm. alexandre de juniac the chief_executive of air_france klm say the group would probably report a net loss for 2013 a sixth consecutive annual loss fall_short of an initial goal of break even
but he expect the additional measure will restore the company to profitability by the end of 2014
respond to pressure from the socialist government in france to avoid job loss air_france say the late staff reduction would be achieve largely through a mix of voluntary departure early retirement attrition and reduce work hour
negotiation with union on the new cut will begin on_oct. 4 the company say
i believe the whole company be mobilize to confront this second challenge mr._de juniac say
air_france which have some of the high labor cost among european airline have struggle to remain competitive in the face of the region 's prolonged economic downturn stubbornly high fuel expense and fierce competition from the region 's low cost carrier
rapidly expand carrier in asia and the gulf region be squeeze full service carrier like air_france lufthansa and british airways on long distance route
michel salomon a spokesman_for the air_france branch of the union the confederation franã§aise democratique du travail acknowledge_that the current economic situation have leave air_france in fragile health and that significant reduction be unavoidable
but he question_whether management 's target could be achieve solely through voluntary mean
the number be extremely heavy he say
without offer extremely attractive term there be no guarantee that they will be_able to avoid layoff
air_france be one of several european flag carrier overhaul their operation by reduce flight and shut_down unprofitable route while increase investment in low cost subsidiary that compete head to head with the like of ryanair and easyjet
but analyst_say pressure from the french government which own a 15.9 percent stake in air_france to limit layoff last_year may have lead management to be less aggressive in its initial restructuring plan
the first wave be not sufficient to reach the target set by the company say yan derocles an airline analyst at oddo securities in paris
they may have be a bit timid he say note_that compare_with peer like lufthansa of germany or british airways there be still a huge gap in term of the flexibility of employee the number of hour for the pilot and cabin crew etc
mr._de juniac concede wednesday that the plan announce last_year have not go far enough
the new measure which he vow would be sufficient be expect to yield an additional 400 million euro to 450 million euro or $ 534 million to $ 601 million in cost saving by the end of 2014
despite the slow than expect progress the airline 's overhaul have begin to bear fruit

it_' unusual to be a fashion family come from ireland and then my_dad be chinese
the designer discuss a childhood where everyone in a house fill_with artist and musician seem to be a character and how that give her a taste for originality and independence

but it_' a really special place ireland so rich culturally so human
the simone rocha show on the close day of london_fashion week be a fine example of that meld of strong spirit couple with high quality from the family atelier
she be train first in dublin and then in london at central saint martins where the guidance of louise wilson who direct the master 's course at the prestigious fashion school bring out a strong focus
or as the designer put it after two_year with louise i know my_own identity exactly what i_want to say with my clothes
i be naturally attract to feminine thing but i_want to bring them somewhere different or to put_together in a wrong way ms. rocha say
this show her seventh be about that edgy femininity where black dress light in weight and with crunchy or shiny surface work through to a feather light gilded brocade look material
the fabric be mostly undefinable material like patent cotton and flower embroider plastic that she and her team develop work with mill in a spirit of modernity
then as always there be the classic pearl her signature motif milky white against the black and inject a serene prettiness by edge knee high stocking or decorate chunky accessory
her shoe be already collector item
it be rare for an emerge designer to have such a clear vision
the show seem to contain her life circle where she now live in the gritty edginess of dalston in london 's rundown east end even_if ms. rocha have just move into a spanking new studio with her tiny work force create crochet craftwork under frame image of francis bacon 's gut wrench art
then there be her irish side which come_out in the show in the sudden appearance of a coat in dark rain soak leaf green and veil like religious habit but in flesh color tulle with a white cotton frill
in her program she describe inspiration as mourning communion isolation union
there be no specific sign of her half asian background even_though she have visit hong_kong every year since her childhood to see her grandparent and now 13 cousin
but it can_not be a coincidence that like so_many fresh young designer in america asia be part_of her dna. mr. rocha who have receive recognition from the british government for service to fashion say that the hard thing for him be not to be_able to help or direct his daughter but to let go
i can_not do_anything

she have her_own voice
ms. rocha 's brother work on the music side be also part_of the family mix
i really want independence and of course like everyone we have family fight she_say
we may want_to do thing differently but we never come to blow

the policy change come after a shooting_rampage at the washington_navy yard on_monday that leave 13 people include the gunman dead
but starbucks say its decision be not in response to that or to the shooting spree that kill 26 child and adult at the sandy hook elementary_school in newtown conn. just day_before christmas last_year
i_'ve spend a significant amount_of personal time on this issue in the last several_month and i have see the emotionally charged nature of this issue and how polarizing it be on both_side howard schultz the chief_executive of starbucks say in a telephone_interview
nevertheless customer in many store have be jar and fairly uncomfortable to see gun in our_store not_understand the issue and feel that gun should not be part_of the starbucks experience especially when small kid be around
under the change baristas and other store employee will not ask customer who come in with gun in holster say to leave or confront them in any way mr. schultz say
no sign explain the policy will be post in starbucks_store either
we be go to serve them as we would serve anyone_else he say
there be go to be people on both_side who will be disappoint or angry but we_'re make a decision we think be in the best interest of our customer employee and the company
he say store official would evaluate compliance over time and consider post sign if_necessary
a majority of company own starbucks_store be in state that allow people to openly carry gun although restriction and limitation vary from state to state
the company have have a handful_of armed robbery in its store over the year as_well as two recent incident where gun carry in woman 's purse have discharge accidentally but little other gun_violence in its store
under its previous policy however starbucks have be unwillingly co opt by proponent of open_carry policy and vilify by those seek strict law on gun ownership
garry trudeau devote six consecutive day of his doonesbury comic strip in_2010 to mock the company 's stance which open with a barista greet a customer in a plaid flannel shirt and say welcome to starbucks sir
would you be openly carry a weapon today
pro gun activist have use our_store as a political stage for medium event misleadingly call starbucks appreciation day that disingenuously portray starbucks as a champion of open_carry mr. schultz write in an open letter to be publish in ad in major newspaper
last_month starbucks close a store in newtown early after gun right supporter wear camouflage and connecticut citizens defense league t_shirt hold one of their event there

customer in the 44 state that allow legal gun_owner to carry weapon openly have be permit in its store there while those in the six other state new_york california south_carolina illinois florida and texas have not accord_to the law center to prevent gun_violence
i_want to make it very clear that starbucks be not a policy_maker and as a company we be not pro- or anti gun mr. schultz say
however there have be a number of episode over the course of the last_few month that have put us in a position to take a big step back and assess the issue of open_carry
most other restaurant chain and retailer follow policy similar to the one starbucks be abandon although peet 's coffee and tea and california pizza kitchen ban gun from their store altogether
disney also forbid gun in its theme park and costco do_not allow its member to carry them openly in its store
while peet 's coffee and tea respect and value all individual right under the law like many other private retail establishment our policy be not to allow customer carry firearm in our_store or on our outdoor seating premise unless they be uniformed or identified law_enforcement officer the company say in a statement forward by a spokeswoman
a spokeswoman_for the national restaurant association say the organization do_not have a list of its member policy on gun but note_that some state that have open_carry law on the book still prohibit public display of firearm in restaurant

before ronan noone 's play the compass rose begin you wait to see if life will subtly transform into theater
you look around the bar that be its site specific setting and take note of the detail
will the bartender who can flip a shot glass in the air and catch it behind his back become a character
will the atmosphere in the room shift from cozily humdrum to ritually charge
alas no such magic occur
the compass rose a disappointing two character drama that be part_of the annual 1st irish festival start as play do with a warning about cellphone
then there_' a harsh change in lighting and we_'re off
david mitchell play donal an irish immigrant and a bartender
good_thing he ' not a butcher or a sanitation worker
and olivia horton be tiffany the spoiled american who invite him along for a cross country car trip
they squabble and flirt and fall in improbable love before she abandon him in las_vegas
ten year_later when she show up in his bar he ' still pin for her
on_sunday night mr. mitchell and ms. horton never seem particularly comfortable roam the bar cum theater ryan 's daughter on east 85th street
sometimes they be very close to audience member during one scene my view be of the thin wale on the seat of mr. mitchell 's corduroy but their self consciousness be infectious
people tend_to look away when the action be too near them as if_they do_not want_to intrude on actor act
not that the compass rose direct_by david sullivan would be much better on a traditional stage
it have a hole where its emotional heart should be
the main problem be tiffany tiffany jones no less a teasingly inaccessible and self satisfied princess
perhaps to donal she ' as much a vision of america attractive callow materialistic as she be a person
either way his interplay with her be unconvincing and their romance hard to credit
the tone of wistful mourning for lose love lose illusion never jell
all you_can think be donal you dodge a bullet

touch screen phone have become so astonishingly good at some task they have all but replace landline phone pocket camera and printed map
but there be one feature that they still struggle to get right the keyboard
the flexibility of the full touch screen have win out over tactile physical button leave us with a keyboard that be just an image on glass and small key that sometimes get cranky around big thumb
still user do_not have to settle for the default keyboard on their smartphone
the advantage to virtual keyboard be just that they be virtual and can be easily swap or alter for one you like better
sometimes all it take be a change in your setting
at most it require buy an app
here ' a sampling of tip and apps to help improve your typing experience on apple ios and android the two most_popular operating system for smartphones
fewer tap many smartphone user make the mistake of tap out whole word one letter at a time
a quick way to speed_up type on almost all phone be through predictive text
once the feature be turn on the device will predict what word you be type after fill in only a letter or two
choose the full word take just a single tap
to turn on predictive text you will have to dig through the menu under setting
look for the keyboard option and select auto correction or whatever the similar name be on your phone
then start type and when the complete word appear usually in a list just above the keyboard tap it
the best part be the prediction usually improve over time as the device learn which word you prefer
so the more you use it the more time it will save you
another option be use a nonstandard keyboard layout like the one provide by fast keyboard a free app for apple product
with the app you wo_not need to keep switch the keyboard from letter to number they all appear on the same screen
symbol key like hashtags appear on the screen too and cut copy and other function be also within reach
the downside of the app and other auxiliary keyboard for apple product be that it do_not completely replace the default keyboard
it can be use for certain apps like e_mail text messaging and social_medium
android replacement keyboard can work with all of its function and apps
fleksy a free iphone app mean to help the visually impair can help you type without look_at all
just approximate tap where you think letter belong on a keyboard
when you have complete a word flick the screen to the right
fleksy will read its guess aloud
flick down for it to guess similar word
the sloppier you be the better it seem to work
but as with other auxiliary iphone keyboard it can_not completely replace the standard keyboard
handy code
if_you find yourself repeatedly use the same phrase over and over and who do_n't
so_call typing expansion program be for you
when use these program you assign an abbreviation like omw to automatically turn_into i_'m on my way home honey need anything
type expansion be build into apple product and the free android app google keyboard
for apple product go to setting then select general and then keyboard
click
add a new shortcut then enter the abbreviation and phrase you_want it to become
in google keyboard open the app and go to personal dictionary
touch the plus sign and then add your abbreviation and phrase
press do and the back button
one tip for all the device make_sure your shortcut use unusual letter combination so you do_not activate phrase at unwanted time
gestures gesture keyboard figure_out what you mean to type as you to trace your finger loosely over the key
it be fast than single letter typing but before it become really accurate it have to learn your pattern
sometimes the process can be exasperating
one keyboard developer say it take at_least 50 message for these program to learn your pattern
swiftkey a $ 4 app for android have an additional way to increase accuracy right off the bat
give the app access_to your facebook twitter and gmail account and it will observe your vocabulary to better anticipate word you be likely_to use
it have recently add a cloud backup service that save your personal dictionary of often use phrase in case your device be lose or die
it also search the web for phrase come into heavy use like sarin twerking or middleton to better guess what you be type
swype a popular $_1 gesture base keyboard app for android can also check your facebook twitter and gmail account to improve accuracy but it have long have a feature call live language activate it to anonymously collect new and unfamiliar word from across the web and add them to the dictionary
many phone already have gesture type if_you look in the setting
usually it be under a heading like language and keyboard or language and input
for apple product there be swiftkey and swype imitator but like the previously mention fleksy they can be use only for write text
privacy settings
there be a potentially alarming side to predictive technology
it be possible for an app to collect data that you would not want it to
here be a warning that appear when instal google keyboard this input method may be_able to collect all of the text you type include personal data like password and credit_card number
it come from the app google keyboard
use this input method
while reputable developer will tell you in their privacy policy that they do_not collect credit_card and password you_can take step on your_own
turn_off the option that share to the cloud will increase your security at the sacrifice of some accuracy by keep your personal dictionary on your phone only
then be sure to lock your phone

the late designer store to join the bustling retail scene that surround howard street in soho an area pioneer by open ceremony be around the corner at 148 lafayette street
if the address ring a bell that be because it have appear for 17 year on the label of one of fashion 's quiet success story
lafayette 148 as the company be know be so quiet that you will not even notice the store from the street it be on the eighth floor and as yet there be no sign
though it start with several store in the new_york area in the late 1990 the company know primarily for career orient sportswear that be originally manufacture at its soho headquarters have focus for the last decade on its department_store business and its_own online and catalog sale
now it have 1,500 employee and a state of the art factory in shantou china

but still customer show up at the office on lafayette street look for a store
so it all point in one direction say deirdre quinn the chief_executive and a founder of lafayette 148 with shun yen siu her partner in china
earlier_this year as floor become available in the building lafayette 148 which maintain_its showroom administrative office and sample make facility there expand
the eighth floor be choose for the store ms._quinn say to_reflect its symbolism for luck in chinese culture
it be for the same reason that the price of all of its design end in an eight
and with 4,000 square_foot the company be_able to create the kind_of environment that be not possible in a traditional department_store with a full range of size include petite and plus size category that have largely be drop by manhattan retailer
the store which be open to the public on weekday begin this_week and also by appointment be an experiment for customer as much as it be a showcase for the retailer who shop the line there
in this setting lafayette 148 can present the line as it would want show luxury item and jewelry and calfskin tote even custom evening dress not just the $ 248 white shirt in stretch cotton for which it be know
of its more_than 100,000 online customer about 10_percent live in the metropolitan region but many of them still want_to try on clothes before buy
rather_than opening in every mall in america we_want to find our own path say paul lechlinski the company 's vice_president for retail service

there be also some serious statement jewelry like an 18-karat gold plat brass necklace that resemble a sea anemone
a department_store may be nervous about order many of these design but the company can still produce them in limited quantity in as little as three week
while there be an obvious risk that no_one will recognize there be a store upstairs ms._quinn say there be other advantage to be in the same building in which the product be design
alteration for_example can be handle by the original patternmaker downstairs
and if customer want a sneak preview of spring they can always stop by the showroom on 2

there be time during tuesday_night 's fabulously entertaining new_york philharmonic concert at avery fisher hall when i find_myself debate the pro and con of the conceit behind hitchcock the first of two program in the art of the score film week at the philharmonic
under the direction of constantine kitsopoulos the philharmonic perform extract of score to hitchcock classic include vertigo
north by northwest and stranger on a train as scene from the film play on a large screen above
from the side of the stage the actor alec baldwin provide introduction and insightful commentary
if the plan be to attract large_number of philharmonic newbie with a combination of contemporary celebrity sparkle and old hollywood polish it work the hall be pack and the crowd as diverse as any i have see at_lincoln center
present a week before the official opening of the season film week which also include performance of stanley kubrick 's 2001 a space odyssey be like a platter of delicious amuse bouches design to drive traffic to the more substantial fare
but with alfred hitchcock 's genius compete for attention be anyone really listen_to the orchestra
as cary grant in a scene from to catch a thief streak over the roof with catlike grace while french detective roar through the countryside in hot pursuit of a car that sacre bleu
carry only the housekeeper do anyone pay_attention to the rhythmical verve and bite humor of lyn murray 's score
when grace kelly wrestle with the nighttime attacker send to strangle her in dial m for murder do anyone notice the orchestra 's glorious sound in dimitri tiomkin 's dark and powerful score with its allusion to the coronation scene from mussorgsky 's boris godunov
as mr. baldwin point_out hitchcock be deeply serious about music in his film recognize its power to express character hidden desire and weave it into a movie so skillfully that it become ingrained in the visual fabric
the score to his film also become important marketing tool
a symphonic suite base_on the score of rebecca be widely tour after the movie 's release in the case of spellbound the score in a recording conduct_by leopold stokowski be broadcast on the radio even before the film 's release
one of the most fruitful collaboration be that between hitchcock and the composer bernard herrmann who compose score for seven hitchcock film include psycho north by northwest and vertigo
in the last film especially herrmann 's music establish a vocabulary of psychological state that be then use to underscore or undermine the character action the dizzy triplet denote vertigo the screech dissonant chord express the terror as the protagonist dangle from a tall building peer down into the abyss the luscious sigh string that accompany the obsessive love story
the philharmonic play the score to the vertigo hotel scene with wagnerian urgency
the string produce a gorgeous rich sound that cool into a light queasy timbre as james stewart stand at the window bath in green neon light
at that moment the concert feel_like more_than a case of luxury casting and become a vindication of the always self efface but often brilliant work of film composer
2001 a space odyssey will be present with live music from the new_york philharmonic conduct_by alan gilbert on_friday and saturday at avery fisher hall lincoln_center 212 875 5656 nyphil.org
london this_week tom ford open his 89th store in london where his company have its headquarters
we_'re in baku he say as he reel off city that presumably will carry his mirror spangle dress next_spring
for its show burberry invite the impossibly cute harry styles of one direction and the it girl suki waterhouse
england be home to some world conquer fashion brand that derive a_lot of their success from retail expertise and so_call entry point product like perfume and sunglass
as it happen both mr. ford and christopher bailey of burberry make strong statement on their runway
in fact mr. ford say he be really into an athletic look woman hence the exaggerated shoulder of his leather outfit the tapered waist and the leggy skirt
i be not think_about 80 supermodel he say
pour into evening outfit that look as if_they be shoot out of a can of black silly string and then seemingly bake with a girdle of foil his model definitely be more molten than glamorous
mr. ford 's spring daywear such as it be consist of buckle tight brown or white leather jacket cinch black pantsuit and a slinky leather mesh tank top with a black and white leather skirt in a bubble pattern
those outfit echo his day at gucci
but the evening clothes be in new territory both in term of style and technique
the one pave with glitter fragment be a bit elvis or rihanna but they dissolve conventional line between dress up and performance
that ' not trivial when you consider how dull most red_carpet fashion be
mr. ford say he get the idea for the mad squiggle and break bit from the work of artist he admire like jose parla and mark bradford
you will have to take his word for it that get into a cobweb be a cinch
mr. bailey 's collection be more accessible
for starter he call it english rose
aside from the pink and custard tone the clothes nicely combined tradition and modern styling lace for pencil skirt be produce in nottingham england
he show them with shirt or plain cashmere sweater
and instead of reinvent the trench coat in a gazillion fabric as he have do before he give the audience a breather with soft roomy coat in all those melt english color
of course many_people count on london for more_than a garden party
yet this be a tough season for young designer who once have a novel idea like the ecstatic print of mary katrantzou and now seem to be toil in the same path
ms. katrantzou create print from blow_up image of shoe but her fussy shape hold her back
i keep wonder_why she do_not try softer thing like pajama pant and tunic
erdem be another label determine to make a shrine out of couture too_many veiled garment
as i go around london to place and street fill_with ordinary people i have the sense more_than ever that fashion here be take_place in vacuum
do they care about christopher kane 's naã¯ve drape and twisted flower dress
or j. w. anderson 's break_down skirt or dress with panel array with row of what resemble tiny takeout box in fabric what he call avant bland
if the public do_not appear to be even remotely listen whom be we talk to
i actually blame the young star
they be not be as innovative as they need to be
it_' that simple
you_can fool the fashion press with a gimmick or a cool bit of styling but you_can not fool ordinary people
and the public always recognize heart stop fashion as it do for designer from chanel to mcqueen
mr. kane have some lovely thing pleated skirt in delicate slightly shimmery fabric a black pantsuit and some pastel dress with petal shaped cutout rim in silver
but he spread himself too thin
he show sweatshirt with feminine skirt a style similar to one he have do in the past
last_year it be a frankenstein t_shirt with a lace skirt
but since riccardo tisci of givenchy make a big statement for fall with the same sweatshirt look maybe mr. kane should have move on
when i look back over his last four or five collection there_' a clear evolve body of design
this time i_saw too_many trick like dress with cord suspend draping
he show some shift crowd with abstract flower applique and lace arrow
he have work with lace and applique before
but again be he advance the idea or merely amplify it
in may raf simons create a dior resort collection with floral embroider lace
mr. anderson owe a clear debt to the japanese designer of the 80
and it_' o.k. to be inspire_by them who have not be but he run the risk of serve up avant garde lite
also base_on thing i see of his in store he be quite a clever designer so i do_not understand the need for all the runway craftiness unless it_' just to get medium attention
thomas tait by_contrast do a_lot with a little
he use white leather superfine knit some feather and athletic nylon and create an elegant thoroughly unpretentious collection
though the fabric be mostly practical they_'re beautifully cut
he too like a skirt and a top maybe with a lightweight coat but he bend the look to his aesthetic
it_' not a 50s pencil skirt it_' loose almost runny
if i_saw a woman in these clothes i would be curious
also worth pay_attention to next_spring be simone rocha for her pretty full skirt dress trace with pearl jonathan saunders for a broad use of sporty separate like boyish tricolor suede jacket and satin short and paula gerbase of the minimalist label 1205 who have an implacable eye for proportion
the meadham kirchhoff designer get a little kitschy with their europa fairy_tale but they make gingham and white eyelet skirt look tempting
their jacket be handsome too
round out the show be l'wren scott 's use of tagasode whose sleeve 16th_century japanese screen depict garment drape on stand as if wait for their occupant to return
well there_' a sorcery quality in her femininity too and she bring it out with vivid red fan pattern black lace and a crisp silhouette for daytime tweed and cotton
bill callahan may be easy to describe by what he be not_quite a folkie a country singer a cloistered primitivist weirdo with a four track recorder a poet or some other kind_of word only artist
over the last 23 year on a string of record make almost exclusively for the chicago label drag city you sense that he ' walk past those door revise his idea wait look for something
he ' find it
listen through his astonishing new album dream river and you will hear line up neatly his trademark
they have be float around in his work recently though perhaps not so deliberately they do_not seem_like trademark until_now
but dream river be evidence of a system a work formula
here be mr. callahan 's baritone voice float lightly in middle range and make quick and confident deep dive put strange bend on a phrase
here be an image of a man alone in a hotel_room image of eagle and water in fact of an eagle fly over water alive and enjoy the ride
the idea of motion for its_own sake be another callahan trademark
a ripple phase effect on mr. callahan 's rhythm guitar strumming like waylon jennings have in the mid-'70
a small band with minimal percussion sometimes only conga and clave stick play spacious and ominous live arrangement in waltz or habanera through song that pause and turn in strange place
word or expression ritually express in two or three
and a narrative action first describe and then imitate like this from the album 's first track the sing the only word i have say today be beer and thank_you beer
/thank you/beer
thank_you beer
mr. callahan be now 47 and have be base in austin tex
for almost a decade
in the frequently scrappy or bitter music he make under the name smog begin in 1990 and then since he start use his_own name on record in 2007 he ' be change ensemble sound and strategy make his work more country or less more minimal or less more disruptive or less
his work have suggest a great struggle to make song that be both emotionally affect and explosion of imply meaning a kind_of semantic epistemological metaphysical event
he seem to want_to put everything in them now love death fear patience transfiguration
he just do_not want_to say any of it outright
this level of subtlety be not common in pop
plenty_of songwriter be oblique but mr. callahan want_to connect
his record be literary without have a_lot of word they_'re methodical slow drip of charge idea that settle in the brain like a long poem or a novel
this one in particular be almost transparent a wind blow through it
with a group of austin musician that have become more stable over the last_few album he ' make a complex procedure sound easy
mr. callahan 's introverted voice refine as it have become over the year may never lose its essential awkwardness he can still use it perversely
this record 's final song winter road have a smash closer on paper i have learn when thing be beautiful/ to just keep on
yet he stretch out be and just the two dull word of the couplet into long froggy croak over an f minor chord it_' a weirdly flat foot move at an_important moment
he have a unify band sound now and have let his lead line instrumental player take major_role in it beth galiger on flute bring a hopeful sound to a heavy hearted scene and matt kinsey on electric guitar be miraculous
use echo and delay pedal and a tremolo bar mr. kinsey keep creep in burst like a pink sky and slip away
his work on this record feel_like one continuous performance and one of the best by anyone i have hear this_year
mr. callahan have say that he care about put a kind_of buried story line in his record from song to song
i do_not know about that but there be a single consciousness that hold together dream river
there_' always a force threaten to drag the narrator under in these song an icy road a storm a mate 's deep sleep gravity
his character be confused without admit it and they_'re infantile around love abjectly grateful for its power seek or offer it impulsively
on javelin unlanding he sing do_not die just yet and leave me alone alone alone
on this journey round the sun love be central to the record anyway through all the subterfuge and indirection
this be an album in which a song that ' actually about flying small plane be one level deep about a trust relationship and possibly an even better song about sex
yet the next song spring be explicitly about sex the key couplet be all i_want to do be to make love to you/ in the fertile dirt but point to something else something big and dark
what be it
disappointment decay
we call it spring though thing be die he sing
then he right himself the true spring be in you/ the true spring be in you
when the stock_market prognosticator joseph e. granville talk his subscriber listen
in early 1981 for_instance the dow_jones industrial_average dive 2.4 percent on what be then the heavy trading day in history after mr._granville urge his newsletter follower to sell everything and go short
it rebound in the follow week before tumble more_than 20_percent over the next 15 month
mr._granville who die on_sept. 7 at 90 be perhaps the most_famous of a generation of market seer who make their_own fortune in the less risky venue of the newsletter business in his case the granville market letter which he begin publish in 1963
i_'m pay to put you in at the bottom and take you out at the top he declare as he barnstorm the country with a showman 's flair drum up subscriber at investment seminar choreograph like broadway show
he once slide to the stage on a 100-foot long wire wear his standard after six tuxedo
he use puppet and clown outfit
he often play a blue song on the piano with lyric that underscore his contention that wall_street brokerage be just out to make money off their customer
mr._granville write a daily market letter for e. f. hutton company before strike_out on his_own
at its_peak in the early 1980s his near weekly newsletter have 13,000 subscriber
they pay $ 250 a year and $_500 more for urgent alert by phone and telex as mr._granville seek to time the big gyration in the market
louis r. rukeyser who often have mr._granville on his pbs program wall_street week tell people magazine in 1981 that mr._granville be the most controversial man in american finance
but while mr._granville correctly call a bear market in the late_1970 and the implosion of technology stock in 2000 he miss other major turn like the start of an epic bull run in 1982
and like many other market forecaster his overall performance be very poor compare_with that of basic stock_index fund say mark hulbert editor of the hulbert financial digest which have track the performance of investment advisory newsletter since 1980
mr. hulbert say that from 1980 through january 2005 mr._granville 's stock tip for investor lose 0.5 percent on an annualized basis compare_with an 11.9 percent average yearly gain for a general stock_index
mr._granville 's tip for more aggressive trader lose an average 10_percent a year over that period mr. hulbert say
mr._granville who continue to produce the newsletter until his_death do_not provide enough trading detail after january 2005 to track his performance as precisely
but he get enough of the broad turn in the market right mr. hulbert say that if investor have ignore his stock pick and buy or sell an index fund with each major call they would have earn 8.5 percent a year since 1980
he deserve some credit for insight_into the market mr. hulbert say add that mr._granville create technical indicator still use by many market analyst
he die in a hospice in kansas_city mo. where he be be treat for pneumonia his_wife karen e. granville say
mr._granville revel in all the attention his bold call receive she_say
he love that mrs. granville say in an_interview
it be almost like he be on stage all the time
joseph ensign granville be bear on_aug. 20 1923 in yonkers
in the book of granville reflection of a stock_market prophet publish in 1984 mr._granville recall that his_father have lose $ 30,000 in the stock_market crash of 1929 and at_least twice as much_more that he borrow from grandma buck and auntie blanche
he write that his_family survive only because his relative be comfortable enough to write off their loss and aid us in recover
mr._granville study economics at duke university and graduate in 1948
he also write book on bingo and investing in stamp
he be marry three time
beside his_wife the former karen erickson whom he marry in 1981 he be survive_by six child from his second marriage to the former paulina delp john blanchard leslie leona weissman mary beth and johanna as_well as 15 grandchild and four great_grandchild
an appetite for wonder be only the first_half of richard dawkins 's project two volume memoir about his life in science
with typical unsentimental pragmatism he note_that the companion volume should follow in two_year if i be not carry off by the unpredictable equivalent of a sneeze
no_one will ever accuse this highly opinionated ethologist and evolutionary biologist whose book include the selfish gene and the god delusion of a rosy attitude
this first installment read like the work of a man_who have_already write abundantly about himself
he often tell story that he acknowledge he have tell before
he include the text of speech he have make
and he put particular emphasis_on the evolution yes he would approve of that word of the selfish gene the 1976 genetics book that establish his reputation and put the word meme on the map
with the benefit of hindsight and with a dearth of other compelling material he wonder_if the immortal gene a title suggest to him by a london publisher may have be better_than the one he use
i can_not now remember why i do_not follow his advice he write
i_think i should have do
anyone expect an incisive account of mr._dawkins 's growth as a scientist may be surprised by the meandering path he take here
true his lineage be impressive and his boyhood be uncommonly adventurous so both warrant attention
he take his time explain that his great great great grandparent elope more cleverly than most couple do
henry dawkins and augusta clinton make their getaway in a coach but not before the groom to be have plant half a dozen decoy coach near augusta 's home so that her_father sir henry clinton could_not prevent the marriage
as the british commander in chief in america he could_not win the revolutionary war either
the family history also include clinton george augustus dawkins son of the eloped couple who earn his place in family lore during the austrian bombardment of rebel venice in 1849 when a cannonball hit his bed
a cannonball penetrate the bed cover and pass between his leg but happily do him no more_than superficial damage read the inscription that accompany a cannonball in mr._dawkins 's possession
the story may not be 100_percent true but it do underscore this family 's stay power
mr._dawkins 's forebear have scientific leaning of all kind
since many be post to remote corner of the british empire those leaning be more exotic than most
one cousin write major book about the bird of burma and borneo
other relative hold the post of chief conservator of the forest in india and nepal
another relative be credit with persuade aldous huxley to take mescaline and open the door of perception
as mr._dawkins have_already write in a brief and more obscure memoir for generation sun brown dawkins leg have be stride in khaki short through the jungle of empire
he himself be bear in 1941 in nairobi kenya
grow_up in nyasaland now malawi he lead what sound_like a charm early life
this book include a lovely whimsical painting make by his_mother illustrate the family 's idyllic look african life which include a pet chameleon and a pet bush baby a squirrel size big eyed mammal
mr._dawkins recall his_father 's bedtime story often feature a broncosaurus which say tiddly widdly widdly in a high falsetto voice and read about doctor dolittle whose love of animal make him one of the great fairy_tale naturalist
but the tone turn sharp once this bud atheist be send to a school where the pupil be compel to say a good night prayer
he say this be learn in parrot fashion and evolve_into garbled meaninglessness then add tartly quite an interesting test case in meme theory if_you happen to be interested_in such thing if_you be not and do_not know_what i be talk_about skip to the next paragraph
this be not a book that run on charm
the second_half of an appetite for wonder follow mr._dawkins back to england and into an educational system that he harshly denounce
he write about bully mortifying embarrassment sadistic punishment and an absence of critical thinking which by his light be bad of all
he still bristle at have unimaginatively be call a very inky little boy when force to have an open ink pot on his desk and keep dip a pen into it
mr._dawkins 's memory briefly take him to berkeley calif. where he live long enough to protest american involvement in the vietnam war
they finally arrive_at oxford and to the beginning of his serious career in science
he present detailed description of some of his early experiment in animal behavior like an analysis of newborn chick pecking pattern
then he move on to what appear to be his calling computer science and the creation of computer language
he seek computer base method of analyze hierarchical pattern in nature and the specific of such material like his mutual replaceability cluster analysis program be not for amateur
we_'re a long_way from the sun brown little boy who catch butterfly
mr._dawkins treat the publication of the selfish gene as the divide line between the first and second installment of this memoir
it_' a good place to pause and it suggest strongly that the second volume will be hefty and more focused than this one
mr._dawkins 's memory for his work be much_more vivid than his more personal story
and the work have be far range enough to support autobiographical study
but for now we have the kindling of mr._dawkins 's curiosity the basis for his unconventionality and some very odd glimpse of professorial behavior
mr._dawkins describe one teacher who would begin by say oh dear and
i can_not hold it and i_'m go to lose my temper before warn his student to hide under their desk
and then the ink pot fly
he be a kind gentleman provoke beyond endurance as who would not be in his profession write mr._dawkins himself no stranger to provocation
who would not be in mine
this_week i discover the best new performance space in new_york
it be not in a downtown basement or a convert factory by the gowanus canal
it go by a pretty banal name gallery 634
but when you walk in the door you will know_what i mean
to those familiar with the metropolitan_museum of art 's astonishing reinstallation of its european painting collection 634 be sacred space the display of dutch old master assemble by the department_store magnate benjamin altman
you probably can_not rend it for your next solo recital but on_tuesday evening it be the site of a hearty concert by the early music brass and wind ensemble dark horse consort
the audience take in the program of 16th_century music from the low countries alongside the timeless face hang on the wall both the somber one paint by rembrandt and frans hals 's grin red faced partyers
dark horse 's performance never better_than in its rendition of orlande de lassus 's resplendent justorum animae be not the only occupation of a met gallery on_tuesday
the evening be an occasion for the grand tour perhaps the most perfect realization yet of the mission of met museum presents the institution 's revamp concert and lecture series
that mission be clear tie the met 's musical offering to its exhibition and collection
well the grand tour be nothing if not securely tie
in_addition to the dark horse consort the event bring the vocal ensemble tenet the chamber ensemble quicksilver and the harpsichordist jory vinikour each to a different european gallery to perform 20_minute of music of the period reflect in the painting
ticket holder be divide into four group each on a different rotation through the cycle
mine encounter mr. vinikour first in one of the 18th century french gallery
here too the portrait seem to stop and listen
the blush young lady of fragonard 's love letter turn from her correspondence to hear mr. vinikour 's gallant flexibly phrase account of three movement by louis couperin
couperin 's nephew the great franã§ois be represent by three extraordinary piece the rustic moissonneurs harvester les bergeries the sheepfold a pastoral twinkle its melody immaculate in a thicket of ornament and les barricades mysterieuses the mysterious barricade with a swing almost like pop music
surround_by 16th_century venetian picture by veronese titian and others tenet able_to make soar line uncannily conversational sing madrigal by monteverdi luca marenzio and giaches de wert
the group 's artistic_director the soprano jolle greenleaf provide a luminous start in marenzio 's quando sorge l'aurora and a downward run of crystalline lucidity in monteverdi 's dolcissimo uscignolo
quicksilver include four of the fine early music player in the city the violinist robert mealy and julie andrijeski the harpsichordist avi stein and the theorbo and guitar player charles weaver
the group 's performance amid italian baroque painting feature little hear sonata by dario castello giovanni battista fontana and johann kaspar kerll
these work turn on a dime slow line of ache lyricism tumble into joyous movement
i be face luca giordano 's annunciation as i listen and i would rarely see that same mixture of lyricism and movement more clearly
no drama
that ' how jedediah wheeler the executive_director of peak performances at montclair state_university in new_jersey describe work with liz gerring the on the rise choreographer he have choose to open his fall series on_thursday
without drama be how ms._gerring have describe her_own athletic abstract dance
in both statement the lack be mean as a positive
it have not always be so
ms._gerring 48 have be make dance since the mid-1990 but for the first 10_year she receive almost no recognition
when critic do start pay_attention they write about idea not come to life
disturbingly bloodless be how jennifer dunning characterize ms._gerring 's work in the new_york times in_2006 complain that it be only 42 minute long but 42 minute have seldom pass so slowly
what a change in_2010 when alastair macaulay review ms._gerring 's lichtung/clear as a major achievement and write in the times about watch it with his heart in his mouth
he be not the only critic to sense the opening of a new perspective and the change be not only in the view from the outside
ms._gerring herself feel that lichtung have achieve a clarity miss from her earlier work a communication of emotion and meaning through abstraction
lichtung perform in one of the baryshnikov arts_center 's black box theater attract the notice of mr. wheeler
with its proscenium format and five time the seating capacity of ms._gerring 's usual space the montclair theater offer her the chance to reach a large audience and the challenge of not lose her newfound clarity while scale up
the title of the new work at an hour her long be glacier
part_of mr. wheeler 's strategy for help ms._gerring manage the transition be a two week residency in the theater in_june
during a run_through her commentary be almost reflexively sardonic
she laugh at her dance mock its seriousness
later in the summer talk over coffee she treat her career similarly
moment of drama be immediately undercut by small mildly derisive voice come_out of the side of her mouth
but self deprecation could_not entirely disguise a long struggle
ms._gerring grow_up in sherman oaks calif. a few valley girl locution still cling to her speech and get into dance because she do_not make the gymnastics team
at 13 she start ballet late a devote student never_quite good enough to consider a career
when she be in 11th grade her family move to seattle where she channel unhappiness into modern dance class at the cornish college of the arts
next come four tough year at juilliard
the composition teacher doris rudko encourage her and in dancing work by kazuko hirabayashi she fall in love with abstraction use the technique she excel at without the act that make her uncomfortable
after graduation she be at loose end
her boyfriend be a cyclist so she become one
i spend five_year as this amateur racer she_say stay at super 8s with four of us in the room and do these little race in vermont in the rain
well that be a waste i_think when i finish she add but now she view that period as a stage of unlearn that become useful as she start over as a dancer in a studio by herself develop her_own style
it_' easy to see the link to her athleticism
i be try_to find same sense of push myself physically as i have in cycling she_say
but perhaps the unlearning after a solid dance education be connect to what mr. macaulay would praise in_2011 as her dancer unschooled precision and her newly forge quality
for year ms._gerring 's choreographic career be sporadic with time off for the birth of her three child
her production fall beneath most reviewer radar yet as soon as she begin use body other than her_own she insist upon dancer of first class ability
though her work be now often liken to merce cunningham 's and though she consider him a major influence she have take perhaps one class in cunningham technique
cunningham class though be where she ' find many of her dancer
she also acknowledge the other influence that critic identify that of the postmodernist trisha brown and though ms._gerring never study with her the two become friend
it be ms. brown who help ms._gerring weather that wither review in_2006
that review force me to take responsibility ms._gerring say
i turn a page and start over again but it be all those year that lead to lichtung work out
one continuity between ms._gerring 's early work lichtung and her new glacier be the composer michael_j. schumacher whom she meet at juilliard
she usually choreograph before a score be write often while improvise to other music like pop
yet the dance and the sound in her piece be not_entirely independent there be sync point cue correspondence
we_'re not dance to music she_say but
when it_' not there it_' like we be not able_to dance
the music for glacier come first a composition mr. schumacher build from field recording at glacier lake in colorado
ms._gerring do_not listen_to that score while create but the natural sound be in her mind
the choreography be more gestural than her recent work
i_'m try_to tell my tale a bit she_say
maybe i have the confidence now not to have everyone onstage thrash around
i try_to keep it strip down for as long as i_feel i could
recognize ms._gerring 's attention to delicate relation between dancer the designer robert wierzel have place horizontal panel at the rear of the stage use air and volume to focus attention on the cast
the panel be as blank as movie screen
all the drama be in the dancing

who be roberto bolle
indubitably he be a handsome man an exemplary ballet dancer
in his home country of italy he be a celebrity border on national hero
as a member of american ballet theater he be a reliable lead man and a sterling partner
since 2000 he have also be something of an impresario organize all_star performance under the title roberto bolle and friend
on_tuesday at city center he show one to new_york
the gala evening present as part_of the 2013 year of italian culture in the united_states begin with mr._bolle and the mariinsky ballet 's alina somova in a pas_de deux from excelsior a landmark italian extravaganza originally choreograph by luigi manzotti that have not be see in new_york for a century
perform without scenery as be all but one of the program 's selection the dance seem unremarkable and not especially italian unless the exposure of mr._bolle 's leanly muscle physique count
the duet could have be title gala pas_de deux
there be nine of those on the program follow by two solo
the monotony of format be leaven by a high ratio of choice unfamiliar to new_york balletgoers
and even several of the more familiar item be welcome particularly herman cornejo and luciana paris in twyla tharp 's sinatra suite and mr. cornejo and maria kochetkova in george balanchine 's tchaikovsky pas_de deux
in several way mr. cornejo be mr._bolle 's opposite small explosive
it be a sign of mr._bolle 's mod generosity that he invite mr. cornejo a dancer sure to outshine him in virtuosity and verve
the other man jason reilly of stuttgart ballet and mikhail kaniskin of berlin state ballet be good but less contrastive
another sign and the evening 's great merit be mr._bolle 's inclusion of ballerina rarely or never before see in new_york
elisa carrillo cabrera a mexican bear dancer with berlin state ballet bring a strikingly clean exactitude to uwe scholz 's generic jeunehomme and some psychological complexity to mauro bigonzetti 's kazimir 's color
alicia amatriain a spaniard with stuttgart ballet be a chameleon sweet and lovely in john cranko 's choppy romeo and juliet sexy and dangerous in itzik galili 's vulgar mono lisa
in between in christian spuck 's le grand pas_de deux ms. amatriain reveal herself as a superb comedian a distracted ballerina in glass make dizzy by her fouette turn
in that piece a redeemingly funny sendup of ballet gala duet mr._bolle play the straight man a role to which he be suit
in roland petit 's l'arlesienne opposite the adorable talented young italian ballerina erika gaudenzi mr._bolle 's character fall into a zombielike catatonia
this mr._bolle can do the abandon of the piece 's mad scene be beyond his control
he ' so careful you may almost call him a ballet machine
remarkably that ' what the program 's final work do
through computer graphic massimiliano volpini 's prototype present the manufacture of a ballet dancer
mr._bolle in the flesh
video behind_him point_out the real perfection of his form
the background shift to story ballet scene and multiply video_game replication of the star
be this how mr._bolle view himself
be it a comment on his image
who be this man

when the ambitious refurbishing of the landmark park_avenue armory be complete new_york will have an alternative art center unlike any in the world a national treasure that carefully weave together historical and new design while encompass industrial austerity and belle ãpoque excess
the arduous transformation involve the totality of the armory 's immense celebrated structure which be build from 1877 to 1881 by the seventh national guard regiment the state 's wealthy and most blue blooded it sometimes function a bit as an upper class man 's club
architecturally it be and remain a fabulously hybrid creation
its baronial head house loom over park_avenue between 66th and 67th street behind it lie the soar strip down industrial shed of the wade thompson drill hall
the hall 's 55,000 column free square_foot seem tailor make for oversize work of performance and installation art impossible for any_other institution in the city to accommodate
performance begin mere month after the nonprofit park_avenue conservancy lead by rebecca robertson its president and executive_producer sign a 99-year lease with the state late in_2006 to restore the building and operate it as an art center and have continue nearly uninterrupted throughout the renovation
the armory restoration budget at $_200 million with $ 120 million spend be be lead by the innovative swiss architect jacques herzog and pierre de meuron of herzog de meuron best_know for convert a sprawl london power station into the tate modern
they and their team have be either study or work on the building for seven_year and plan call for a 2018 completion
it be not easy to turn a grand but crumble pile that descend to the world monuments fund 's list of the world 's 100 most endangered structure in 2000 into a fully function cultural entity that also reveal a good bit of its_own physical history
the nature and fruit of the carefully devise renovation process will become much_more apparent on_sept. 29 with the inauguration of the armory 's newly restore board of officers room as an_intimate hall for music and dance recital play and performance art
it be one of the 18 room in the head house and their renovation be especially complicate
commission by either the regiment or its individual company they be do to a fare thee well of gilded age sumptuousness by the lead interior decorator and furniture maker of the day louis comfort tiffany stanford white pottier stymus and the herter brothers
over the decade they be repeatedly redo and update as style change or new technology like electricity arrive
walls be repaint ceiling redecorate new floor lay
paneling be add or change
the current restoration be be oversee by ascan mergenthaler a herzog de meuron partner in concert with the new_york architect charles platt of platt bayard dovell white architects the conservancy staff and an extensive team of restorer and skilled artisan
until_now the improvement have be elaborate yet largely invisible upgrade to the drill hall include air conditioning new window increase electrical power and reinforce structural support
the board of officers room be create by herter brothers among the great design firm of the late-19th century american aesthetic movement
its reopening with a recital by the baritone christian gerhaher accompany on the piano by gerold huber will be something of milestone it will bring the restoration process more fully into public view illuminate a preservation philosophy that accept flaw embrace sign of age and focus more on subtraction than addition all of which must be visible as such
the impose officer room most_recently use primarily as a coat check room have be return to something remarkably close to its original glory but not_quite
it do_not hurt the cause that this chamber be one of the few survive herter interior show the firm 's work at its most original and that it be with the silver room at the far end of the broad first floor hall design by tiffany and restore in the 1980s probably the most_important and stunning interior in the head house
it also have an austerity that fall somewhere between the starkness of the drill hall and the other busy head house room
its wall and ceiling be decorate with different pattern stencil onto solid background an economical imitation of wallpaper use throughout the head house that have be scrupulously clean and repair
its rich mahogany wainscoting pocket door and monumental fireplace relieve of layer of grime and varnish once_again exude a startlingly bright shade of lustrous red
r. mark adams a herter specialist who be in charge of the meticulous restoration of the armory 's mile of woodwork say that the shade may be unique in the herter oeuvre and that it be achieve use mad root
â
the main approach in the head house be a process that mr. herzog and mr._de meuron call delayering

lyon france the buzz around benjamin millepied 's l.a. dance project be undoubtedly fuel by an aura of glamour that emanate from mr._millepied former new_york city_ballet principal future artistic_director of the paris opera ballet seek after choreographer and husband of natalie portman
only one year old the l.a. dance project have_already find international success and on_tuesday night the troupe open the maison de_la danse 's season fill every one of its 1,160 seat
no_one could accuse mr._millepied of coast
as_well as a recent piece of his_own there be premiere from the city_ballet dancer justin peck and by the israeli choreographer emanuel gat
it be a riveting rich evening of dance tightly pack with a range of movement style and influence superbly perform by the small ensemble aaron carr julia eichten charlie hodges morgan lugo nathan makolandra and rachelle rafailedes
mr._peck have make three much praise work for his home company in the last two_year a fourth will have its premiere on_thursday night at city_ballet 's fall gala at_lincoln center
as will a work by mr._millepied
you do_not want_to think_about mr._peck 's travel schedule
murder ballad set to a quirky score of the same name by bryce dessner show what the fuss be about
it be mr._peck 's first piece for a contemporary dance ensemble and he make this immediately explicit as the curtain rise on a stage dot by sneaker
ms. eichten run on first and don her pair quickly follow by five more dancer in casual bright clothes
the mood be insouciant recall jerome robbins ballet like interplay and moves
later there be echo of west_side story in the simultaneously approach and retreat line with which mr._peck end the third section and reminder of robbins 's dance at a gathering in the way social group form occasionally exclude then reabsorb a lone figure
there be other influence too william forsythe in the counterbalanced weighting of the partnering even pina bausch in a cumulatively urgent thrilling series of solo toward the end
but mr._peck 's own voice emerge clearly in his gift for structure and patterning in the dynamic contrast of the movement and in his ability_to surprise both choreographically and psychologically
in the first minute of the piece dancer surround an immobile woman their palm hold up to but not touch her body as a man walk away light darken and a siren wail
murder
a late pas_de deux end with a man drop his prone partner 's hand as the light fade
these moment of drama and inexplicable emotional current be mere hint mr._peck have the great gift of know_how to subtract
mr. gat 's morgan 's last chug be a far_less resolve work but it have its_own gloomy allure a dark european nature set against the bright american vision of mr._peck 's piece
the dance unfold independently in flurry of rapid dislocated gesture against an aural backdrop of recording of purcell 's march from music for the funeral of queen mary glenn gould play bach 's suite franã§aise and jim norton in beckett 's krapp 's last tape
the structure of the work often feel arbitrary but mr. gat 's compositional layerings of body in space their apparently accidental refraction remain in the mind 's eye
so do mr._millepied 's reflection with its eye pop white letter on red backdrop stay and later go by barbara kruger in the artist 's_signature graphic style
on the floor in the same color scheme be write think of you think of me
against this five dancer wear gray tone simple costume perform a series of duet solo and trio to a wide_range piano score minimalist atonal melodic in turn by david lang
the movement be fleet and fluid reminiscent of mr. forsythe 's quintett in the way it both skim the floor yet be weight by gravity
two duet one adagio one allegro for ms. rafailedes and mr. makolandra be full of movement invention and beautifully dance more conventional but perfectly detailed be a sparkle balletic solo for the extraordinary mr. hodges who later move alongside mr. lugo both low to the ground in a duo of catlike stealth
reflection create in may be long 38 minute and can feel slightly desultory at moment
but what_we see hearteningly in this and the other work on the program be man and woman in complex adult encounter
there be no central male female pas_de deux that structural fallback of every neo classical ballet
life these choreographer suggest be more_complicated and interesting than that
when the nine time emmy nominee and widely acknowledge dreamboat jon hamm sail down the red_carpet on_sunday chance be you will notice his date 's dress makeup and hairstyle more_than the particular of his appearance
but mr. hamm will have have his hair carefully style to look loose than the tightly comb businessman 's coif for which he ' know on mad man
i work with jon when he ' jon hamm say his groomer diana schmidtke
i do_not work with don draper
so for me it_' always about make him not look too don draper
almost like he just run his finger through his hair
very natural
though some man famous or not have be boldly step out with guyliner and nail polish we be not_quite at the point where hollywood makeup artist be take credit for it as they do with woman
ms._schmidtke 38 be one of a handful_of male celebrity groomers there a term little hear of 15 year_ago when she_say photographer would ask her what be that like dog grooming but increasingly bandied about in a world of high definition camera and metrosexuality
she have tend_to the floppy forelock and five o'clock shadow of not just mr. hamm but clint eastwood george clooney jimmy fallon viggo mortensen and chris hemsworth make_sure they look_like the best version_of themselves for magazine cover press junket and award show
this_summer ms._schmidtke be in new mexico work on her first film the comedy a million ways to die in the west direct_by and star seth macfarlane whom she start work with two_year ago and groom for the academy awards in_february
review of mr. macfarlane 's oscar host stint be mixed but thanks to the peter thomas roth anti shine gel ms._schmidtke smear on his t zone no_one could say he be shiny
on a typical celebrity booking ms._schmidtke start with an old_fashioned barber shave
next come the eyebrow a potential minefield
the quick way to feminize a man 's face be to over groom the eyebrow she_say
you_can do above the brow but when you start to take too_much underneath or create any type_of arch boom he start to look_like a girl
she prefer pluck the brow to waxing which she_say remove too_much and also use tweezer to tackle stray nose and ear hair
then she apply concealer no pan cake please and mattifying lotion more guy friendly than powder puff she_say as need
in fact ms._schmidtke be sensitive to all sort_of macho preference
for_example she will boil down beauty lingo into action word
pre shave oil may not register with guy but
if_you say it help the glide of the blade ding ding ding they understand_what it mean she_say
within the industry ms._schmidtke be praise as much for her demeanor as for any specific ministration
i always trust that diana will make my client look and feel their best say robin baum a hollywood publicist who have work with mr. hemsworth johnny depp orlando bloom and james franco
she have great energy
the photographer mark seliger who have work with ms._schmidtke for 14 year on shoot for mr. macfarlane will ferrell and others praise ms._schmidtke 's fun and positivity
but the groomer characterize her rapport with a list actor another way
i_'m a little crass at time she_say
ms._schmidtke become interested_in hairdressing after model for nexxus at age 16 attend pivot point beauty school in chicago and move west in 1997 work for a pricey beverly hills salon
i be not use to that type_of clientele she_say
everything be so shiny and new the beautiful people and the car
i fail
but an apprenticeship with marvin lynch then a successful hairstylist lead to representation by the celestine agency she have since move to the wall group which book her on music shoot
i have every intention to do girl hair but it just would not click with actress ms._schmidtke say
in 1999 after an assign groomer do_not show she be pull into a shoot with david boreanaz of angel
in thanks for the favor mr. boreanaz 's publicist next call on ms._schmidtke to groom chris klein for his american pie press tour
then all the mayhem start she_say
i_love it
i be young and my job be make hot guy hotter
she study the history of shaving and stay current by read man 's fashion and groom blog
though ms._schmidtke 's work sometimes involve the more traditional process of put a client into character as she do with mr. clooney for a cary grant style vanity fair shoot she also enjoy watch the application of television trend to real life the boardwalk empire shave close with an undercut while leave a floppy 4 to 5 inch on top be popular this_summer she_say
and while her work revolve_around famous face ms._schmidtke be pleased to see company make more grooming solution for everyday jo
one of her career high point she_say be in_2009 when she make over husband on the oprah winfrey show
but get a man even one who bank on his image to change his regimen be almost always an uphill battle ms._schmidtke say
with guy you have to keep it simple
the new_york city_ballet production of swan lake shape by the company 's artistic_director peter martins in the 1990 be no simple experience
especially as perform on_tuesday it keep tug its audience in different direction
the design by per kirkeby turn it into a pencil cartoon sketch of the swan lake show that ' then be daub by a paint by number beginner class the prince be all blue the villager be green the jester orange and so on
tchaikovsky 's tempo be take at a terrific lick no romantic lingering here
often the music andrews sill conduct the company 's orchestra on_tuesday rush past without deepen the action yet in some central passage we_'re sweep urgently into its vortex
the secondary character be tiresome
queen victoria complain of gladstone as prime_minister
he speak to me as if i be a public meeting here however the queen gwyneth muller on_tuesday in vast mime gesture that suggest she think he be a very public meeting indeed
the jester
daniel ulbricht though a prodigy of speed be completely unfunny
the evil sorcerer von rotbart silas farley who control the enchanted swan maiden and their queen odette be an absurd caricature devil the lining of his cloak the bright fabric of the whole show be hell flame orange
the dancing fall into two main category brisk efficient but flippantly inconsequential or brisk impetuous eloquent and compelling
fortunately sara mearns be rivetingly immediate as both the heroine odette and the look alike antiheroine odile
she dance the role as if live the story for the first_time and as she burn her way through it you_can not take your_eye off her
as each phrase of her music arrive she ' already there on top of it as if it illustrate her rather_than the reverse
in the first lakeside scene the corp of swan maiden dance that way too firm and highly three dimensional
while jared angle as prince siegfried dance in a simple style it_' elegant and full
the carriage of his head the focus of his address to other character the firmness of his phrase all give the drama real seriousness and he ' a superb partner
but when erica pereira brittany pollack and anthony huxley rattle their way nimbly through the step of the act i pas_de trois an over embellish version_of marius petipa 's 1895 st. petersburg version and when megan fairchild tiler peck abi stafford and joaquin de luz prattle through the top speed nonsense of mr._martins 's act ii palace pas_de quatre it_' like hear gilbert sullivan patter song without the humor
only mr. huxley and especially mr._de luz manage to retain elegance the woman be make to look accomplished and silly at the same_time
the waste of the phenomenal ms. peck in this taxing but trifling role be especially disgraceful yet hers be merely the bad case of mr._martins 's fondness for trivialize woman with obstacle course choreography
thus aspect_of the swan lake story be turn inside out
in the traditional version the still part adolescent siegfried rebel against the constriction of grow_up court decorum here mr. angle seem the only reasonable and three dimensional adult onstage until he meet ms. mearns by the lakeside
back in the palace his dreadful mother try_to fob him off with a choice of six uniformly vapid but pushy princess when ms. mearns turn up this time in a black tutu his attraction to her seem entirely a meeting of serious mind amid a gathering of ninny
this really be not the fault of any dancer
city_ballet 's performer on_tuesday make the best case for this problematic production that i have experience their alertness of rhythm be a special pleasure
but most of what they_'re dance be martins choreography which squander them
when the woman of the first court scene extend arm and one leg behind them in arabesque the image have no linear point
then when ms. mearns dance most of her choreography be by petipa lev ivanov and george balanchine the line of each outstretched limb know precisely which star in the firmament it will reach
simply inevitably her dancing show us the full amplitude of ballet and the art form again become something of great consequence
in the palace ballroom it be good to see a few dancer notably the ever improve savannah lowery in the hungarian dance bring real force to their material
as the heartbroken odette in the final scene ms. mearns even reveal value in mr._martins 's choreography
the vulnerability with which she return to fold over swan imagery as if return to her nest and the tragic poignancy with which she invest each phrase be both superb
still mr._martins wreck the start of this scene by give us irrelevant prank by the jester
and in the conclusion odette and siegfried defeat von rotbart without themselves meet death
but then odette still withdraw forever from siegfried because he break his vow to her
perhaps balanchine may have bring this off but he would have do so with a pierce image of dance drama
the astounding end of his divertimento from le baiser de_la fee'â come to mind
mr._martins instead revert to mere romantic ballet formula with the corp screen odette 's exit and bar siegfried 's effort to pursue her
that be not this production 's only lame episode
the palace scene feature a foolish dance to the start of this ballet 's mazurka while siegfried plot his betrothal to the wrong heroine odile then clumsily the score cut to the last section of tchaikovsky 's action music
be it just stubbornness that make mr._martins keep revive his swan lake without try_to improve its more obviously weak patch
he know well how balanchine go on rework ballet
and mr._martins 's dogged persistence in make no change to flawed production keep his whole company in a state of perpetually interrupt development

mr._quinto who study act at carnegie mellon talk_about develop the character of tom williams 's give name

mr._quinto start with a biography by lyle leverich tom the unknown tennessee_williams concentrate_on the family dynamic depict in the play among the age mother and her two adult unmarried child
there be no shortage of work about the life of tennessee or work by tennessee or both he say with a laugh and a slight eye roll

i do_not think it ever fully resolve for him
i_feel much_more resolve in my_own life

gothenburg sweden last_month i lay in bed in sweden with my computer tune to the inaugural championship game of the national women_'s soccer league
it be 2 a.m. and through sleepy eye i watch the starting lineup walk_out in sahlen 's stadium in rochester
i could_not help but reminisce about my last professional game in the united_states play in that same stadium the 2011 championship game of women_'s professional soccer
as the portland thorns celebrate the championship i watch on the screen from a different place literally across the world in europe and mentally than when i celebrate on that field in_2011 with the western new_york flash
since_then i have play for three different club one in russia a w league team in new_jersey and now for kopparbergs/goteborg in sweden
all of a sudden the new american_league seem foreign to me
as an outside observer the coverage of the n.w.s.l. have be excellent
the game have all be available for me to follow although i have only catch a handful because of the time difference
as much as i do know about the league i have realize there be a_lot of area in which i be out of the loop
many of the player i know well and have play with over the year but there be also some unfamiliar face
since i play in the u.s. there be also two new franchise the thorns and the seattle reign
play in w.p.s. be my first professional experience so i do_not have much with which to compare
now as a slightly more experienced professional my observation of the n.w.s.l. be influence by my feel for european woman 's soccer and how the game be grow globally in_addition to in the u.s.
in sweden while there be fantastic support for the woman 's game there be a different emphasis_on marketing and attendance
damallsvenskan the swedish woman 's league game have much small turnout than the number i be see in n.w.s.l. game report but for the most part the team here do_not rely_on ticket sale as a source of income
most club have a number of local and corporate sponsor who support the team regardless
hence the extreme number of logo on most swedish team uniform sometimes include one on the posterior of the short
i be hop to watch the n.w.s.l. sustain itself and flourish over the come year
play in europe have open my eye to how the plan need to be long_term
team in sweden and in europe have gradually develop a culture style and system of play
it_' something i really appreciate about play abroad and hope to see take_place in the u.s.
in sweden there be a promotion relegation system with a second league champions_league spot to aim for and the swedish cup
every team have something to fight for regardless of its standing in the 12-team first division
this have take time to evolve but i would love to see professional woman 's soccer in the u.s. reach that point down the road
see the photo of the portland thorns celebrate their title take me back to 2011 but also take me forward in time with hope that the league will_continue to provide playing opportunity for american canadian and mexican player and also begin to expand to attract player from elsewhere in the world
it be an impressive league with wonderful talent and dedicate fan
with my add perspective from play in europe i_realize how_much n.w.s.l. be truly in its infancy
as americans we always look to quickly make thing big better and more successful
like most invest follower and participant i_think there should be some tweak make to the n.w.s.l. to continue to improve from season to season
after play elsewhere however and see that even the league with great history and parity be not perfect i have come to the conclusion that the n.w.s.l. 's opening season be a success

only recently do the brother settle out of court
it_' be a long road say jonathan stuart the young brother in an_interview
the value of the three painting be next to nothing when they be produce in the late 1940 and early 50 but mr. stuart now call them precious heirloom so precious in fact_that he and his_brother simply could no_longer afford the insurance and upkeep

q.
there_' a dining alcove off the kitchen in my one_bedroom apartment
should i turn it into a second bedroom
a."when someone can see that the dining_area can become a second bedroom it_' a plus for resale say mady faber an associate real_estate broker with town residential in manhattan
for a grow family or a couple be_able to buy a one_bedroom that can be convert to a two_bedroom mean they can stay there for many more year if_they have a baby or need to work at home
the mere potential for this kind_of conversion she add will generally make the apartment worth more money than a straight one_bedroom that can_not be convert
and move ahead with the conversion before list the property can make the home even more appealing
just make_sure you really do have enough space she_say because aesthetically if the living_room be small and you cut_off the dining_area to create a second bedroom it may_seem cramped
and that could turn_off potential buyer
the kitchen should also have a separate entrance that be not through the new bedroom so the flow of space do_not feel awkward
there be several other basic requirement the space must meet to be consider a true second bedroom say james ramsey owner of the new_york design firm raad.
the first be adequate light and air he say mean the space need a window
and there_' a minimum dimension of eight foot that you need for the width of your bedroom he say
in his soho apartment mr. ramsey recently transform a dining nook into a bedroom for his year old_son
it_' basically a room that ' calculate to be the minimum size you need for a twin size bed a crib and a set of dresser that you_can change the baby on top of he say
mr. ramsey suggest_that anyone consider this should first reverse engineer the room base_on the furniture that will go in it to avoid a post construction surprise
if your space meet the minimum requirement a second bedroom can often be create with the addition of a single new wall
a permanent wall be one option mr. ramsey note but a pressurized wall a temporary partition that be not permanently fasten to structural member so it can be more easily remove in the future would also work
either way he recommend a pocket door rather_than a swing door because it_' a space saver
and for a more elegant solution mr. ramsey suggest instal slide partition or glass door on track so the room can be open wide when not in use
that ' obviously a great expense he say
but it give you more light and the illusion of more space."â question_about repair or redecorate before put a home on the market may be send to marketready@nytimes.com
unpublished question can_not be answer individually
in many bathroom the tub seem_like an afterthought a soulless scoop of white enameled cast_iron or acrylic
stephan jaklitsch think that ' a missed opportunity
a more interesting tub he say could make your bathroom feel a little more special and like a real retreat
mr. jaklitsch 45 be a principal of jaklitsch/gardner architects in new_york with a number of international project include several marc jacobs store
when he travel abroad on business he often choose his hotel base_on the bathtub
i_'ve be travel to place like japan norway and london he say where it_' not unusual to find tub design with long deep soaking session in mind
especially in cold wet climate there_' a history of culture use heated water to heat themselves
for a similarly appealing bathtub at home he suggest unexpected material like lightweight concrete wood zinc copper and carve stone
and if_you want it to make a sculptural statement he say consider a free stand tub rather_than a build in model
even_though new_york apartment be very small he say there_' this whole trend toward free stand bathtub
at af new_york in the flatiron district mr. jaklitsch admire the ofuro larch wood soak tub by rapsel
i do like a wood tub because it echo the japanese onsen soak experience he say refer_to the country_'s hot spring
the wood be seal for easy maintenance he say and will feel soft and a little_bit warm than many other tub
he also like the spoon xl by agape make from a material call cristalplant in a large egglike form
it have a very comfortable backrest he say
and even better it can accommodate two people
for a tub with a more traditional look he point_out the kallista for town tub by michael s. smith at ann sacks
it_' a classic new_york tub he say inspect the beefy rounded rim
i could see it in a historic town_house
and the 20-inch depth he_add be a luxury
at simon 's hardware and bath he find a boxy tub call cube from wetstyle
it would work free stand or in an alcove he say in a space challenge bathroom or against a wall of glass
so what kind_of tub do mr. jaklitsch choose for the bathroom in his west_village home
i have a 1930s cast_iron tub that ' extra long that come with the apartment he say
i renovate the bathroom but keep the tub."â

paris face grow fear of hypersexual young girl the french upper house of parliament vote wednesday to end beauty pageant for those young than 16
the senate pass the new ban 197-to-146 as an amendment to a large bill aim_at increase gender equality
the measure now go to the low house the national assembly for discussion and a vote
pageant be popular in small_town across france though far_less frequent and less intense than in the united_states
and france have no equivalent of american reality show like toddlers tiaras and its spinoff
here come honey boo boo that feature very young contestant
still the intense focus_on beauty here combine with a surge of image of sexualize prepubescent girl have raise fear that the pageant could take on the over the top quality of american contest
it be extremely destructive for a girl between the age of 6 and 12 to hear her_mother say that what ' important for her be to be beautiful chantal jouanno the ban 's champion say wednesday
we be fight to say what count be what they have in their brain
ms. jouanno a former junior minister for environment and a senator represent paris from the center right party u.d.i. write a report on the hypersexualization of child in_2011
the report be commission by the health minister in response to public outrage over a photo display in paris vogue that feature under age girl in sexy clothes and posture with high heel makeup and paint fingernail
the episode draw attention to the increase use of very young girl in fashion photography and advertisement
france have a number of contest that parent can enroll their child in online
two mini miss and graines de miss miss in the making have annual beauty pageant of more_than 20 contestant age 6 to 13 in various city
the french pageant do have some sense of restraint
some prohibit bathing suit competition and advertise the contest with photo of little_girl dress up more like fairy_tale princess than as youthful femmes fatales
the 2011 winner of mini miss oceane scharre appear in a white gown but with her crown askew and little obvious makeup
however her long sparkle earring seem rather too large for the slender little_girl
opponent protest that the penalty be too severe up to two_year in prison and a $ 40,000 fine for anyone_who help encourage or tolerate child 's participation in the contest
some pageant organizer say they be frustrate by the suggestion that they be corrupt girl
maud chevalier who start graines de miss in 2001 bar young candidate from wear heel over 1.4 inch high short dress wig makeup and swimsuit
i_want to organize a contest which respect the child mrs. chevalier say in an_interview
she_say the ban show how misinformed people be about beauty contest
they look_at beauty contest on tv and in the u.s. where contest be not adapt to child she_say
they think that child parade on a stage to look_like a barbie
her_own interpretation be quite different
children fight_against stage fright by wear a princess dress she_say
in our contest she also say girl be princess for a day they make friend with others

the recent agreement_between the united_states and russia on syria_'s chemical_weapon make_clear what should have be obvious long_ago president_obama 's effort to uphold international norm against weapon of mass_destruction in the middle_east will entangle the united_states in a diplomatic and strategic maze that be about much_more than syria_'s chemical_arsenal
president_bashar al_assad of syria insist_that the purpose of his chemical_arsenal be always to deter israel 's nuclear_weapon
if syria actually disarm what about egypt and israel
egypt about whose chemical_weapon the united_states have be strangely silent point to israel
and israel of course have its_own chemical_weapon to deter syria_'s and egypt 's and it be not about to give them up
a headline in the israeli daily haaretz a few_day ago state israel adamant it wo_not ratify chemical arm treaty before hostile neighbor
these three country have not adhere to the biological weapons convention either
and israel be not a member of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty despite have develop a formidable nuclear arsenal of its_own which will_soon become the central fact in this drama whether the united_states like it or not
an obstacle of america_'s own making have long prevent comprehensive negotiation over weapon of mass_destruction in the middle_east
while the world endlessly discuss iran_'s nuclear capability and the likelihood that it will succeed in develop an atomic arsenal hardly anyone in the united_states ever mention israel 's nuclear_weapon
mr._obama like his_predecessor pretend that he do_not know anything about them
this taboo impede discussion within washington and internationally
it have keep america from press egypt and syria to ratify the chemical and biological weapon convention
do so would have bring immediate objection about american acceptance of israel 's nuclear_weapon
what sustain this pretense be the myth that america be lock into cover up israeli nuclear bomb because of a 1969 agreement_between president richard_m. nixon and israel 's prime_minister golda meir
for mr. nixon it be mainly about gain israeli support in the cold_war
he and mrs. meir understand the need to discourage the soviets from provide their arab allies with nuclear_weapon
a declare israeli nuclear arsenal would have lead to pressure for moscow to do so
but such cold_war reason for america to stay mum evaporate decade_ago
everyone know the israelis have nuclear bomb
today the main effect of the ambiguity be to prevent serious regional arm control negotiation
all other country in the region be member of the nonproliferation treaty but there be still unresolved issue
syria be catch build an illicit nuclear reactor in 2007 which israel swiftly bomb
mr._assad still have not allow international inspector to fully investigate that obliterated reactor site
and syria_'s ally iran be suspect of try_to assemble its_own weapon program to challenge israel 's nuclear monopoly
indeed many_analyst believe_that mr._obama 's decision to issue a red_line bar the use of chemical_weapon in syria be in fact drive by the perceive need to demonstrate that he be prepared to use force against iran if it move further toward nuclear_weapon
this witch brew be suppose_to become the subject of an international conference mandate in_2010 by the unanimous vote of the member of the nonproliferation treaty include the united_states
but that conference have not happen in part_because of white_house ambivalence about how it may affect israel
in_april the american assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation thomas m. countryman express hope that the conference would be hold by this fall
and earlier_this month russia 's foreign_minister sergey_v. lavrov urge all party to set a conference date as quickly as possible
he also argue_that it should include israel and iran
russia attempt_to include the conference in last_week 's agreement but secretary of state_john kerry resist
it be not go to go away
if washington want negotiation over weapon of mass_destruction in the middle_east to work or even just to avoid make america appear ridiculous mr._obama should begin by be candid
he can_not expect the country participate_in a conference to take america seriously if the white_house continue to pretend that we do_not know whether israel have nuclear_weapon or for that matter whether egypt and israel have chemical or biological one
and if israel 's policy on the subject be so frozen that it be unable_to come clean mr._obama must let the united_states government be honest about israel 's arsenal and act on those fact for both america_'s good and israel 's

neal schwartz a san_francisco architect be eager_to share what he have learn about how to get the look for less
want a sleek minimalist kitchen
he recommend put in a glass backsplash and instal open shelving instead of upper cabinet
if_you 're consider a poured concrete floor he suggest add a small amount what amount to few penny worth of a pigment know as lampblack to make it a chic dark gray instead of use expensive color concrete
and as an architect he be always look for way to enhance a home 's sense of expansiveness
you_can use all the thing on hand that be free the light the view to add value to whatever financial resource you bring he say
mr._schwartz who teach at the california college of the arts and own a firm call schwartz and architecture be use to counsel anxious city dweller try_to squeeze more room out of small house
but after watch several client get in a knot over whether to go with prefabricated or custom construction he design a house of his_own to prove a point that custom design do_not have to cost much_more and it have all the advantage that come from a bespoke fit
i just want_to push back against the idea that prefab be the only way to get good design at a good price he say and that custom mean fancy
mr._schwartz envision the low slung two_bedroom two bath structure which he call hydeaway house as a weekend retreat for himself his spouse ron flynn and their two spinone italianos florence and aldo
but with the idea that he and mr. flynn would eventually retire there they be both 51 he also design it with handicapped accessibility in mind
the total cost of the 2,000-square foot home be $ 720,000 or $ 360 a square_foot
that ' not cheap but neither be high quality prefabricated construction which can cost nearly as much per square_foot
and high end residential construction in the area be even costly typically about_$ 450 a square_foot not include cost like permit and engineering and design fee
the big strategy to save money be to create a really efficient floor plan that put the space where it_' go to be feel the most mr._schwartz say
i see so_many home where space just seem to be waste
accordingly the l shape layout he create with the kitchen and living area in the center and identical bedroom suite on either end wrap around one corner of the site maximize open space on the one acre lot and block out view of the neighbor
from the outside the house be unassuming clothe in inexpensive cedar side
but pass through the front_door be like open a clothbound book and see full color illustration inside
expanse of glass which mr._schwartz do_not stint on take in the view endless line of grapevine frame by gnarled california valley oak
and visual trick like exterior wall of glass in the shower and window precisely position to look onto particular view help foster the impression of endless space
to furnish the house mr._schwartz seek out piece that would be interesting and durable but at a comfortable price
i start at room board to figure_out what i_want because_they have pretty nice stuff he say
and then look for how to get it some other way
the coffee table he make from slice of white cypress with caster so they could be easily move
the light fixture in the living_room be base_on d.i.y. plan supply by lindsey adelman the brooklyn lighting designer and make with inexpensive part from the hardware store
and in an effort to get some art up quickly mr._schwartz take an x acto knife to a book of bird photograph by andrew zuckerman
the bathroom sconce from schoolhouse electric be tricky
i have a few false start mr._schwartz say
i_'d open the box and ron would say what be you thinking?'â he_add a little ruefully i be try_to save money
those_who remember donny osmond singing you be my sunshine on the andy williams show in 1963 have probably become so inured to life 's little curve ball that they wo_not be surprised to learn that the popular entertainer now 55 and a grandfather several_time over be about to release a housewares collection with his_wife debbie
everyone_else take a moment to compose yourself
donny osmond home will kick_off in_january with 1,000 item include furniture light rug bedding dinnerware bath accessory and home improvement tool
some of the good will be available through online retailer later this_year a list will be post on donnyosmond.com start on_sept. 24
mr. osmond discuss his new business from las_vegas where he and his sister marie have be perform a long run nightclub act at the flamingo hotel
this interview be edit and condense
q. last_month you blogged about a recent operation
how be you
a. i know that would be the first question
it_' a real bummer let_'s put it that way
as marie say on stage i break my butt
i tear the tendon from the gluteus medius muscle right off the bone as i be dance but i finish the show in that condition
i imagine you have find housewares easy on the muscle but still i wonder_what make you veer into design
this be something that be more organic than one would imagine
for 35_year now debbie and i have be marry and she '_always create this wonderful atmosphere at home for me because my world as you_can imagine be crazy with the touring and travel
now that we_'re get old it_' something she and i can do for the rest of our life together
because you_know the term family be pretty synonymous with the term osmond
how would you describe the collection
i_wish debbie be on the phone too
there_' go to be i be lean these different type_of phraseology because it_' such a new business to me but it_' more of a transitional style if that make any sense
it_' kind_of eclectic with a kind_of a modern flair
the same_way as i have handle my career for 50 year you have to learn to adapt and change
we_'re tell by our marketing team that honeycomb and the color gray be trend right_now so debbie and i these last couple of day have sit with our design team through the computer
we approve certain style and it_' perfectly in line with what she and i like
i catch glimpse of your utah home in an_interview you do some year_ago with kathie lee gifford
it seem comfortable and traditional
would you say that sum up the style of donny osmond home
keep in mind that ' the only time we have ever open up our home for an_interview and probably the last
we maintain that our home be very private even_though we_'re open up our style
i_think a very comfortable very homey atmosphere be a nice guideline
but there may be something a little more elegant or a little more transitional
it really depend_on the taste of the buyer
have partner for many decade with your sister what be it like to work with your wife
be this your first partnership
yes it_' the first
no
for 35_year she ' be my partner
what do each of you bring to the table
i bring the support
she ' get the eye for this
what ' really interesting over the year our taste have actually become one
i remember when we first get marry in 1978 i be more modern and she be more traditional
but in 1978 the style be so different so you_'re constantly evolve
that ' what_we want_to bring to the public all different kind_of thing available at different price
a_lot of people can_afford these_thing
each phase in your career have bring a different relationship to your audience
who do you hope to connect to with this collection
fantastic question
let_me tell you a story i look out at the audience every night in vegas
right after i win dance with the stars there be a little 10-year old kid who have watch every week
he be dress in this suit and he have a tie on and he be with his mom and dad
he be watch me intently through the entire show
afterward we do a meet and greet
i_saw this little kid in line and the closer he get the more excited he get
he come_up and shake my hand
he say
mr. osmond i do_not know you could sing too
here ' another little story
last_year i have a meeting over at one of the hotel here in vegas
as i be come_up to give them my car in the parking structure i hear the song i do for the disney movie mulan
i follow the sound and come to a van and all_these u.c.l.a. student be in there half asleep because_they be up all night either gambling or partying
they be on their way back to l.a. i knock on the window and the driver roll down the window and turn the music down
he say can i help you
i say that song you_'re listen_to
that ' me
he say be you donny osmond
this be our theme song when we have test and exam
it start out let_'s get down to business
so now i have get fan that be 10-year old college student parent and grandparent
so here ' the answer to your question
i do_not know
how do you appeal to that wide a demographic
you have get to be eclectic
you have get to be broad base
you_'re probably short on time but i have another story
do please tell it
last night at the meet and greet this lady come_up to me and she_say my 5-year old_daughter listen_to you all the time
i say oh that ' so sweet
she_say she keep ask for anaconda anaconda
and we finally realize she be ask for and they call it puppy love
now i have get a 5-year old fan
what be your home like grow_up
which hotel would you really like to refer_to
i be always on the road
but seriously my home when we do come home from a tour be a big spanish house in san fernando valley calif.
it be not elegant it be not a mansion
we do_not drive fancy car
that ' one thing my_father and mother teach us live within your mean
if_you have mean do_not flaunt it
in your book life be just what you make it you say that at a low career point you think of toss it all in and start a home security business
why home security
yeah it be 1988 and just before soldier of love hit in 1989 and i have try so hard to get back out on the chart and could_not do it even with peter gabriel 's help
the reason i like home security be because i be always interested_in electronics
i do_not think it have anything to do with my_own security
i be just an electronics geek
i have pretty_much lose everything in the early 1980 and i have to rebuild
in 1988 i have three child and i_think how be i go to support a family
that be an alternative and thank goodness it do_not go that way
if_you could relive any decade of your life which would it be
well i have get to be honest
the 70s be amazing even through the purple sock and the puppy love
yeah i enjoy it
but i_wish i enjoy it a little_bit more
i be read a great book call the power of now
i be learn_how to enjoy the moment
but i have to be honest i be enjoy this moment more_than any in my_life because i really do_not have to prove anything anymore
i be never go to be in coast mode
i be always go to be climb some kind_of mountain
but it_' such an enjoyable time in my_life with my wife and kid and grandbabies
and we_'re try_to open up that joy we have have in our home and make it accessible to other people

mendocino county calif. twenty year after they embark_on an experiment in communal living the member of cheesecake gather for an anniversary celebration over labor day weekend
nearly 100 people the seven who_live here full_time six who be here part time and assorted child grandchild and friend include laura hartman one of the architect who design the complex spend two day barbecue talk hike through the redwood and compete to see who could bake the best cheesecake
the competition be in honor of the community 's name which be derive_from a loose translation of casada the surname of the family who own the 20-acre property at the turn of the 19th_century
the young and more adventurous among_them sleep in tent or tepee in the meadow ms. hartman bring her_own pup tent while old visitor bunk together in the residential building or stay in hotel nearby
it be a fittingly multigenerational celebration for an idea inspire_by the parent of some of the original member who become increasingly isolated with age no_one should have to grow old alone
in 1994 the new_york times report on how those member or partner as they call themselves have settle into their first year of life as a community retirement
for 11 friend it_' off to camp
it be one of a number of such experiment know as cohousing community that be spring up around the country at the time base_on a danish model develop in the 1960
the original group of 11 include four married couple and three woman all in their 50 and 60 each of whom agree to pay a monthly fee for the mortgage tax and insurance on the 6,000-square foot complex as_well as a small daily usage charge for utility whenever they be in residence food and phone bill be handle individually
bedroom and some bathroom be private but nearly everything_else be share an arrangement that seem feasible give the longstanding friendship of most of the member who have start a cooperative nursery school for their child when they live in southern_california in the 1960
still there be three building in the complex two that contain common area and private apartment and one where resident could pursue their hobby because as ms. hartman say in the 1994 article everyone under one roof make people nervous
how do the experiment turn_out
on the 20th anniversary the consensus be generally positive
as helen papke 84 observe it have be a lesson in patience
when it_' good it_' so good she_say
and when it_' bad it_' so bad the angst and argument we have with each_other
but we have a conviction to work it out and we will
dick browning 78 whose wife louise die in 2007 be more effusive
i_love it he say
i_love the community
of the original 11 member seven be still here although apart_from ms. browning no_one have die
one couple and one woman leave for personal reason
the community have take on new member so there be now 13 altogether
no_one seem lonely but some of the resident be not_quite as energetic as they once be
take daniel myers a retire lawyer who move in with his_wife jill in 1993 when he be 60
now he say i can_not get on the roof to get the leaf off and i can_not chop wood
and needless to say there have be plenty_of compromise along the way
even something as simple as cut down a tree or buy a new dishwasher require a consensus or at_least the agreement of three quarter of the resident
and get that many_people to agree on anything can take a while
ask sophie otis a clinical psychologist who be now 77 who have to lobby for almost two_decade to get_rid of the tree obstruct the view from her window
in 1993 when she move in it be only six foot_tall and she could see around it
ten year_later at 30 foot it be start to block the light
but it be not until january when it be 45 foot_tall and threaten to fall down that the community agree to remove it ms. otis say
they finally cut it down this_year not because of my problem with the view she_say but because it be block the light and be a hazard in lot_of way

in some respect 1988 have the feel of an alien distant era
there be no such thing as the world wide web then
the soviet_union be still around the berlin wall still stand
americans elect a republican president who would raise tax to help tame the budget deficit
on_tuesday however the census_bureau remind me how for most americans 1988 still look a_lot like yesterday last_year the typical household make $ 51,017 roughly the same as the typical household make a quarter of a century ago
the statistic be staggering hardly what one would expect from one of the rich and most technologically advanced nation on the planet
i have write several_time before about how measure of social and economic well_being in the united_states have slip compare to other advanced country
but it be even more poignant to recognize that in many way america have be stand still for a full generation
it make me wonder_what happen to progress
consider 36 year_ago this_month when nasa launch the voyager_1 probe into space 11.6 percent of americans be officially consider poor
the other day voyager sail clear out of the solar_system into interstellar space the first man make object to do so record its environment on an 8-track deck
use the same official metric which actually undercounts the poor compare to new method use by the census today the poverty_rate be 15_percent
to be sure we have make progress over the last 25_year
the nation_'s gross_domestic product per person have increase 40_percent since 1988
we have gain four_year worth of life expectancy at birth
the infant mortality rate have plummet by 50_percent
more woman and more man be enter and graduate_from college
we also have access_to far_more sophisticated consumer good from the iphone to car pack with digital device
and the cost of many basic staple notably food have fall significantly
carl shapiro an_economist at the university of california berkeley and an expert on technology and innovation who step_down from president_obama 's council on economic advisors last_year call the progress in information technology and biotechnology over the last 25_year breathtaking
most americans partake in the benefit offer by these new technology from smartphones to better dental care professor shapiro say
still he acknowledge somehow this impressive progress have not translate_into great economic security for the american middle_class
in key respect in fact the standard of living of most americans have fall decidedly behind
just take the cost of medical service
health_care spend per person adjust for inflation have roughly double since 1988 to about_$ 8,500 push up health_insurance premium and eat into worker wage
the cost of go to college have be rise faster than inflation as_well
about two third of people with bachelor 's degree rely_on loan to get through college up from 45_percent two_decade ago
average student debt in_2011 be $ 23,300
in contrast to people in other developed nation who have devote more time to leisure as they have get rich americans work about as much as they do a quarter_century ago
despite all this toil the net worth of the typical american family in the middle of the income distribution fall to $ 66,000 in_2010 6 percent less_than in 1989 after inflation
though the bursting of the housing bubble and ensue great recession take a big share of the blame for family weakening finance it be nonetheless startle that a single financial event only a hiccup on the road to prosperity of americans on the top of the pile could erase a generation worth of progress for those in the middle
though the statistic may be startle the story they tell be unfortunately not surprising
it be the story of america_'s new_normal
in the new_normal the share of the nation_'s income channel to corporate profit be high than at any time since the 1920s while worker share languishes at its low since 1965
in the new_normal the real wage of worker on the factory_floor be low than they be in the early 70
and the rich 10_percent of americans get over half of the income america produce
almost all of the benefit of growth since the trough of the great recession have be go to those in the upper class say timothy smeeding who head the institute for research on poverty at the university of madison wisconsin
middle- and low_income family be get a small slice of a small economic pie as labor_market have change drastically during our recovery
this story be about three_decade old
in_2010 the department of commerce publish a study about what it would take for different type_of family to achieve the aspiration of the middle_class which it define as a house a car or two in the garage a vacation now and then decent health_care and enough saving to retire and contribute to the child 's college education
it conclude_that the middle_class have become a much_more exclusive club
even two earner family make almost $ 81,000 in 2008 substantially more_than the family median of about_$ 60,000 report by the census would have a much tough time acquire the attribute of the middle_class than in 1990
the income of these type_of family actually rise by a fifth between 1990 and 2008 accord_to the report
they be more educate and work more hour on average and have child at a late age
still that be no match for the 56 percent jump in the cost of housing the 155 percent leap in out of pocket spending on health_care and the double_digit increase in the cost of college
so either we define the middle_class down a couple of notch or we acknowledge_that the middle_class be not in the middle anymore

rio de janeiro brazil_'s high court on_wednesday allow a new round of appeal in a trial over a vast vote buy scheme a decision that may allow senior political figure in the rule workers party to maneuver out of hard jail time for their action in what may be brazil_'s big corruption scandal
end month of suspense after defendant be find_guilty and sentence to prison by the same court in november 2012 in what have be celebrate then as a watershed moment the justice rule by 6 5 to reopen crucial aspect_of the trial
so_far no_one have go to prison in the scandal which emerge in 2005
the move set a troubling precedent by raise_concern over a domino effect in many other corruption case involve powerful figure say ivar hartmann a professor of law at fundaã§ã£o getãºlio vargas a top brazilian university
even before the trial it be remarkably rare for politician in brazil to go to prison after be find_guilty of crime like corruption kidnapping and employ slave labor partly_because of the special judicial standing enjoy by about 700 political figure include senior cabinet minister and all 594 member of congress
this standing require their case to be hear only in the high court which be already bogged down by thousand_of other case each year
the system produce year of delay in judge politician charge with serious crime
legal expert say such case could now drag on indefinitely after a ruling by the high court justice on_wednesday which allow appeal of their_own vote in these trial
the televise debate_over the appeal within the court the supreme federal tribunal produce heated moment in recent_week
justice gilmar mendes say the court be invite mockery as a juvenile tribunal of irresponsible people while another justice ricardo lewandowski argue_that the court be merely give defendant the right to a new appeal
give the delay that have_already characterize the trial the court 's discussion of the appeal could realistically drag on for year helenita acioli the interim prosecutor general say this_month
that may benefit figure like jose dirceu de oliveira e silva who be chief of staff for brazil_'s former_president luiz inã¡cio lula da silva and sentence to nearly 11 year in prison for his role in orchestrate the vote buy scheme call the mensalã£o or big monthly allowance after the regular payment make to legislator in exchange for their vote

the appeal which be think to have originate in the 16th_century legal system of portugal brazil_'s former colonial ruler be abolish there in the 1930
few brazilians have even hear of the appeal until the high court consider them in the mensalã£o trial
while few conviction be expect to be overturn defendant be seek less stringent prison condition include arrangement that allow convict to leave prison during the day to work
some legal expert hold open the possibility that some defendant could avoid jail time altogether if the trial endure long crime commit about a decade_ago could be exceed by the statute of limitation
the stain on their reputation remain say matthew m. taylor a scholar at american university in washington who specialize_in brazil_'s legal system
he say the late twist in their trial be more troubling for what it say about brazil_'s court and their inability to effectively and expeditiously tackle widespread corruption within the political system
it use to be that if_you could_not afford to pay a big medical bill your doctor or hospital may let you pay it over time a little_bit each month
the holston medical group for_instance a large multispecialty physician group in tennessee have one plan with such low payment that it would have take the patient 115 year to pay a bill off
but the day of such informal arrangement may be number
you_can still find installment plan but now they be often more structured agreement manage by a company hire to oversee your account
hospital say they be turn to such business because as insurance plan shift more cost to patient provider be stuck try_to collect money they be owe
hospital provide about_$ 41 billion in uncompensated care in_2011 accord_to the american hospital association
some hospital have even come under fire for heavy handed practice like put representative of collection agency in emergency_room to get patient to pay up front
enter service like carepayment and clearbalance which promote no interest payment plan to hospital and patient as flexible and patient friendly
hospital be very sensitive to the fact_that out of pocket cost for patient be increase drastically say craig froude chief_executive of carepayment
they_'re try_to figure_out how to adapt
detail vary depend_on the term negotiate between the hospital and the payment company
in some case hospital offer the plan as an option
other hospital automatically enroll patient who do_not pay a bill within 90 day
typically the company offer plan of as long as two_year and sometimes as long as five_year with no interest or fee for patient
payment be usually base_on a percentage of the total bill with minimum around $_25 a month
the hospital pay a fee to the company in exchange for get its payment up front
the company then collect the payment
some offer automatic deduction and let patient check their account online
the benefit be that hospital may get more of the money they be owe than they would otherwise even after factor in fee to the outside company
the patient get time to pay a big bill and avoid the damage to a credit record that would occur if the debt be send to collection
that can still happen
if the patient do_not pay the company send the account back to the hospital for review
a patient who use such a plan may receive a card bear the name of the hospital and the payment firm but it be not a credit_card
the company say they may conduct a soft inquiry on a patient 's credit report which do_not affect the credit score
a patient whose score fall below a certain level will still be put on a plan but the company will not pay the hospital until the patient have make a few payment on time
a patient 's payment record generally be not report to credit bureau
mitch patridge chief_executive of csi financial services which be base in san_diego and offer clearbalance say it give patient the option of have their payment history report to credit bureau if_they choose to help build credit
jeff costello chief_financial officer at beacon health system in south bend ind. say it have try offer short_term payment plan and even low interest loan through a local bank but patient do_not like pay interest for medical bill
the system begin use carepayment 's no interest plan in_2009 and it have be well receive by patient he say some who use it once ask for it up front when seek additional care
patient can add new bill to the account he say and have their monthly_payment recalculate
here be question to ask about medical installment plan â
will i have to pay interest if i do_not pay off the bill by a certain date
some provider include dentist and eye care outlet offer true credit_card financing
they may offer zero percent rate but the rate can skyrocket if_you be late or stop pay
hospital say their plan be different and offer no or in some case very low interest
but make_sure you understand the detail of any plan you accept and get a copy of the agreement in writing so you_know what_happen if_you can_not pay
â
can i still get financial assistance if i agree to a payment plan
you should always ask first about financial help to reduce your overall bill say mark rukavina a specialist on medical debt
under the affordable_care act nonprofit hospital will have to develop write policy on their charity care and collection practice
many for profit hospital have write policy too
you should ask
â should i use a no interest plan even_if i can pay in full
some provider offer significant discount if_you pay in full within 30 day
if_you can do so that may be a better option

business be more and more worried that their energy cost will put them at a disadvantage to competitor in nation with low energy cost and some energy intensive industry have begin to shun the country because_they fear steep cost ahead

the chancellor 's about face not only seize the energy initiative from her center left opponent it also amount to a gamble that could prove to be her most lasting domestic legacy or a debacle whose consequence will be feel for generation
the cost of the plan be expect to be about_$ 735 billion accord_to government estimate and may eventually surpass even that of the euro_zone bailouts that have receive far_more attention during ms._merkel 's_tenure

for this rendition of stand in the schoolhouse door there be no national guard troop or presidential edict
but on_wednesday several_hundred university of alabama student and faculty_member invoke gov. george wallace 's 1963 attempt_to block the enrollment of black student here as they demand an end to segregation in the university 's fraternity and sorority
together the mostly white group march within sight of the president 's mansion one of the only structure on the campus date to before the civil_war
tracey gholston a black_woman who be pursue a doctorate in american literature at alabama say mr. wallace 's legacy continue to permeate the university which have nearly 35,000 student about 12 percent of them black and 45_percent from out of state
it show a thread
it_' not just something that be resolve 50 year_ago say ms. gholston who have a master 's degree from the university
you_can not say we_'re integrate
we_'re fine
we_'re not fine
the demonstration come one week after the campus newspaper the crimson white publish the account of a member of the university 's alpha gamma delta chapter
the student melanie gotz say the sorority have bow to alumnae influence and consider race when it evaluate potential new member earlier_this year
other sorority member share similar story
racial bias in alabama 's greek system which have a membership of nearly one quarter of the university 's undergraduate enrollment have be an open secret for decade
it be not an issue unique to alabama and it be complicate by an era in which black and white on many campus often gravitate to fraternity and sorority that be segregated in practice although many national greek organization say they have ban discrimination
still many feel systemic discrimination have be tolerate at alabama and ms. gotz 's public revelation lead to widespread demand for reform
university official repeatedly have say the responsibility for membership standard rest with the sorority and fraternity which be private group
but on_sunday night the university 's president judy l. bonner summon adviser of traditionally white sorority and tell them she be order an_extended admission process
and in a videotape statement release on_tuesday she acknowledge_that the university 's greek system remain segregated which student and professor describe as a historic admission
but the demonstration which dr. bonner greet when it arrive_at the rose administration building focus_on a sweeping demand for the president and her lieutenant do_not stop restructure the campus
we be hold the administration accountable and hop that they hold us accountable as_well to improve it in a sustained way and not just in a band aid approach say khortlan patterson a sophomore
this be a great success today but it_' just one step in the process
ms. patterson who have consider join one of the campus 's predominantly black sorority have plenty_of allies
protester at the 7:15 a.m. rally include dozen of blue shirted member of the mallet assembly a residential program found in 1961 with a history of urge social change at alabama
the only black president of alabama 's student government elect in 1976 be a member of the organization
since dr. bonner 's order those sorority have open hurried effort to bring black_woman into their rank by extend bid to an unknown number of minority student
it remain_unclear whether any of those woman will accept the offer
the university 's fraternity system found in 1847 also remain largely segregated and people here say they would like to see alabama broaden its diversity initiative to include those organization one of which draw attention in_2009 for stag a parade with its member dress in confederate uniform
most greek organization have bar their member from speak to reporter but sam creden a demonstrator who be also a member of delta sigma phi say there be some unease about the ferment
a_lot of my fraternity brother be actually worried that this will be support sort_of forced integration say mr. creden a junior from chicago
those_who march he say be hop for a deep systemic change
we do_not want this to be the facade of integration mr. creden say
we_want people to truly accept people of all background and race
caroline bechtel a member of phi mu say greeks be largely relieve by the event of recent day
the conversation have be happen but there_' be no real action say ms. bechtel a junior
finally it feel_like something may change and i_think that be refresh
we do_not have to be scar anymore to want a better community
philadelphia in_august 2005 my_son alec then 39 year old collapse into unconsciousness while walk his dog in the suburb of philadelphia
by the time he arrive_at the hospital his heart rate have slow to 30 beat per minute
fortunately an experienced physician recognize that alec be have a cardiac complication of lyme infection
installation of a pacemaker and an infusion of antibiotic save his life
each year there be more_than 30,000 case of lyme_disease report to the centers for disease control and prevention
but last_month the c.d.c. announce that the real number of annual infection be close to 300,000
alec have one of the most serious consequence of a lyme infection but the microbe can also lead to neurological illness like meningitis and encephalitis and more commonly fatigue arthritis and rash
but the symptom can be hard to spot
indeed day_before he become gravely ill alec consult a physician because of a rash but because it do_not appear in a bull' eye shape lyme_disease be not suspect
it be a common misconception that the lyme_disease rash always appear this way
the tick that carry lyme_disease which be prevalent in the northeast united_states the upper midwest and northern california as_well as in central europe and scandinavia can be hard to spot too
both nymph and adult tick can transmit the bacteria but the tiny nymph which emerge in the springtime be hard to see with the naked eye until they mature in the fall
in other_word it_' easy to be bite and not realize it
if_you be infect it_' easy for a doctor to miss the symptom
should not there be a vaccine for such a prevalent and dangerous disease
in fact we use to have one and be perfectly capable of produce another if the public demand be high and we avoid the mistake of the past
in 1998 smithkline beecham now glaxosmithkline develop a vaccine that be about 80_percent effective for at_least a year after three dos
but the advisory committee on immunization practices which counsel the c.d.c. on vaccine use be lukewarm about the real benefit and necessity of it
the committee make a weak recommendation to consider vaccination for high risk person overlook the fact_that plenty_of casual gardener and hiker be be infect
instead the committee emphasize the use of protective clothing and insect repellent despite little evidence_that those measure prevent tick bite and even less evidence_that people will constantly use them
nevertheless the vaccine be put on the market and physician have to decide what to do with the ambiguous recommendation
then the manufacturer make a strategic error of its_own decide to directly advertise the vaccination to the public despite the fact_that by and large people rely_on their doctor recommendation to decide_whether to receive a vaccine
in_addition the manufacturer put the vaccine on the market before it have be test in child so it could be prescribe only to adult
but the big blow to the marketing campaign come from a group of volunteer who have be involve in the vaccine 's prelicensure study and who report develop arthritic symptom after the vaccination
although the rate of arthritis in the vaccinated volunteer be the same as the rate in the control group some lyme_disease activist conclude_that the vaccine cause rather_than prevent lyme_disease
in 1999 a class action suit be bring against the manufacturer
retrospective study have show no connection_between the vaccination and arthritis but at the time sale of the vaccine drop precipitously and in 2002 the manufacturer withdraw it from the market
of course lyme_disease do_not go away
the tick that carry the lyme bacteria be spread to new area
and though early antibiotic treatment can kill the lyme bacteria the diagnosis be frequently miss at the beginning of the disease as in my_son 's case
we_need to prevent people from get lyme_disease in the first place
the experience of glaxo have unfortunately frightened other company away_from pursue this need vaccine
i be a consultant to most of the major vaccine manufacturer though i have no financial interest in the development of a lyme vaccine and i have long be argue for a return to this area
despite the manufacturer reluctance scientific study have continue and experimental vaccine against lyme infection be available for further development
if manufacturer think there be a market for them they will work to obtain a license from the food and drug administration but first they must be convince that the fiasco of the first vaccine will not be repeat
physician and patient should write to the c.d.c. to remind them of high public demand
it be likely that a new vaccine would now be recommend for all those_who work or play outdoors in the area_where lyme bearing tick be common a large_part of the population of the united_states
until then americans can vaccinate their dog against lyme_disease but have no such option for themselves
stanley a. plotkin be a professor of pediatrics at the university of pennsylvania
the dreadful monotony and morbidity of the gun_control discussion in this country have leave me dispirited
another mass_shooting
another round of shock sadness and outrage
another pitch discussion about right and responsibility mental_illness and background_check
and then nothing
the pundit debate merit
the public demand action
but in the end n.r.a. intimidation pressure the coward in congress to maintain the status_quo and scare ordinary citizen into believe_that they face extraordinary threat from the burglar out to steal property to a government out to rob them of their gun and the second amendment
as president_obama tell telemundo i do get concerned that this become a ritual that we go_through every three four month where we have these horrific mass_shooting and yet we_'re not willing_to take some basic action that we know could make a difference
but it have become a ritual and we or at_least too_many of our congressman and congresswoman be too afraid to act
we be stuck in a cycle of savagery as one shooter after another catch us in his sight
one reason we talk past one another on gun be that we_'re talk from vastly different worldviews
accord_to a march report by the pew research center gun_owner be more_likely to be man than woman old rather_than young white rather_than black or hispanic live in the midwest and south live in rural or suburban area and be marry
in many way this gun ownership division reflect the ideological split in our politics
another_reason be that n.r.a. and gun lobby scare tactic have be depressingly effective
they raise the dander of one issue voter to dazzle effect and that leave politician grovel at their foot
so rational discussion get lose in the weed of extreme rhetoric
this be not an all or nothing battle
but we_must approach the issue and the fact with an open mind
and we have to start with one point the vast_majority of gun_owner be responsible law abide citizen
they own gun for protection hunting sport or even as collector
if most of these people be not responsible there would be far_more mass_shooting than there be now
the problem rather be that there be simply too_many gun in this country to ever ensure_that some portion will not fall into the hand of the criminally inclined or the violently insane
gun proliferation be a chicken that have come home to roost
accord_to the geneva base small arms survey there be an_estimate 270 million civilian firearm in this country in_2011
the country with the second high number of weapon 46 million be india which have nearly four time the population of america
a november 2012 congressional research service report put the estimate even high at approximately 310 million firearm available to citizen
that ' almost one gun to every man woman and child in this country
that lead to this idea of gun as protection the idea that because criminal already have gun law abide citizen need to have them too just to even the play field or dare i say kill field
accord_to that march pew report protection have replace hunting as the no 1 reason that people own gun
the notion that the world be more dangerous than it use to be and you_can be keep safe only with more gun be a linchpin of the n.r.a. argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry
as the n.r.a. 's executive_vice president wayne lapierre put it the only thing that stop a bad guy with a gun be a good guy with a gun
the only problem be that the fact do_not neatly line up with that line of reasoning
a june report_from the institute of medicine and the national research council entitle priorities for research to reduce the threat of firearm related violence have some intriguing but not conclusive finding
accord_to the report there be about 300,000 violent crime involve firearm in 2008
however the estimated range of defensive us of firearm range_from 108,000 to more_than three million
furthermore the report point_out that study of the effectiveness of the defensive use of gun have find consistently low injury rate among gun use crime victim compare_with victim who use other self protective strategy
however the study hasten to add 1_2 next_page

mr._rouhani prepare_for a trip to new_york next_week for the annual gathering of the united_nations keep up the dizzying pace on_wednesday in an_interview with nbc news in which he declare that iran would never seek weapon of mass_destruction include nuclear_weapon and that he have full power and complete authority to make a nuclear deal_with the west
there be plenty_of skepticism in the west over the new tone emanate from tehran and iran veteran have see previous thaw in the diplomatic climate disappear seemingly overnight
mr._obama have speak of test mr._rouhani 's seriousness
but iran expert cite the apparent end to iran_'s ideological taboo against direct talk with the united_states as_well as the apparent concurrence of the supreme_leader say that this new moderation seem different
tehran 's turnaround be all the more startling in view of the eight often bizarre year of mr._rouhani 's holocaust deny predecessor mahmoud_ahmadinejad who relish every opportunity to ruffle the feather of western leader
but mr. ahmadinejad 's bellicose nationalism drive iran into a diplomatic isolation that leave it with venezuela and syria for allies and saddle it with debilitating economic sanction over its_nuclear program analyst_say
those sanction have more_than halve iran_'s oil sale from 2.4 million barrel a day in_2011 to less_than 1 million now and inflation have spike the currency the rial have fall by half
it be the danger of fall even deep into this economic abyss possibly threaten their hold on power that prompt iran_'s leader to mend tie not only with the west but with their_own people_who desperately want more personal freedom analyst_say
we be now at a unique moment in the islamic republic 's history say farshad ghorbanpour a political_analyst close to mr._rouhani
economic reason be now justify political reason to talk to the u.s.
the current moment differ significantly from an earlier reform period under president mohammad khatami when the rule on public behavior and freedom of expression be relaxed
but in contrast to the current situation mr. khatami never have the serious backing of the iranian political establishment
our supreme_leader mr. khamenei have give the green light that mean there will be no group try_to sabotage potential talk like in the past mr. ghorbanpour say
when he arrive in new_york next_week one expert say mr._rouhani will be bring along a package of proposal on iran_'s nuclear_program which tehran say be for peaceful purpose but the west believe be a cover for develop weapon
i_think he will be_able to discuss iran put a cap on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuge the conversion of the stockpile of uranium enrich up to 20_percent into harmless fuel plate or dilute it down to 3 5_percent say mohammad ali shabani a political_analyst base in tehran who hold moderate view
there could also be talk of iran accept more inspection by at some point ratify an additional protocol to the united_nations nuclear nonproliferation treaty mr. shabani say
the german newsmagazine der spiegel report that mr._rouhani may also be ready to close down fordo iran_'s highly secure mountain bunker which be believe to be safe from any israeli attack
but mr. shabani say this would not happen
this site be iran_'s insurance card in case of a military attack he say
i highly doubt iran would close that down
mr._rouhani have also indicate_that he prefer to negotiate over the nuclear case with the west on the high political level possible and there be even talk of a meeting next_week with mr._obama an event that would have be all but inconceivable only week_ago
jay carney the white_house press secretary say wednesday that there be no plan for mr._obama to meet with mr._rouhani when both leader be at the united_nations early next_week
but he say the president be eager_to see whether the issue of iran_'s nuclear_program could be resolve
as we have long say the window of opportunity for resolve this diplomatically be open but it will not remain open indefinitely mr. carney say 1_2 next_page

san_francisco beaten again james spithill the hard drive skipper for oracle_team usa stand on his team 's catamaran wednesday with rough water and the bay bridge for a backdrop and answer_question through a headset
it_' not over it_' a long_way from over spithill say
that seem much close to bravado than to reality with emirates team new_zealand need only one more victory to dispossess oracle of the america_'s cup and with race 12 just about to begin
but there be other force at work in san_francisco bay beyond crew work and technology worthy of nearby silicon valley
there be the wind_limit put in place in the wake of the sailor andrew simpson 's accidental death in may.
those wind_limit cancel both scheduled race tuesday then force the second race to be postpone wednesday with the big yacht already joust for position and head for the starting line
no the america_'s cup be still not over even_though it now seem only a matter of when not if the kiwis will finish off spithill and his multinational crew and their billionaire owner larry ellison
wednesday 's postponement come after team new_zealand have win the day 's first race by 15 second to take an 8 1 lead in the cup
the hundred_of new zealanders gather on shore at america_'s cup park and perhaps as many as a million more watch back home on morning television be poise for a celebration that have be a decade in the making for the nation of 4.4 million
now the kiwis must wait until at_least thursday when two more race be schedule either of which could be the final race
we can_not sit back and try_to play it safe say ray davies team new_zealand 's tactician
we_'ve get to sail every race as best we can and push the boat really really hard
you really notice it
as soon as you back off a little_bit on these boat and try_to go a bit conservative your lead can get chop down really quick
davy and the kiwis balance risk and reward quite nicely in wednesday 's first race take_advantage of their favor port entry in the strong ebb tide that have complicate this_week 's racing and also make the wind_limit even low
team new_zealand have the lead at the starting line and then with the two boat overlap use its right of way to force oracle to drop speed
it then sail away with a clear lead that be three second at the first mark
but these ac72 capable of hydro foiling and hitting speed well over 40 knot be remarkably close in performance at this stage and oracle remain in close touch on the downwind leg
team new_zealand 's lead be only six second at the second_round mark and oracle even take the lead briefly on the upwind leg that follow
but the kiwis control the top of that leg beautifully
a mediocre tack from oracle contribute to significant separation and a 17-second lead at the third mark
the gap grow big until oracle sail alone and close to the boundary of the course begin to make serious gain downwind
but davy and his team be think big picture try_to avoid extra jibe that could have slow their_own progress
spithill and the two olympic gold medalist in his afterguard tom slingsby and ben ainslie could never conjure a way to get back in front as the kiwis respond with just a hint of desperation hold them off and round with an 18-second lead before close out their late hard fought victory
to have in the first generation of the class two boat that be this close in performance over a wide variety of condition be quite unbelievable say dean barker team new_zealand 's understated skipper
i_think both team have react very well to what they have observe of the other team and i_think the boat have just come together in term of performance
but though the race have become tight and compelling the gap in the standing keep increase
team new_zealand have win eight race to oracle 's three but because of a two race penalty impose on oracle for cheat before the cup match begin the official score be 8 1
look we have get a hell of a battle on our hand here but strange thing have happen in sport spithill say
i_'ve witness some pretty big comeback there be no precedent for a comeback of this magnitude in the america_'s cup which date to 1851
and the prospect of lose the cup hardly seem to have san franciscans up in arm clamor for more speed from oracle_team usa a team that have only one american in its start crew of 11
i_'d love to see the kiwis the little underdog that tiny little country that have more sheep than people take down larry ellison say mike altman a 35-year old american from san_francisco who be follow the racing from america_'s cup park on_wednesday
altman add larry ' get a big ego and you_know i_feel like he ' not_necessarily the most well like business leader around the area
he have not make a_lot of friend
he ' know as pretty brash
a_lot of people see this as his_own personal party his_own little ego trip and it_' not something that i_think a_lot of people be clamor for to have an america_'s cup here
now it be likely_to soon be go possibly never to return
in 162 year of the cup only eight site have stag the race
one of them be auckland new_zealand in 2000 and 2003
no_matter what spithill say into his headset a return visit look imminent

the federal_reserve do the right thing when it decide on_wednesday not to begin reduce the monthly multibillion dollar bond_purchase that be a pillar of its effort to spur the economy
to do otherwise would have violate the fed_'s own criterion for gradually withdraw the support measure
the fed have say that any easing would be premise on substantial improvement in the labor_market

the fed have also be look for a sizable increase in economic_growth but that have not materialize and be unlikely to give various headwind include the prospect of another round of damaging budget fight in washington
the decision to stay the course be also important because it indicate_that the fed be give due consideration to both_side of its dual mandate to foster both price stability and full employment
the bond_buy program which be intend_to bolster the economy by keep long_term borrowing rate low be not without peril
but its big danger rise inflation be nowhere in evidence
that mean that the potential stimulative benefit of the bond_purchase still outweigh the potential downside
that do_not mean that the program be an ideal or even particularly effective way to combat persistent economic weakness
the economy 's problem a weak labor_market stagnant wage insufficient consumer demand widen income inequality intractable poverty be not primarily the fed_'s to solve
rather they require direct government policy to create job raise wage spur demand increase tax on the wealthy and expand the safety net
these however be congress 's responsibility thwart largely by republicans who have oppose policy that would help the economy and thus reflect well on president_obama while promote automatic budget_cut and other policy that can only slow the recovery

the decision mean that a government_shutdown next_month be now much_more likely
in the past shutdown threat be avert because republican_leader be willing_to negotiate on spending issue though the spending_cut that result be often harmful to important program

as a strategy the house plan make little sense

assume 60 vote can be find to beat back the inevitable filibuster from republicans like mike lee or ted cruz the senate will almost_certainly approve the resolution minus the defunding language send the bill right back to the house

beirut lebanon an extremist group link to al_qaeda rout syrian_rebel fighter and seize control of a gateway town near syria_'s northern border with turkey on_wednesday post sniper on rooftop erect checkpoint and impose a curfew on the local population
the takeover of the town azaz by fighter from the islamic state in iraq and syria or isis reflect the rise strength of extremist fighter in northern and eastern syria and their rapidly deteriorate relation with more mainline rebel
by early thursday islamist rebel leader have intervene to stop the fighting although most of the town appear firmly in the hand of the extremist opposition activist say
the extremist have not seize the nearby bab al salameh border crossing with turkey
azaz sit just south of the border crossing on the road to aleppo syria_'s large city and have serve_as an_important artery for the rebellion in northern syria allow arm fighter and supply to move in and refugee flee the violence to leave the country
its seizure be likely_to alarm syria_'s neighbor
turkey which have vocally support the fight_against force loyal to president_bashar al_assad and allow fighter and arm to flow freely across its southern border now face a bold qaeda affiliate

the takeover also signal a new low in relation between the rebel fight a civil_war against mr._assad 's force and international jihadist who have flock to rebel control area to lay the groundwork for an islamic state
for much of the 30-month old conflict the rebel welcome jihadist fighter for the know_how and battlefield prowess they bring to the anti assad struggle

if mets pitcher matt harvey have tommy_john surgery on his right elbow it will be pay for partly with worker_compensation insurance
a partly tear ulnar collateral ligament like harvey 's be consider a workplace injury just as if he be a truck driver hurt on a loading dock
the basic agreement_between major_league owner and player require that team pay the cost of injury
the employer get to recover as an offset any worker_compensation recovery that be available say rob manfred an executive_vice president of major_league baseball
and the club be on the hook for what worker_compensation do_not pay
at some point after an operation or procedure a player sign a form that allow his team to pursue the insurance claim
so if worker_compensation do_not pay the full cost of derek jeter 's surgery for a fractured left ankle last_year the yankees make up the difference essentially the cost of do business
the player never see a bill manfred say
another factor be that the cost of tommy_john surgery be not uniform
dr. james andrews the renowned orthopedic surgeon may charge more_than the hospital for special surgery where the mets medical director david altchek be an orthopedic surgeon
andrews prescribe a six- to eight week rehabilitation program for harvey earlier_this week that would precede any decision to operate
altchek perform tommy_john surgery on one of harvey 's teammate jeremy hefner
reimbursement for a surgeon 's service and hospital cost vary widely base_on state fee schedule say john burton a worker_compensation expert and professor emeritus at the school of management and labor relations at rutgers
a_lot of state be get into fee schedule that would limit the amount_of reimbursement that a practitioner or hospital would receive he say
some state like new_jersey do_not have a fee schedule but it_' one of the few
one baseball team executive who be not authorize to speak publicly cite recent case of insurance company reimbursement for the cost of tommy_john surgery include the fee for the surgeon the anesthesia and the operating room time
in one instance the insurer pay $ 13,087 on a $ 25,075 claim
in another example the insurer pay $ 10,255 on a $ 38,076 claim
frederick m. azar an orthopedic surgeon at campbell clinic in memphis say a small local survey by his staff discover a surgeon 's fee for tommy_john surgery to be nearly $ 2,900 while hospital or surgical center cost range_from $ 13,000 to $ 16,000
still more money would have to be spend on rehabilitation which be easy for a professional or college athlete
a_lot of athlete involve in rehab have team trainer which be a build in cost say azar the team physician for the memphis grizzlies
baseball have a single worker_compensation policy through a major insurer that be for all the employee of its team not just the player
coverage with private plan like baseball 's be different from the more commonplace worker_compensation insurance which be available through state but be finance by employer
for baseball whose team once handle their_own insurance in this area the centralized industrywide policy that it have have for about a decade have save team ten of million of dollar in premium
manfred say team pay the premium base_on the size of their payroll their injury experience and the generosity of the benefit of the state in which you operate

zaatari refugee camp jordan those americans who count themselves as war weary should meet fawzia a middle aged woman who make perhaps the most difficult decision any parent can
fawzia be among the refugee straggle across the syria jordan border here
she have just arrive on a dangerous weeklong journey from ghouta syria a damascus suburb where nerve ga kill hundred on aug 21
but for fawzia chemical_weapon be secondary
the real weapon of mass_destruction in syria be the ak-47s rocket missile and bomb
an agreement broker by the world 's power that be limited to chemical_weapon while useful seem a bit irrelevant to the atrocity that define the life of most syrians
no_one in fawzia 's family be hurt in the chemical_weapon attack but then there be a ferocious conventional shelling of her neighborhood
her family_member scatter in terror and mustafa her 8-year old_son disappear
no_one know_what happen to him
fawzia decide to flee with two child to jordan in hope of save them possibly sacrifice mustafa
she be rack by guilt
the united_nations refugee agency which run this zaatari camp be accustom to tragedy
an aid worker gently tell her how to register mustafa 's name in case he turn up somewhere
talk to syrians like fawzia it seem bizarre and narcissistic that in washington there be talk of whether the syrian crisis have be resolve
maybe the politician crisis there have be ease but the humanitarian catastrophe here just get bad
indeed in the last couple of week president_bashar al_assad seem to have step up the pace of bombing shell and other conventional attack on civilian area
fawzia say she would like to see american missile strike on her country in hope that an assault would degrade the syrian army 's capacity for mass murder and shorten the war
that seem by far the most_common view among refugee here although it_' not universal
some worry_about civilian casualty or think a strike would be too little too late
whatever one think of a military_strike to destroy some of assad 's murderous air_force i be in favor but have very little company in america we_should find common ground in insist_that international negotiation address not only chemical stockpile but also humanitarian access in syria
that would mean demand that the syrian_government and rebel alike allow aid worker and food and medical assistance across their line
it_' not impossible that both_side would agree under pressure and that may ease some of the bad suffering within syria
valerie amos the united_nations humanitarian chief tell_me that nearly seven million syrians will need aid to survive
humanitarian access could save some of those life and also reduce the hemorrhage of refugee
the united_nations estimate that every 17 second another syrian flee the country place almost unbearable strain on lebanon and jordan in particular
jordan have be remarkably welcome to syrian refugee but public resentment have apparently lead the government to tighten the arrival spigot recently and many ten of thousand_of displace syrians be now reportedly stick on the syrian side of the border
one third of syrians be now displace
on an american scale that would be equivalent to 100_million americans have flee their home
this refugee camp zaatari be already one of the big city in jordan and the refugee be tough to manage
a few_month ago they begin dismantle a trailer that function as a police station
within hour there be nothing leave they have steal an entire police station
many refugee tell_me that everyone in their neighborhood would relocate to jordan if it be not so dangerous to travel
fareeda al hassan a woman from the city of hama have just cross from syria with a gaggle of child when i meet her
she explain that government bombing have destroy her home and she have see pro government militia behead child so she pay a guide to smuggle them on a 10-day journey that bypass government checkpoint
if soldier think traveler be head for jordan they sometimes execute them as presumptive traitor
during the family 's journey a machine gun post open fire on their convoy
the two vehicle in front of theirs a bus and a private car burst into flame and everyone in them be kill hassan say
guide ferry syrians to jordan sometimes give small child sleep pill so that they wo_not cry from hunger and draw an attack from syrian troop
we may not be_able to solve syria_'s problem
i be not even certain that we can mitigate them
but we can try and a starting point would be a big push for humanitarian access
maybe that would even allow aid worker to find mustafa and reunite him with his guilt ridden mother

but now his political future have become murky while mr._hynes say on the record that he be not run as a republican three people close to him be say that he be indeed consider it
on primary night when he suffer a 10-point loss to his challenger kenneth p. thompson mr._hynes say that he would not continue to campaign for a seventh term
yet republican_leader be urge him to try again in part_because they believe_that have mr._hynes campaign as a republican could draw voter to joseph_j. lhota the party 's nominee for mayor
and mr._hynes have not_quite shut the door on that possibility
though mr._hynes tell mr._thompson he be ready to start the transition process his top adviser have be explore a republican run ask others with experience in brooklyn politics whether he would stand a chance say city_councilman lewis a. fidler an old friend of mr._hynes
mr. fidler say that he have not speak to mr._hynes who be on vacation but that those close to the district_attorney be take the conversation very seriously
but mr. fidler a democrat say he would not advise mr._hynes to run in a borough where democrats outnumber republicans by more_than 800,000
i_think in the end a certain realism be go to set in he say
another person close to mr._hynes say the district_attorney have back away_from his resolution not to run as others include state_senator martin j. golden who be a republican and mr._lhota 's adviser urge him to reconsider
reach by phone mr._hynes say that nothing have change since the primary
i say after i lose the primary that i would not actively seek re_election on the republican or conservative line he say
i_'m give you a very clear definitive answer
yet when ask_if he would tell republican_leader not to campaign on his behalf he say i_'m the nominee of two legitimate party and i will remain as the nominee through the general_election
for me to do_anything else would be disrespectful of the leadership who give_me the nomination in the first place
mr._hynes 's campaign manager dennis quirk do_not rule out a run say no decision would be make until mr._hynes return next_week
mr. quirk say the impetus for mr._hynes to run be come from republicans not the district_attorney
he really can_not tell the republican_party not to campaign mr. quirk say
as for mr._hynes 's chance he say it_' a far stretch but it could happen
mr._hynes have be a democrat for all of his nearly 24 year as district_attorney but he secure place on the republican and conservative party ballot line this_year
mr. golden and other republicans have tell_him he could win with a coalition of republicans and democrats who do_not vote in the primary but may support him
mr. golden note_that primary turnout be low with about 22 percent of democrats vote
mr. golden say there be another_reason republicans want mr._hynes to campaign
it help joe lhota who will need substantial support from democrats to win mr. golden say
i_think they would be a good team

the challenge be to find a way to make that resource accessible to a wide variety of people mean the elderly disabled and family but that do_not damage the resource itself
it_' a balancing act
you have to respect both objective
the question come down to whether the adirondack park agency which govern land use in the park should designate the land as wilderness which prohibit the use of motorize vehicle or wild forest which allow them
the nature conservancy have remain neutral but several other environmental_group include protect the adirondacks the adirondack council and the adirondack mountain club be press for a wilderness designation
the land be part_of a much large acquisition in 2007 by the nature conservancy which purchase 161,000 acre from a local timber company
the $ 110 million deal which include 90 mountain peak and 300 lake and pond be hail as a milestone in the history of adirondack park a remote patchwork of private and public land in upstate new_york
after meet with local official and resident the nature conservancy decide to preserve 92,000 acre as active timberland through sustainable logging a move that use the state purchase of development right to save both job and the land 's open character
the group also win a commitment from the state to buy 65,000 acre in installment over five_year and add them to the forest preserve which be off limit to development and logging
this first section to be buy by the state be break up into a few parcel
the debate center mainly on the large of them a 17,320-acre area know as the essex chain of lake tract a network of lake and pond in essex county as_well as a 925-acre stretch of land along the indian river
there be several different proposal for those two parcel allow vary level of motorize access
another 2,780 acre that include the waterfall call ok slip falls would be classify as wilderness under each alternative
in a study of the 200 large lake in the adirondacks protect the adirondacks determine that only a dozen be off limit to motorboat and float plane
half of those be difficult to access require long hike through wood
the group be lobby for alternative 1a which it call wilderness with access allow visitor of all ability_to park their car within a short hike of the essex lake chain
we have great mountain that be wilderness and incredible stretch of forest that be wild say peter bauer executive_director of protect the adirondacks
but we do_not have that many big lake where people can get a wilderness experience that be timeless
but for other resident and elect official whose town encompass the recently acquire land motorize access be see as critical to revitalize the adirondacks beleaguered economy
make those connection be essential to build economic opportunity say sue montgomery corey supervisor of the town of minerva which include part_of both the essex chain of lake tract and indian river tract
we would like to be_able to snowmobile ride or hike to the other community ms. corey say at a public hearing hold by the adirondack park agency
hike in three mile carry a canoe from an access point will not work for most senior or most young family
the agency receive nearly 4,000 write comment that lean four to one in favor of wilderness protection while spoken testimony tilt slightly in favor of wild forest
later this_year the agency will submit a recommendation to gov._andrew m._cuomo
in the meantime the state 's department of environmental conservation have weigh in with its_own preference alternative 4b
wild forest but with a special management area that would provide flexibility to limit motor use
in a phone_interview mr. martens say that the special management area could for_instance give the state leeway to restrict motorboat to those with quiet electric engine and allow more motorized access during the less busy shoulder season of spring and fall
for the nature conservancy however the significance of add ten of thousand_of acre to the forest preserve transcend the battle over noise versus silence paddle versus propeller
it_' a point that get forget in the classification debate say michelle brown a conservation scientist for the group 's adirondack chapter
this land will never be develop or harvest for timber
it_' forever wild
dr. stephen malawista an infectious disease researcher who orchestrate the detective work that in the mid-1970 lead to the discovery of lyme_disease die on_wednesday at his home in hamden conn.
he be 79
the cause be metastatic melanoma his_wife tobe say
lyme_disease begin with the transmission of bacteria through the bite of a black legged tick and can spread to muscle joint the heart and even the brain
last_month the centers for disease control and prevention say lyme_disease be diagnose in 300,000 americans each year
many scientist contribute to today 's understanding_of lyme_disease
but a team lead by dr._malawista as chief of rheumatology at the yale school of medicine and allen c. steere then a postdoctoral student be widely credit with define the ailment
their work be recognize in 1985 with the ciba geigy ilar rheumatology prize a prestigious honor in arthritis research
in present the award dr. george e. ehrlich a vice_president at ciba geigy the pharmaceutical giant hail the achievement as a truly magnificent piece of medical detective work
there be few example in modern time of a single team accomplish so_much in such an elegant way dr. ehrlich say
the story begin in fall 1975 when two mother one from lyme conn. the other from adjacent old lyme be distress by the odd rash neurological symptom and swollen joint that their family and others be experience
unable_to find answer and frustrated each approach yale independently
the initial diagnosis be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis but that disease have never be know to appear in bunch
doctor at yale count 51 case a rate about 100 time what would have be expect to occur in a combined population of 12,000 in the town of lyme old lyme and east haddam
the case have also occur almost exclusively in warm weather month
here be a disease that by its clustering it be cluster in time it be cluster in space it be cluster in family and on road it really look_like there be a vector something that transmit the disease such as an insect dr._malawista be quote as say in the book bull's eye unravel the medical mystery of lyme_disease
yale university press 2003 by dr. jonathan a. edlow
the researcher report on the peculiar clustering and name it lyme arthritis dr._malawista 's idea in the journal arthritis and rheumatism in_january 1977
a second article six_month later suggest_that antibiotic could help in some case but not in others which be still medicine 's essential view
dr._malawista and his team make the compelling link between tick and the disease by note_that case be 30 time more frequent on the east_side of the connecticut river where lyme be situate than on the west_side
ticks fee and breed on deer and there be far_more deer on the east_side
dr. steere tell dr. edlow that their success have derive largely from dr._malawista 's management style
he do allow people at_least the potential for a_lot of autonomy dr. steere say
but the yale researcher be wrong in their initial judgment that the disease be cause_by a virus and even wrong that it be truly a new disease
their announcement that it be cause_by only one type_of tick do_not bear out
when symptom turn_out to be much_more diverse than arthritis they change the name to lyme_disease
nonetheless their effort to study a malady that be soon cause anguish well beyond connecticut put them at the center of lyme_disease research
in 1984 yale hold the first international conference on the disease
dr. willy burgdorfer work for the national institutes of health in montana find the bacterium that cause lyme_disease in 1982
yale scientist then develop a vaccine which be license in 1998
it be take off the market in 2002
lyme_disease remain treatable if not always curable
an antibiotic treatment usually wipe_out the infection
if it do_not another course of antibiotic may be administer sometimes intravenously
but bacteria can persist in the body cause harm and illness month or even year after treatment have end

after decide to focus_on inflammation he spend two_year at the national_institute of arthritis and metabolic diseases
he join the yale faculty in 1966 and be chief of rheumatology for 21 year
after his team discover lyme_disease he be describe as thrilled that it could lead to an understanding_of how joint inflammation can arise from infection
he be consider a leader in further understanding_of how the interaction of different kind_of white blood cell drive inflammation
in 1994 the american college of rheumatology present dr._malawista with its distinguished basic investigator award praise his creativity in address problem
he recognize the kernel of the unknown in them the citation say surround them with the know and search through this mechanism for insight in how to answer the question that exist
dr._malawista who share his_mother 's love of theater and music start a vocal chamber music group with his_wife the former tobe anne miller
dr._malawista be also survive_by his half brother david malawista and his stepsister penny ritscher staccioli
dr._malawista remain fascinated by lyme_disease about which many question remain
one puzzle be how the disease can reappear more_than a dozen year after the initial infection
he compare that phenomenon to the dog that do_not bark in a sherlock holmes mystery
what be the immune system if not a guard dog he ask
why have it stop respond to the spirochete in its midst

in an era when most city and state agency struggle under the weight of budget constraint the manhattan district_attorney 's_office this_year find itself in an_unusual position sit on a veritable windfall
in december federal and state authorities secure a record $ 1.92 billion payment from hsbc bank to settle charge that the banking giant transfer billion of dollar for nation under sanction by the united_states enable mexican drug cartel to launder tainted money through the american financial system and work closely with saudi arabian bank link to terrorist organization
for its role in the investigation the manhattan district_attorney 's_office cash a check this_week for $ 169 million slightly more_than twice its total annual budget of $_80 million
cyrus r. vance jr. the manhattan district_attorney say the money would help low crime in public housing project modernize courtroom technology increase cybercrime investigative capability and add program to help keep child out of the criminal justice_system
this be an unprecedented opportunity to enhance public_safety in new_york city mr._vance say
we be share these fund with our colleague in all five borough so that this investment of fund benefit all of new_york city
the payment be the large ever make by the department of justice to a single law_enforcement agency in the nearly three_decade it have be share asset seize or forfeit by defendant in criminal investigation say mythili raman act assistant attorney_general for the department of justice 's criminal division
under robert m. morgenthau the former manhattan district_attorney the office begin investigate multinational bank that be disguise the identity of client in country on united_states sanction list by strip their name from paperwork
settlement with bank by mr._vance 's_office have add $ 900 million in the last four_year to the city and state general fund without_any guarantee that the money would be use on public_safety measure
the new settlement money be arrive through a different financing stream with a requirement that it be spend on law_enforcement purpose and not on continue salary
the money from such settlement have at time raise contentious issue
in_2009 as mr. morgenthau be about to leave office the administration of mayor_michael r._bloomberg apparently seek to embarrass him by raise_question about dozen of unregistered bank_account control by his office that hold ten of million of dollar from settlement forfeiture and seizure
the city later acknowledge it have thousand_of similar account that have not be register with the city comptroller 's_office as be require
john c. liu the city comptroller later say the district_attorney 's_office should register all its account
mr._vance agree and the new settlement money be go into registered account his office say
because the amount_of money be so large the department of justice require that spending plan be approve in advance
the department also require an_annual audit of expenditure by an external auditor
work with the office of the mayor 's criminal justice coordinator john feinblatt mr._vance 's_office have be make plan for the money for several_month
federal guideline would allow mr._vance to direct the money exclusively to his_own office for thing as prosaic as new car or a new office_building but his office choose to share the wealth across the city 's law_enforcement agency
mr._vance say he expect that the money would allow for an increase in his department 's capacity to forensically analyze electronic device something that have become a major component of many investigation and help other district_attorney in the city do the same
the new_york police_department will also probably receive some of the money

denver the san rafael swell with its mile of twist sandstone spire and tower mesa have long be a draw for hiking and canyoneering and have even be consider for designation as a national monument
so last_month when the federal bureau of land management announce its intention to open portion of the 2,000-square mile stretch of central utah for drilling by private oil and ga company conservation group react with alarm
the debate_over the proposed sale of drilling lease have rekindle tension_between those seek to shield wilderness area and the obama_administration which have come under pressure from oil and ga company to develop more public land as it pursue a policy of energy independence
for nearly 100 year the bureau have lease tract of federally manage land to energy company which have seek to tap reserve in oil- and ga rich state like colorado new mexico and utah
dispute over the location of the drilling be not uncommon
but the announcement that dozen of parcel would be auction off in the swell a largely untouched geologic formation come as a surprise to environmental_group who be worried that the administration_'s energy strategy be shift away_from its promise to be environmentally sensitive
we be very surprised and disappointed to see this turn of event say steve bloch legal director for the southern utah wilderness alliance
it_' a step backwards
to see a place like the san rafael swell be put up on the chopping block make no sense
on_monday the utah group along_with several other conservation organization file a formal protest with the bureau ask that it withdraw 55 of the propose lease
the group claim the bureau have not sufficiently weigh the environmental consequence of open part_of the swell for drilling
bureau official_say that recent policy change intend_to slow the leasing process now ensure_that tract of land like those within the swell be carefully examine before drilling be allow
and they have dispute assertion that they be appease energy company which have be critical of the administration for be too restrictive
the b.l.m. be continue to move towards full implementation of more environmentally responsible approach to oil and ga development as outline in our may 2010 leasing reform write celia boddington a bureau spokeswoman in an_e mail
nationally implementation be a work in progress but we be already see positive result
accord_to bureau data formal protest lodge over controversial lease be down to 317 last_year from 1,475 in_2009
lease be also down
in the 2012 fiscal_year some 1,729 be issue the few in any year for a decade accord_to bureau data
the leasing program have face less opposition recently than it do during the bush_administration when conservation organization be mire in legal battle with the federal_government over how tract of land be sell
those dispute boil over during the end of mr. bush 's presidency when 77 oil and ga lease be sell near utah 's national_park and recreation area
an environmental activist tim dechristopher go to prison for buy nearly $ 1.8 million worth of the lease without ever intend_to pay
in_2009 ken salazar the interior secretary withdraw the lease say they have be rush
a year_later the leasing program be revamp seek to better clarify which land be appropriate for drilling
now after energy company nominate lease state bureau office must undertake a more stringent environmental review and leave more time for public_comment before the auction
but environmental_group say those change have be slow to take hold and that parcel be be put up for lease in area_where they have fend off oil and ga drilling in the past
in 2012 in colorado the bureau offer parcel near mesa verde national_park for lease only to defer them before a february auction this_year
a variety of organization include the state 's park and wildlife agency and the national_park service raise_concern about the lease
environmental_group say they expect the land to be propose for leasing again
in utah which have long be grind zero for the fight over public land environmentalist note_that the bureau itself consider some part_of the swell to have wilderness characteristic
the area do_not however have federal protection that would bar drilling altogether
in 2002 gov. mike leavitt suggest_that the bush_administration designate a portion of the swell as a national monument but change his mind after local resident oppose the idea
and there be some who want_to see development move_forward
the environmental_group that be complain do_not really know where the lease be or do_not care say commissioner jeff horrocks of emery county who say many in the mineral rich area feel the swell could be develop while also preserve the environment
cody stewart energy adviser to gov. gary r. herbert of utah say that mr. herbert have no issue with the lease and that there be other part_of the swell that better warrant protection
we do_not see these lease as in high priority conservation area he say
whether the land ultimately go to auction slat for november be unclear
juan palma utah director for the bureau of land management say the bureau be review concern_about drilling in the swell
the bureau recently remove about 1,000 acre from the parcel set_aside for auction though the utah wilderness group note_that that be only a small portion of the contested lease
it be a magnet for nanny and their charge the site of outdoor shakespeare production and a rest spot for visitor to the carroll_gardens greenmarket
it be also home to numerous bench that attract teenager who do with school for the day but not yet ready to go home to other borough linger in small_group for a snack a snatch of gossip and a game or two of pickup basketball
and sometimes too the park draw teenager from the housing project at the edge of the neighborhood
two shot fire on_monday evening near carroll park at the heart of the brownstone neighborhood of carroll_gardens brooklyn seem to fly straight from one world into the other this_week underscore how even in the leafy most coddle of neighborhood the city can still show its rough edge
the police be still investigate the shot along_with a fight involve as many as 20 teenager a few_hour earlier on_wednesday
as speculation grow that a gang from nearby red_hook brooklyn be responsible_for the shooting and the fight parent who frequent the park with their child exchange anxious chatter
others though dismiss the episode as fact of life in an area that have see rapid gentrification in recent_year but whose calm be still interrupt by the occasional mugging or scuffle in the park
it be a big city say glenn kelly 57 who have live in the neighborhood for 36 year and help find friend of carroll park which look after the park
when he first lead the group in the early 1990 graffiti and vandalism be common he say now the playground be crowd with young_child
i do_not mean to dismiss what have happen mr. kelly say but we do_not gain anything by get all bent out of shape
this be not unusual in human history even_though it be unusual for our park
news of the episode spread after mr. kelly 's wife katia kelly write about them on her neighborhood blog pardon me for asking
a local resident have e_mail ms. kelly to say his teenage son have spend several hour in the hospital after be knock unconscious during the afternoon fight
tell your kid to steer clear he write
no_one be hurt in the shooting
though the park be full of child on_wednesday afternoon the recent violence be not far from parent mind
this be where they play before we go to dinner say maria lozada hold her toddler daughter
she_say that she would be more cautious when teenager seem to be gather in the park but that she would not stop come
city_councilman brad lander a democrat who_represent carroll_gardens say the local police inspector have assure him that the precinct would be send more plainclothes and uniformed officer to the park area
he say there be a reasonable likelihood that the afternoon fight and the evening shooting be connect
rub up against the brownstone and cafe of carroll_gardens be the red_hook and gowanus housing project
several teenager in the park say the fight have break out between a gang from the red_hook houses and other teenager
i_feel like there_' such a divide in this neighborhood say sophie mckane who be share a cup of frozen yogurt with her young son on a park bench
it_' so wealthy and gentrified but there_' real deprivation alongside incredible wealth
but many of the teenager who come to the park after school be not from red_hook or gowanus instead live as far_away as harlem the bronx and crown heights and brownsville both in brooklyn
they commute by subway every morning from neighborhood very_different from carroll_gardens
to t. j. smith 17 a senior at brooklyn school for collaborative studies who say he rid three subway line from his home in brownsville to get to school each day the contrast can be surreal
â cause in brownsville thing happen every_day he say

attack have become more frequent this_year with major bombing become almost a daily occurrence
the violence countrywide have increase to a level not see in five_year accord_to the united_nations reinforce fear that the type_of sectarian warfare that grip the country in_2006 and 2007 will reignite

the increase role of shiite militia here be a potentially ominous barometer of the country_'s stability an indication that the shiite majority may have decide it be time once more to fight back against the sunnis
even after the sunni insurgency be tame in 2007 there be less violence but no reconciliation and al_qaeda keep up bombing aim_at restart a sectarian war

in a separate move wednesday also in response to the recent research wellesley college unveil a calculator design to show poor and middle_class student that they would pay only a small fraction of the publish tuition if_they attend the college
similar calculator already exist but wellesley 's may be the simple require many few step
delaware be already one of three state idaho and maine be the others that pay for all high_school junior to take the sat accord_to the college board
delaware begin do so in_2010 11 in reaction to the obama_administration 's race to the top education program
under the new effort pay for by the college board high achieve low_income student will also receive a packet of information on selective college as_well as waiver for the application fee
the information include detail on admission and financial aid policy as_well as on the variation in graduation rate at different college
in a recent experiment by caroline m. hoxby of stanford and sarah e. turner of the university of virginia similar packet increase the number of student who apply to top college
the delaware packet will also include a letter from 10 elite college the member of the ivy league as_well as m.i.t. and stanford say that the student be candidate for admission
the governor and the state 's education secretary will add their_own letter congratulate the student on their success
because delaware be a small state with only about 9,000 high_school senior the new program apply to relatively few student about 80 who be candidate for admission to elite college and an additional 300 with grade and test score high enough to be admit to other four_year college
but official_say they hope the model encourage large state to take similar step
kid have earn opportunity they do_not take david coleman the president of the college board say in an_interview
it_' our mission to fix that
one unresolved question be how college will respond if_they begin receive many more application from low_income student who be qualified for admission
a recent study by dr. hoxby and christopher avery of harvard find that only 34 percent of high achieve high_school senior in the bottom fourth of the income distribution attend any of the country_'s 238 most selective college
many who do_not apply live in small metropolitan area
if more such student be to apply college could face new pressure_on their financial aid budget
an array of college administrator have say they be eager_to recruit more low_income student even_though they have largely fail to do so in recent_year
wellesley a woman 's college outside boston whose alumna include hillary_rodham clinton enroll a large percentage of low_income student than most elite college
still official there say that many high_school student remain confused about how_much it would cost for them to attend and decline to apply
the new calculator which ask anonymously for six piece of financial information include income and home value will help the official_say
the conversation that take_place around college cost be largely misguided say phillip b. levine a professor of economics at the college who develop the calculator
people focus only on the sticker price
the publish cost of a year at wellesley include tuition room and board and fee be $ 57,042
but about 60_percent of student receive financial aid
a typical married couple earn $ 85,000 a year who have no other student in college would pay about_$ 12,000 to send a child to wellesley
a typical couple earn $ 50,000 would pay about_$ 4,000
the calculator somewhat understate the amount that family pay by ignore the money that student themselves pay on top of what their parent pay
most student at wellesley who receive financial aid pay about_$ 5,000 a year through a combination of a loan and wage from a campus job

washington despite deep division that have keep congress from pass new gun safety law for almost two_decade there be one aspect_of gun_control on which many democrats republicans and even the national rifle association agree the need to give mental_health provider better resource to treat dangerous people and prevent them from buy weapon
yet effort to improve the country_'s fray mental_health system to help prevent mass_shooting have stall on capitol_hill tie up in the broad fight over expanded background_check and limit on weapon sale
now the shooting at the washington_navy yard by a man_who authorities_say show telltale sign of psychosis be spur a push to move ahead with bipartisan mental_health policy change
the new debate_over gun_control be begin to turn not on weapon or ammunition but on the question of whether to spend_more money on treat and prevent mental_illness
proponent again face a steep uphill push but they see an opening even_if it remain_unclear whether any change under consideration could have head off the late attack in which the authorities_say aaron_alexis a former_navy reservist buy the shotgun he use in virginia
give the clear connection_between recent mass_shooting and mental_illness the senate should not delay bipartisan legislation that would help address this issue
senators kelly ayotte republican of new_hampshire and mark begich democrat of alaska write wednesday in a joint statement to the senate leadership
the legislation they be push which be hold up when a more sweeping gun measure be defeat earlier_this year would establish program to train teacher to recognize the sign of mental_illness and how to defuse potentially violent situation
senator harry reid of nevada the majority_leader and a strong proponent of the fail senate plan to expand the federal background_check system be resist any move to advance the mental_health provision fear that it would be use as a fig leaf by those_who oppose expanded check while close the door to weapon restriction in the future
both ms. ayotte and mr. begich oppose the gun_control bill that fail in_april
some gun right advocate fear the opposite that open discussion on mental_health could be a back door to a flood of new federal gun law
but several senator like senator richard blumenthal democrat of connecticut who have push for tough gun law since last_year 's elementary_school massacre in newtown conn. see mental_health policy as a way forward
mental_health be really the key to unlock this issue mr. blumenthal say
i_'ve become more and more convinced that we_should establish the mental_health issue as our common ground
but while state lawmaker have take step in recent_year to make buy weapon harder for certain people show sign of mental_illness in place include new_york connecticut and florida where the legislation win the blessing of the national rifle association there be not yet serious discussion in congress of do so
if_you 're have auditory hallucination that ' a sign of schizophrenia say senator tom coburn republican of oklahoma refer_to report that mr._alexis suffer from delusion
though someone like that should not have a gun mr. coburn say he express little faith that congress could come together to write a law to fix that
it_' all politics he say
the senator help lead negotiation on a background_check proposal that fall apart earlier_this year
mr._alexis appear to be only the late gunman whose mental_health issue do_not reach the level at which he would have be prohibit from buy a firearm under federal law
and it be unknowable whether even the most drastic improvement to the nation_'s mental_health system would have catch and treat the symptom of someone like mr._alexis
the same can also be say for law that restrict gun ownership for people with history of mental_illness
the veterans_affairs department say wednesday that on the two time mr._alexis visit an emergency_room in_august he seem alert and deny be depress or thinking of harm himself 1_2 next_page

but one part_of the story remain a tantalizing secret the author 's identity
that literary mystery may have be solve by a professor of english in south_carolina who say this_week that after year of research he have discover the novelist 's name hannah bond a slave on a north_carolina plantation own by john hill wheeler be the actual writer of the bondwoman 's narrative the book sign by hannah crafts

how a house slave with limited access_to education and book be heavily influence by the great literature of her time like bleak house and jane eyre and how she manage to pull_off a daring escape from servitude disguise as a man
the professor gregg hecimovich the chairman of the english department at winthrop university in rock hill s.c. have uncover previously unknown detail about bond 's life that have shed light on how the novel be possibly write
the heavy influence of dickens for_instance particularly from bleak house can be explain by bond 's onetime servitude on a plantation that routinely keep boarder from a nearby girl school the curriculum there require the girl to recite passage of bleak house from memory
bond secretly form her_own novel could have listen while they study or spirit away a copy to read
the research also show that bond may have be give a man 's suit by a member of the wheeler family who be sympathetic to her desire to flee
professor hecimovich 44 say that he have verify the writer 's identity through will diary handwritten almanac and public record
he intend_to publish his full finding in a book tentatively title the life and times of hannah crafts
his work have be review by several scholar who vouch for its authenticity include henry louis gates jr. one of the nation_'s pre eminent scholar of african_american history

hollis robbins the chairwoman of the department of humanities at the peabody institute of johns_hopkins university call it a tremendous finding
i_'m totally convinced she_say to the extent that anything historical can be document without an iphone picture of her write the novel
the book whose language borrow from 19th_century gothic novel trace the story of its narrator who endure life as a slave on a north_carolina plantation and aid by her light complexion successfully escape to the north
that tale closely mirror the story of bond
enslave on a plantation in murfreesboro n.c. bond be believe to have be a self educate woman who work as a maid to the mistress of the house ellen wheeler assist her with errand and personal duty like style her hair
but around 1857 bond disguise herself as a boy and escape flee first to upstate new_york and then to new_jersey where she eventually marry and find work as a schoolteacher
the novel professor hecimovich believe have its beginning in the wheeler home where bond could have have access_to the family 's library and its writing material include a distinctive paper that be use to connect the novel to the wheelers 1_2 next_page

new data be release on_thursday by the census_bureau lend support to that argument show that even as the recession have end the city 's poverty_rate continue to inch up and the gap_between the rich and poor remain stubbornly large
it_' not good_news say david r. jones president of the community_service society a research and advocacy_group
we_'re three_year into a recovery and the poverty_rate be creep upward
i do_not think this have to mean an all out call for class warfare but it_' a serious threat to the viability of the city of new_york
this be go to drag us all down
mr._de blasio who have attract populist support with his message of economic inequality say the late census_data reinforce the need for the next mayor to alter course
i_wish it do_n't he say
his republican opponent joseph_j. lhota have accuse mr._de blasio of promote class warfare but mr._lhota acknowledge on_wednesday that poverty remain a critical problem
there be no question that people be suffer in this economy mr._lhota say
the key to lift people out of poverty be through the creation of career job and education
he say he would focus_on diversify the economy and create additional affordable_housing to ensure more people make it into the middle_class
the poverty_rate rise to 21.2 percent in 2012 from 20.9 percent the year before mean that 1.7_million new_yorkers fall below the official federal poverty threshold
that increase be not statistically significant but the rise from the 2010 rate of 20.1 percent be
despite such a gloomy picture bloomberg_administration official_say the city be fare better_than others
the national recession increase poverty_rate across the country but other major city saw their poverty_rate increase by more_than what_we have see in new_york city largely because we have be a national leader in create job and break the cycle of poverty linda i. gibbs the deputy_mayor for health and human service say
in 2012 the increase in poverty that result from the national recession level off but there remain an enormous amount_of work to do to connect those struggle to new job and opportunity
since 2000 she_say the city have go to 13th high from 6th high among poverty_rate for the 20 big city
the census_data do contain some other good_news
in the city median_household income inch up to $ 50,895 from $ 50,657 after decline for three_year from its recent high of $ 54,695 in 2008
and 6 of the nation_'s 10 large city have high poverty_rate although 4 record decline compare_with 2011
on average new_york have a low poverty_rate few people without health_insurance and a high median_household income than other major metropolitan area
a deep look_at the poverty_rate show that it vary widely and predictably
it be high among black and hispanic new_yorkers
among child 17 and young 31 percent fall below the poverty line
so do 32 percent of family head by a single mother and 19 percent of new_yorkers age 65 and over
fourteen percent have no health_insurance include 4 percent of child under 18
fifty percent of homeowner with mortgage and 54 percent of renter spend 30_percent or more of their income on housing

ms. stephens be refer_to a battle in congress over a farm_bill which some conservative say must reduce spending on food_stamp
joel berg executive_director of the new_york city coalition against hunger say some of the increase in food_stamp recipient could be attribute to government policy like shorten application form and no_longer require finger imaging
still he say one million new_yorkers on medicaid be not get food_stamp and a large_number would be eligible

neha thirani bagri contribute_report from mumbai and bettina wassener from hong_kong
a new study provide the best evidence yet that wear a back brace will slow the progression of the most_common form of scoliosis in adolescent help them avoid painful spine surgery
physician have recommend brace for more_than 50 year but until_now study of its effectiveness have produce mixed result
the united_states preventive services task_force recommend against scoliosis screening in school partly on the ground that there be insufficient evidence_that brace and other conservative treatment relieve back pain or improved quality of life in these child
the new randomized study publish on_thursday in the new_england journal of medicine should end the longstanding debate several expert say and may spur the task_force to reconsider its position
the trial be very convincing say dr. b. stephens richards a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at texas scottish rite hospital in dallas
it scientifically prove that brace treatment work for adolescent with scoliosis who be at risk of curve worsen to the point of need surgery
adolescent girl be more_likely than boy to have idiopathic scoliosis or curvature of the spine from no known cause
rigid bracing be wear to restore spine alignment by external force
it be a demand treatment at a vulnerable time of life
when you have a teenager who be anxious about wear a brace to school or what their friend will think it give us a bit of heartache to try_to convince them if we be not certain ourselves say dr. paul d. sponseller the director of orthopedic surgery at johns_hopkins children_'s center who be not involve in the study
in light of this new evidence we can say we really do have a basis for put them through brace
in the study researcher analyze data on 242 patient at 25 site across the united_states and canada
the child be all age 10 to 15 and still grow and they all have a spinal curvature of 20 to 40 degree
of those patient 116 be randomly assign to observation or brace for at_least 18 hour daily
because too few family agree to randomization the researcher add a group of 126 adolescent who choose for themselves between bracing and observation
bracing be deem a failure if spinal curvature progress to 50 degree or more a point at which surgery be often suggest
it be deem a success if the child achieve skeletal maturity without this degree of curve progression
the trial be stop early because of the apparent efficacy of brace
in the analysis that include both group the rate of treatment success be 72 percent among child with bracing compare_with 48 percent among_those under observation
the benefit increase the longer brace be wear
more_than 90_percent of the child who be successfully treat wear their brace more_than 13 hour a day
dr. richards the immediate past president of the scoliosis research society say the study 's strength be the inclusion criterion limited to adolescent most at risk for spinal curve progression and the use of a high_tech temperature sensitive device in the brace to measure compliance objectively
there be a_lot of doctor like me who treat scoliosis as the primary focus of their practice who have doubt about_whether brace be effective say dr. stuart l. weinstein the lead author of the study and a professor of orthopedic surgery at the university of iowa
now the jury be in
bracing have be the standard of care since the 1940
it take so long to perform a rigorous trial of its effectiveness not only because it be a gargantuan task say joe o'brien the president of the national scoliosis foundation but also because parent do_not want_to just sit there and wait and watch
such a study raise moral challenge too
ethically you have to accept that some patient will be randomized to not use a brace and your presumption be they will end_up need surgery say dr. john t. smith a professor in the orthopedics department at the university of utah
when her_daughter maddie be give a scoliosis diagnosis at age 10 becky houser of north liberty iowa want_to avoid surgery at all cost
so maddie a participant in dr. weinstein 's study choose to wear a brace
we do_not want_to not do_anything say mrs. houser who manage rental property
thirty year_ago she undergo surgery for scoliosis herself spend three week in a hospital and nine month in an upper body cast
after three_year of wear baggy top and yoga pant to school to accommodate the brace maddie now 13 be thrill to learn that her spinal curvature be hold steady at 28 degree
with no more major growth spurt leave she no_longer need brace
we be extremely relieved mrs. houser say
a common surgical treatment spinal fusion entail put screw and rod in the spine to straighten it
the procedure have greatly improve but young patient still face risk like infection bone healing problem and rarely paralysis
despite the apparent success of brace the study do_not pinpoint which child be most_likely to benefit_from it
indeed the researcher find that outcome be successful in 41 percent of the intervention group even_though they seldom wear the brace
conversely erica shumaker a high_school freshman in tipton iowa wear her brace 22 hour a day while participate_in the study
yet her spinal curvature progress and she be likely_to need surgery
her brace be not help as much as they think it would say her_father rick shumaker
but there_' nothing we would do any different
vilamoura portugal for humberto sousa life in vilamoura mean there be only two item on his to do list choose a beach for the day and select a restaurant for the night
tout as europe 's large private resort the 20-square kilometer or 4,924-acre area in the central algarve region be not isolated

what seem to be the resort 's strong attraction be the privacy provide by its large building plot
mr._sousa 's five bedroom villa sit on a 4,277-square meter or 46,037-square foot site in the resort 's old and most exclusive neighborhood pinhal velho portuguese for old pine
the 605-square meter single level white concrete home purchase by mr._sousa in 2007 be design by castello branco architect of lisbon to include the outdoors

the villa 's back patio run the width of the house and be shade by a pergola and an establish pine tree that push up between two of the white concrete beam
the gently sloping lawn run down to a square pool near the bottom of the property and through a cluster of pine to the adjacent millennium golf_course
a neighbor 's home be almost completely obscure by pine
with wind whip red stone cliff to the west and dry hilly land to the east vilamoura sit conveniently in central algarve make up one point of what local call the golden triangle of exclusive property the other two be vale do lobo and quinta do lago pleasingly set among score of old pine tree

portugal 's economic_crisis have see the housing market stumble over the last four_year although suzana bento manage_director of mapro real_estate in the nearby town of almancil say thing finally be start to look up this_year

the program already have draw chinese and indian investor ms. bento say
also retired expatriate who_live part time in portugal can become exempt from portuguese taxation on their pension
washington few american president have hold a deep belief in the power of the write word than president_obama
and in few way have that belief be more test than in his frustrating private correspondence with the leader of iran a country with which the united_states have have no diplomatic tie for 34 year
this_week mr._obama indicate_that he may finally have find a pen pal in tehran
at the core of iran_'s recent diplomatic charm offensive a process that have include the release of 11 prominent political prisoner and a series of conciliatory statement by top iranian official be an exchange of letter confirm by both_side between mr._obama and president_hassan rouhani
the election of mr._rouhani a moderate in_june kindle hope that diplomacy may end the chronic impasse with iran over its_nuclear ambition
but the letter and the cautious hope they have generate suggest there be a genuine opportunity for change
it be not the first_time since enter the white_house that mr._obama have put pen to paper to try_to sway iran_'s leadership
until_now he have have little to show for it even under the pain of punish economic sanction the iranian government have show little interest in negotiate a deal_with washington on its_nuclear program
this time mr._rouhani say in an nbc news interview broadcast on_wednesday the tone of mr._obama 's letter be positive and constructive
he_add it could be subtle and tiny step for a very_important future
mr._obama speak to the spanish language network telemundo on_tuesday say there be indication that mr._rouhani be somebody who be look to open dialogue with the west and with the united_states in a way that we have not see in the past
and so we_should test it
the president have test iran before
have promise as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemy he send a letter early in his first term to iran_'s supreme_leader ayatollah ali khamenei propose a new diplomatic chapter
ayatollah khamenei send a reply but fail to take mr._obama up on his offer
their correspondence be cut short after iran_'s dispute presidential_election in_june 2009 unleash a popular uprising
the ensue bloody crackdown all but snuff out diplomacy for the next_year
the re elect president mahmoud_ahmadinejad write a lengthy letter to mr._obama in_2010 but it do nothing to break the diplomatic ice
the white_house decline to discuss the content of mr._obama 's letter to mr._rouhani
but a senior administration_official say it reflect the president 's judgment that mr._rouhani should be take very seriously in part_because he appear to have a broad mandate within iran
this be the first_time that mr._obama have write directly to an iranian president and not the supreme_leader
that suggest_that the white_house believe ayatollah khamenei have empower mr._rouhani at_least for now to seek an opening with the west
mr. ahmadinejad though not as hostile to a nuclear agreement as sometimes portray be undermine by other senior official and do_not enjoy the supreme_leader 's full confidence
the administration_'s previous position be that we correspond with the person_who make decision say ray takeyh an iran expert at the council on foreign_relations
now they_'re send them to rouhani
another major difference be that the new exchange of letter come in the wake of the administration_'s agreement with russia to seek the peaceful transfer of syria_'s chemical_weapon
to make that plan work analyst_say it would be helpful for iran as the staunch regional ally of president_bashar al_assad of syria to play a constructive role
whether that be possible be highly questionable of course
but it give mr._obama a broad diplomatic context in which to engage mr._rouhani
the united_states have generally insist on negotiate with iran purely on its_nuclear program which have leave both_side with little to talk_about after the inevitable clash over the number of centrifuge or the amount_of enrich uranium that the iranians be produce
at the end of the day obama stumble into diplomacy because of what_happen with syria say trita parsi president of the national iranian american council who have write a book about mr._obama 's diplomatic effort a single roll of the dice
iran_'s news_medium have report that mr._obama 's letter include a plea to re engage_in diplomacy a suggestion depend_on how any talk go that the united_states would be willing_to ease sanction and a request to initiate direct discussion between washington and tehran something diplomat say be critical to strike a nuclear deal
none of this should be a big surprise
the united_states have long be eager for direct talk with iran
the big question be whether mr._rouhani be in the position to make concession on a nuclear_program that tehran insist be for peaceful purpose and that the united_states suspect be aim_at achieve the ability_to produce nuclear_weapon
if direct negotiation be to begin mr._obama 's letter writing skill may again be call into play
presidential correspondence say dennis b. ross who advise mr._obama on iran at the white_house be use often in negotiation as a form of assurance or clarification
mr. ross say the president 's reliance on letter to iranian leader make_sense because in the absence of a formal relationship there be few other fully authoritative way to convey a message we completely control
the letter his adviser say also reflect the value that mr._obama attach to direct diplomacy
mr._obama and mr._rouhani both plan to speak to the united_nations general_assembly on_tuesday
will they try an even more direct form of diplomacy greet each_other in person
the white_house say nothing be plan
for now though mr._obama 's pen pal diplomacy have accomplish the most basic goal of any letter
it get a reply
london
the beauty of the champions_league and the beast within it be in full display on the second night of the tournament
we_should never tire of admire lionel messi surely the fine artist in the sport
at time his rivalry with cristiano ronaldo seem to defy the accepted wisdom that soccer be a team game
how do we account for ronaldo score a hat trick in istanbul on a tuesday and then messi rise to the challenge and notch three impudent goal of his_own in barcelona the follow evening
each messi goal come from his left_foot the first an immaculate 25-yard free kick that brush a post before it nestle in the top corner of the net
goal 2 and 3 be low deft placement as the little argentine dare defender to touch him and then he dodge them as they try
with another goal head in by gerard pique barã§a hammer ajax 4 0
messi 's accumulation of score after score in the champions_league have give him the best goal to game ratio since european club competition begin in the 1950s
his 62 goal in 80 match compare to raãºl 's 71 in 144 ruud van nistelrooy 's 60 in 88 andrey shevchenko 's 59 in 116 and ronaldo 's 54 in 96
one almost feel sorry for ronaldo
even his career total of 21 hat trick do_not match messi 's 24
yet wednesday be not simply one special player 's night
the swiss team fc basel come from a goal down to defeat chelsea the 2012 european champion 2_1 on chelsea 's turf in london
that be historic because basel have visit england 10 time before without win once
chelsea score first through their brazilian player oscar but little by little the swiss team that cost a pittance compare to chelsea overhaul that lead
first mohamed salah a 21-year old from egypt curl a shot around fullback ashley cole use the defender to hide the ball from goalkeeper petr cech until it be too late
then marco streller basel 's 32-year old captain guide the ball inside cech 's near post with a header follow a corner kick
jose mourinho back as chelsea coach six_year after owner roman abramovich fire him say that he be not shock by the defeat and that he would be at his workplace at 7 the next morning to put it right
we be punish in our defensive corner where we be strong mourinho say
emotionally this be not a very mature team
his implication be that chelsea need rebuild
john terry do_not play at all and frank lampard be miss from the midfield at the end so chelsea be lack in leadership
the owner visit the player dressing_room afterward and one good question for him to ask be why fernando torres the man for whom chelsea pay â£50 million or $_80 million be not even on the bench
and why juan mata last_season 's most inspirational forward appear only as a substitute
chelsea it have to be say be try_to be a different team from the first one that mourinho build into a pragmatic and methodical but win unit
i would like to say it be a miracle but we make it in tottenham and we make a draw in manchester streller say refer_to draw in previous europa and champions_league match
once it be 1_1 tonight i tell the boy we can win here
he smile before add and they listen_to me
on the same night arsenal stretch its run of away victory in the champions_league to a record break 10 straight game
arsenal 's french coach arsã¨ne wenger take his team to southern france where it beat marseille 2_1
we have be audacious away explain wenger where sometimes we play with the hand brake at home because we lack that confidence
his team ride its luck in a patchy first hour during which the diminutive mathieu valbuena often give marseille the edge in creativity
but after marseille have miss their chance arsenal capitalize on a defensive howler from jeremy morel
his attempt_to clear with a header looped into the air and as it drop theo walcott keep his eye on the ball and sweetly volley it high and handsomely into the goal
twenty minute later aaron ramsey allow the move ball to cross in front of him then outwit his marker with a smart turn and a low shot that deflect off the foot of defender nicolas n'koulou into the net
in stoppage time one marseille brother andre ayew win a penalty kick that the other jordan ayew convert
that be a mere consolation arsenal the club that pay â¬50 million or $ 67 million for one player mesut ãzil have beat marseille which spend slightly less_than that to acquire six new team member in the summer
food for thought there
the best the player who can make a world of difference come at a price that few and few team can_afford
one club that come close last_season to disprove that theory be the champions_league finalist borussia dortmund
in the pour rain in southern italy on_wednesday dortmund lose more_than the game_against napoli
the german side concede goal to gonzalo higuaã­n and lorenzo insigne and with juan zãºã±iga gift dortmund an own goal near the end the match finish 2_1 in favor of napoli
dortmund compound defeat by lose its dignity
its goalkeeper captain roman weidenfeller be red card before halftime after rush out of his penalty area and deliberately use his hand to prevent a scoring opportunity
but weidenfeller 's be an impulsive mistake
what dortmund 's coach jã¼rgen klopp do midway_through the first_half be beyond condone
he be outrage by the opening napoli goal while his defender neven subotic be off the field be treat for an injury
klopp often the joker of dortmund rag at the fourth official mock him bawl into his face appear to physically threaten him
rightly klopp be send to the stand and no_doubt uefa will ban him for further match
but this be the beast of soccer the ugly face that any right minded parent will not allow their child to view on youtube
prague reconstructing a protect yet neglect property in prague 's historic old town be a challenge olena yakubovych head of y&t property investment fully embrace
in early 2012 she come across a disused functionalist style residence on a quiet side street just step from the city 's national theater and envision an apartment_building with a trio of luxury unit that become art residence national theater
in prague the top end of the property market have remain unscathed by the economic_crisis ms. yakubovych say add that there continue to be demand for luxury property in the city particularly in the old town an area on the list of unesco world heritage sites
the area originally a medieval settlement date from the ninth century now be a collection of architectural style include neo gothic renaissance cubist and functionalist
for ms. yakubovych the development of a luxury property must reflect the building 's history combine original feature with modern touch
the flat that we like to do the most be in traditional building from the beginning of the 20th_century she_say
i always try_to see the potential in an old building
sometimes i can even picture the design of the door handle
the art residence build date from the mid-1930 and be one of the first building in the city to use a steel reinforce concrete structural system rather_than the traditional wooden core
the renovation which include replace the damage roof require permit from five authorities
while the bureaucracy may_seem daunting many observer say it have help preserve the old town as the number of historic renovation have increase
the single hardest issue with work on building in the historical center be balance the client 's wish with what the city authorities will allow say danyal downer of ian bryan architects a local agency
the heritage department be often see as the enemy but the truth be that without their intervention the city center would quickly lose its charm
art residence 's flagship apartment name l'art de vivre cover the building 's top floor offer special view of the national theater from the kitchen 's dining nook
the two_bedroom two and a half bath property be on the market for 34 million czech koruna or $ 1.76 million
the two other unit already have be sell the 205-square meter or 2,207-square foot gallery apartment for 24 million koruna and the 105-square meter mosaic apartment for 12_million koruna
both of those apartment be on the sixth floor of the building the unit on the low floor be sell as unfinished shell
l'art de vivre apartment have 165 square meter of live space with a 110-square meter terrace off the living_room
it run the length of the apartment and offer glimpse of prague castle petrin hill and the astronomical clock as_well as the national theater and the academy of sciences
the main bedroom have its_own 48-square meter terrace
the apartment be name after a 1917 vessel now use as a river cruise barge in france a title inspire_by the slant roof of the main room which ms. yakubovych say bring to mind a hull
the ba relief wood paneling in a stormy sea gray that be use throughout the apartment set_off the decor 's light cream white and gray
the fitting include inlaid marble flooring in the foyer hide walk in closet and storage space as_well as private elevator access
parking and extra storage be available in the basement next_door to the laboratorio scuola di cucina cook school which share its official opening with the unveiling of art residence in may.
the apartment reflect the building 's name with modern chandelier in the living_room and bedroom create by the glasswork preciosa in the town of jablonec nad nisou
also ira svobodova a local artist create a series of abstract geometric painting for the apartment most of which be sell at the launch party on may 22
ms. yakubovych and ms. svobodova have cooperate on project previously
for ms. yakubovych the art residence reflect both its interior design and the surroundings
with this property the location be key she_say
this area be very interesting because it_' very close to everything
the developer say she believe such project be the future of old town as they will draw more resident into the city center and revitalize it as more_than just a tourist spot
london when a judge rule that a 22-year old muslim defendant must remove her full_face veil during testimony albeit behind a screen so that only the judge jury and lawyer may track her facial response there be much heady talk_about the implication for europe 's restless and unresolved struggle with issue of faith and identity tolerance and freedom
but a pithier riposte come from salma yaqoob a muslim and former city councilwoman in birmingham who rhetorically ask a reporter from the guardian whether the full_face veil the niqab should really absorb so_much debate in a land seize with far broad social and economic challenge
be this the big issue we face in the u.k. right_now she ask
but it be not an issue that be likely_to go away four day_after the court ruling there be report that 17 hospital have also order staff to remove full_face veil when in contact with patient
and the question arise whether the furor be not so_much about the niqab a supposed symbol of piety as the telltale marker of a deep sense of difference_between faith sharpen by year of war in muslim land abroad that wrench britain 's social fabric at home
the debate be not new
in_2006 question_about the niqab arise in the case of aishah azmi a 24-year old teaching assistant who be dismiss from her job for refuse_to remove the full_face veil in class
at that time a year after the london bombing of july 2005 britons be in a state of shock after their brutal encounter with islamic militancy when four suicide bomber kill 52 traveler on the london transit system
tony blair then the prime_minister call the full_face veil a mark of separation contradict the vaunted striving of a society that for decade seek to place ethnic and religious diversity ahead of enforce integration
the temperature of debate this time seem low but there be other portent
britain 's muslim population be significantly big rise from 1.6 million or 3_percent of the population in 2001 to 2.8 million accord_to the washington base pew forum on religion and public life an increase that make britain 's muslim minority europe 's third most populous after those in france and germany
while congregation dwindle in traditional christian church islam be grow
society be change offer new challenge and perhaps a new assertiveness among muslims that unsettle those_who expect a degree of pliancy from their minority
britain have a proud tradition of attract and welcome religious minority of offer them refuge from persecution and a place_where they can practice their faith freely the conservative daily telegraph say in an editorial
but one reason why our society be both diverse and relatively peaceful be because we ask that people respect our value and do_not resist integration
in this_week 's court case judge peter murphy rule on a core principle establish over century of open justice say that if a fair trial be to take_place the jury and for some limited purpose the judge must be_able to assess the credibility of the witness
in my judgment the adversarial trial demand full openness and communication judge murphy say
i be fairly convinced that the wearing of the niqab necessarily hinder that openness and communication
by inference too the case raise_question about the state 's right to curtail individual freedom particularly in the name of security concern
i_think it_' for woman to make a choice about what clothes they wish to wear say theresa may the home secretary
if_they wish to wear a veil that be for a woman to make a choice
but she continue there will be some circumstance in which it_' right for public body for_example at the border at airport security to say there be a practical necessity for ask somebody to remove a veil
the debate be not limited to britain or europe suggest a broad social questioning as the tectonic plate of religion seem to shift
france for_instance outlaw the wearing of the full_face veil in public place two_year ago
under rule reflect the country_'s distinctive and cherished secularism religious symbol like crucifix jewish yarmulke and islamic head scarf be ban from school in france
accord_to the daily newspaper le monde last_month the authorities now want_to extend the prohibition to university
in quebec the separatist government release a plan last_week to prevent government worker from wear overt and conspicuous religious symbol include an array of turban skull cap and large cross

in his introduction though mr._mccain make an effort to dispel the idea that he be anti russian a perception that be widespread here
i be not anti russian mr._mccain write
i be pro russian more pro russian than the regime that misrules you today
i make that claim because i respect your dignity and your right to self determination he continue address the russian people
you should be govern by a rule of law that be clear consistently and impartially enforce and just
i make that claim because i believe the russian people no less_than americans be endow by our creator with inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he_add
while mr._mccain write that he do_not believe a russian citizen could publish similar criticism such complaint appear frequently in the russian press especially online where there be generally no censorship even as the government retain fairly strong control over what be show on the major television station particularly in news_report
mr._putin speak thursday at an_annual conference of western academic and policy analyst ridicule mr._mccain for submit the article to pravda which he suggest be proof that the american senator be lock in an outdated cold_war mind set

of course pravda be a respectable publication of the now oppositional communist_party but its level of distribution in the country be minimal
mr._putin insist_that there be nothing anti american in his article in the times and he say mr._mccain have be invite to the conference call the valdai discussion club after the russian town where it be hold
mr._putin usually hold a private dinner with the valdai group but to note the event 's 10th anniversary the invitation list be broaden to include several opposition politician and journalist who be give limited access
mr._putin use his remark and a question and answer session to touch on a wide_range of subject and he portray the event itself as proof that there be no suppression of speech in russia
at one point mr._putin defend a new russian law ban propaganda on nontraditional sexual relation which be widely perceive as intend_to suppress homosexuality
he say that the law do_not discriminate but also that europeans be die out in part_because of societal acceptance of gay relationship
even as he suggest_that mr._mccain be stick in the past mr._putin raise his_own complaint with a cold_war edge
once we be promise that nato will not cross the eastern border of germany he say
we discuss it and gorbachev be give a promise though it be not register anywhere
and now where be nato
and where be the border
we be simply dupe
mr._mccain cite the propaganda law in his article criticize mr._putin 's government
they write law to codify bigotry against people whose sexual orientation they condemn he write
he do_not defend united_states policy but accuse mr._putin of shield the government of president_bashar al_assad of syria
how have he strengthen russia 's international stature
mr._mccain ask
by ally russia with some of the world 's most offensive and threaten tyranny
mr._mccain be not the first member of congress to respond to mr._putin in the russian news_medium
on_monday kommersant one of russia 's most_prominent daily newspaper print an open letter to the russian people by representative steve israel of new_york the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee
in his letter which he also publish on his web_site mr. israel explain in leveled language why he would potentially vote in favor of a military_strike on syria although he praise mr._putin 's effort to persuade mr._assad 's government to surrender its chemical_weapon arsenal
diplomacy should always be the first preference mr. israel write

paris a lithuanian custom officer in kosovo work for a european_union mission there be shoot dead on_thursday in the serb dominate north of the country european_union official_say
the european_union mission that oversee judicial affair in northern kosovo say in a statement that the shooting take_place early thursday during a routine staff rotation
it say a murder investigation be under_way
bernd borchardt head of the mission know as eulex call the attack an unequivocal ambush say stojan pelko a european_union spokesman
mr. pelko say by_telephone from pristina kosovo 's capital that six custom officer travel in two car be return from a border crossing when one of the car be fire on critically wound the lithuanian custom officer
he be dead on arrival at a hospital
the associated_press cite a hospital chief say the man have be shoot in the chest and leg
mr. pelko say the other officer in the car a czech have no visible wound but have be take to the hospital
he say that it be not know_how many_people be involve in the attack and that the area have be seal by police_officer
we do_not know who shoot him and the perpetrator escape he say
we be ask citizen for any information they can provide and we be look for witness
the european_union mission condemn the attack call it an act of cowardly violence
the bloc 's foreign_policy chief catherine ashton condemn the killing and call on serbs and ethnic albanians to redouble effort to press_ahead with an agreement aim_at overcome ethnic enmity in the country
the shooting come as kosovo and serbia have be try_to carry_out a power share accord that the two country sign in_april
the agreement under which serbia agree to recognize pristina 's authority over the police and the court in the north in return for great autonomy for kosovo 's northern serbs have be greet with deep ambivalence and in some case outright hostility by some of the north 's 50,000 serbs
while the agreement stop short of serbs recognize kosovo 's independence which belgrade vehemently oppose it have be laud by the european_union which broker it as a breakthrough that could help overcome ethnic division and cement peace in the region
some serbs however have vow to resist the accord boycott municipal election plan for early november and leave kosovo
the european_union mission have be oversee the police court and custom in kosovo which declare independence from serbia in 2008
while a majority of serbs reject kosovo 's independence the north in particular have remain a conflict zone because until_recently a majority of serbs there live almost entirely under belgrade 's authority
serbian flag fly in the serbian part_of mitrovica local drink serbian brew and belgrade have pay the salary of municipal official
georgios makeroufas a political adviser to the european_union 's rule of law mission in northern kosovo say from kosovo that it be too early to assess the fallout from the killing or whether it would further inflame ethnic tension
but he emphasize that so_far thing be relatively quiet
but analyst_say the european_union face a daunting challenge to ensure_that the power sharing agreement be put into effect with resistance from many serbs in the north as_well as from a vocal minority of ethnic albanians in kosovo who argue_that the accord entrench division
in a sign of the obstacle ahead staff_member in the office grant kosovo identification_card in the north have have hand grenade lob at their home while one senior administrator be shoot in the leg late last_year
angela_merkel have a reputation as something of an enigma
biographer commentator and political opponent have create a cottage industry of merkel astrology around a leader that everyone find hard to read
with a general_election schedule in germany for sunday a poll at which the chancellor be likely_to win a mandate for a third_term speculation be rife about merkel_'s political course especially on foreign_policy
but contrary to widely hold belief the chancellor 's position be in fact not all that difficult to identify
merkel have basically make three fundamental decision that have define the structure of her foreign_policy
the first decision be to ensure_that germany reject any kind_of geopolitical ambition
the country have be a very useful enabler of the european_union 's foreign_policy in the western balkans but it have shy away_from strengthen europe 's diplomatic or military capability in more substantial structural way
the same be true for nato where germany have forward a number of initiative on technical issue but be see as disengage from the big strategic discourse on the future of the western alliance in a change global security landscape
merkel have unenthusiastically heed old german military commitment in afghanistan and kosovo but she have keep germany firmly out of entanglement in the new type_of crisis management operation that be emerge_from the crisis in libya mali and syria
in all of this she can feel safely in agreement with the overwhelming majority of the german public
in the absence of large more global ambition what matter most in assess merkel_'s foreign_policy be her decision in relation to europe
this be where the crisis of the european single currency have force her against her instinct to become a decisive player and a risk taker
it be in this field that merkel_'s other two fundamental foreign_policy decision fall and it be here that her foreign_policy legacy will be define
her second decision be to turn the euro_zone into a de facto transfer union lite by guarantee the currency 's survival with pledge of billion of german taxpayer euro
in return she have since be push for immediate structural economic reform in the recipient country combine with medium- to long_term project such as fiscal union and joint oversight instrument like the european stability mechanism
a bank union be still in limbo but may complete the picture in the not so distant future
all of these effort have one thing in common more or less strict oversight over a nation_'s financial and economic_policy
none of this would have be thinkable only a few_year ago
this mean in simple term that merkel have preside_over a substantial deepening of e.u. economic integration
with the measure she have take to remedy the crisis now firmly in place the european_union have integrate faster and more substantially than in any previous five_year period
true most of this have not be wholly voluntarily
much of it be dictate by the crisis
but in the end it be largely merkel who design or enable these great integrationist leap forward
merkel_'s third decision be perhaps the most fateful one
the german chancellor have determine that she favor a politically less integrate europe after the crisis
in_august she announce in a radio interview that now be the time to think_about give some power back from brussels to the member state
she do_not go into specific but add that europe from now on would not_necessarily require more common policy with decision make by the brussels base institution
improve governance could be achieve through better coordination among member state
this victory for merkel_'s long stand intergovernmental instinct over an age old german pro integration tradition be nothing less_than revolutionary particularly when compare_with the ideology of helmut kohl under whose tutelage she enter the political stage
perhaps it be mean to counterbalance the enormous push toward close economic integration
but it be clear that again merkel have ally herself with the majority of germans who think that europe 's economic side be great but that its political side be increasingly sinister
merkel_'s third decision be risky
first of all it rest on the flawed assumption that economic and political integration can be separate from each_other when the basic lesson of the euro crisis be that you_can not have one without the other
second it fatefully tie her to the politically weaken british prime_minister david_cameron who share her vision of repatriate many government function and favor intergovernmental deal make over the e.u. 's classic community method but whose inability to control his_own party be cause him existential problem at home
third merkel_'s decision rip the very engine out of the entire integration idea that germany europe 's historically problematic core country underwrite the ever fragile idea of european politics transcend the merely national
of merkel_'s three fundamental foreign_policy decision strategic abstention be understandable but unsustainable in the long run her recipe to tackle the crisis be probably correct but could create severe collateral damage and her intergovernmental turn revolutionize the integration project by risk some of its historic achievement
expect merkel_'s post election foreign_policy to be build around these three foundation
if it work out which it could it be pure genius
if not generation from now historian will wonder_what drive that enigmatic woman

it need more psychic atmosphere say fiona shaw the distinguished actress and as of last_month the director of the metropolitan opera 's new production of tchaikovsky 's eugene onegin
she be stand in an aisle in the met 's auditorium during a rehearsal break one recent friday star up at the stage like it be a gifted child have trouble fulfil its potential
the new onegin be be a bit of a troublesome child itself
put on opera be always full of unexpected turn and unpleasant compromise
but this onegin which open the met 's season on_monday have take an unusually precipitous tumble from sure thing a pinnacle of russian music feature the most eminent russian soprano and russian conductor of our time in a production by a widely admire theater director make her met debut to headache plague
for one thing that admire director deborah warner who lead the production 's first iteration at the english national opera in_2011 undergo an_unexpected surgical procedure this_summer and could_not come to the met
ms._shaw her longtime collaborator on broadway production of medea and the testament of mary among_others who have also never direct at the met take on the assignment at what in opera amount to the very last minute
the met approve the switch even_though ms._shaw have a partly overlapping commitment to direct britten 's rape of lucretia for the glyndebourne festival 's fall tour back in england a project she have no intention of shortchanging
she have also direct three production for the english national opera since 2008
so after start rehearsal for onegin on_aug. 13 ms._shaw leave new_york on_sept. 6
her only subsequent visit to the city be that recent friday sept._13 to work on the first and third act and give note to the cast before fly back in the evening
she stand in the darkened auditorium half illuminate behind the lighting board in constant motion seek atmosphere while the soprano anna netrebko pour out her heart onstage and valery gergiev conduct with his customary inscrutable hand flutter in the pit
ms._shaw point to a spot on the stage then another and another
the light would change as she go make abrupt shift from cool white to rich yellow and back again as she and the designer try out different option for the classic story draw from pushkin 's verse novel about miss attempt at love between a bookish girl and a bored aristocrat
with the addition of some light from the wing a scene that have seem stark suddenly turn warm a forbid character become in the glow of a well place spot heart wrench
atmosphere gradually emerge but the work be complex slow and frustrating and ms._shaw need to get a_lot do in very little time
the down side of her arrangement with the met be that ms._shaw be never able_to see the second act with its grand ball scene and harrowing duel onstage with the orchestra not to mention any of the show 's final run throughs
nor as of press time do she plan to return for opening_night
all of this be extremely unusual for such a prominent production particularly at the met which these_day loudly and proudly tout its theatrical bona fides
the basic direction be do say the met 's general_manager peter gelb in an_interview
most of the detail work be do now it_' really a question of just follow it up and make_sure people remember what they_'re suppose_to be do
mr. gelb say that he and the production team could together handle the execution of what he call ms._shaw 's meticulous note in her absence there_' always some amount_of fine tuning go on but the basic blocking of the movement of the performer everything they_'re do be set
direction in a production 's final stage though be not just about set the blocking
it be also about tiny detail about be on the scene to approve small yet tell shift from the light to the acting and to experience the full production and make last minute suggestion
it_' an_unusual situation mr. gelb acknowledge
besides the scheduling issue with ms._shaw there be the matter of the petition
the online petition that_is sign by almost 9,000 that criticize president_vladimir v._putin 's antigay policy in russia that say tchaikovsky be gay which many music scholar believe but be not universally accept at the moment and that call on the met to dedicate the opening_night performance to the issue
mr._putin who in_june sign the law ban propaganda on nontraditional sexual relationship be not as distant from this onegin as one may think
he have be a crucial backer of mr. gergiev the director of the mariinsky theater in st. petersburg
mr._putin be the featured speaker at the gala opening of the gleam mariinsky ii theater in may when he also award mr. gergiev a recently revive soviet era prize the hero of labor award
mr. gergiev and ms. netrebko be vocal supporter of mr._putin 's 2012 presidential campaign
the met while express its displeasure with the law have resist the idea of dedicate opening_night to anything 1_2 next_page
athens
the perfect political storm for violent extremism have descend on greece
it consist of national humiliation economic disaster high immigration political division and international tutelage
look no further than weimar germany to understand its ingredient
in the subdued street of the greek capital where a vague menace hang like a pall temper be frayed
the economy be turn slowly after draconian cut and two bailouts total â¬240 billion but not enough yet to be feel
the cry of the extreme right resounds we the father of civilization have be sell_out by the international loan shark
these be familiar insinuation
it be well known where they can lead
the neo nazi golden_dawn party be rise from a negligible fringe group in_2009 to what be almost_certainly the country_'s third political force today represent close to 15_percent of the vote accord_to poll
if the most acute phase of greece_'s economic_crisis have pass the most acute phase of its political trial be upon it
i have little doubt that if greece be not part_of the european_union with the protection and example afford by this much malign democratic club it would have tumble into catastrophe by now much as a humiliate germany do after 1918
europe have be greece_'s protector even as the single euro currency have be its tormentor
a typical confrontation occur the other morning
alex soultos who work in the jewelry business be in a shouting match
a graduate of northeastern university who return to athens from boston in_2009 he be make his way through a crowd of striker outside the ministry of administrative reform and e governance when he lose it
you should be work instead of block the road
he scream his american work ethic boil up
his business be in a downward spiral in an economy that have shrink by a quarter
a group of woman scream abuse back at him
at our age they demand where can we find job
they be among the 2,000 school guard who be oust as the government scramble to find 12,500 public employee it could shift by the end of this_month to meet a deadline set by greece_'s international creditor
we have bill vespina papadopoulou shout
but as kyriakos mitsotakis the minister responsible_for the cut explain to me inside the besiege ministry the message from the troika the international_monetary fund the european commission and the european central_bank be clear if_you do_not do it no more money
europe 's requirement be reform or else
greece with an_estimate $ 3.3 billion shortfall in its social_security fund this_year and a large financing gap loom over the next two_year still need money if much less_than before
more urgently it need international understanding
the combination of the demand of the troika widely see by greeks as a trojan horse for germany and the frustration evident outside the ministry soultos 's private_sector have lose close to 1.5_million job as unemployment have reach 28 percent be combustible
i watch antonis samaras the conservative prime_minister give an impassioned speech this_week in which he speak of the way democracy breed its_own enemy which be basically extremism
he warn_that greece be in the blind_spot before improvement be feel a few crucial month that be not the most difficult but be the most politically sensitive
golden_dawn have be on a rampage
the police say one of its activist be responsible_for the stab to death this_week of pavlos fyssas a leftist hip_hop singer who have denounce the party
in recent_week golden_dawn supporter have manhandle a mayor try_to honor victim of the civil_war and attack communist_party sympathizer leave nine hospitalize
samaras be squeeze between the demagoguery of this rampant right and the populism of the left wing anti austerity syriza party which be promise to restore most if not all of what have be lose since greece in the local phrase fall from the cloud
troika official will visit athens next_week
if_they make further demand for cut in wage and pension they could push greece over the edge
germany have not yet learn to play the benign superpower
it be time and after the german election this sunday there may be a little more wiggle room
toughness toward greece have play well in germany but as mitsotakis put it the country have be stretch to its limit
this need to be very very clear
in fact of course germany have also save greece from bankruptcy
it do so for the european_union which help usher germany from its cataclysmic zero hour of 1945
through europe germany come_back
through europe greece have be save from the fate of weimar
at a time when pettiness surround think_about the e.u. and the assumption be widespread that the union 's peacemaking role be over it be critical to recall that the union be europe 's sure safeguard against the continent 's dark hour

when the brooklyn democratic establishment gather for breakfast at junior 's a few_day after the primary election most eye be on bill_de blasio the presumptive nominee for mayor who doled out hug and kiss as he navigate the room
but in the background several member of the city_council none of them from brooklyn be also work the crowd
as guest din on egg and lox mark s. weprin from queens annabel palma from the bronx and daniel r. garodnick from manhattan whose wife have give_birth to the couple 's second son day_before make their way to each table shake hand and greet people with
hey how be you and great to see you
there be no need to explain_why they be there
the unsaid thing be that they_'re all run for council speaker frank r. seddio the chairman of the brooklyn democratic_party say later
the speaker of the council elect by the member be arguably the second most influential official in the city and the position will become vacant in_january when the current speaker christine c. quinn leave office after her defeat in this_year 's race for the democratic nomination for mayor
ms._quinn who be elect speaker in_2006 defeat bill_de blasio who last_week defeat her in the primary bring a new forceful power to the post and impose discipline on a panel that have previously be view as unruly
she use her position to block legislation that she often in alliance with mayor_michael r._bloomberg oppose and likewise to rally vote for legislation that she support
the election to replace her will not take_place until january after the member elect in november take office
but the campaigning have be under_way for month and have intensify since last_week 's democratic_primary since if history be any guide almost all member of the council will be democrats
by tradition county party organization play a significant role in the election of the speaker in some instance essentially dictate vote after horse trading involve committee chairmanship and patronage job
and ideology play a role too although the post will be choose by democrats some of the council 's democratic member be significantly more liberal than others
the choice be complicate as so_many thing in new_york city politics be by gender and race
although white make up a minority of the city it appear highly likely that the next mayor will be a white man both the democratic and republican nominee be white man and also likely that the next comptroller will be a white man the democratic nominee be heavily favor
the outcome of the race for public_advocate the only other elect citywide post be unclear there will be a democratic runoff between a black_woman and a white man on_oct. 1 there be no republican_candidate
if there be no black or latino on the democratic ticket i_think there will be a_lot of pressure to pick a minority member for speaker george arzt a veteran democratic political consultant say
you_can not have four white man
multiple member have be mention as candidate in_addition to mr. weprin mr. garodnick and ms. palma they include james vacca of the bronx inez e. dickens and melissa mark viverito of manhattan and jumaane d. williams of brooklyn
mr. williams who be african_american say in an_interview that pick a member of a minority group as speaker should be a priority
i_think that be something that should be push he say
beyond ethnicity all of the candidate have strength and weakness
ms. dickens be a close ally of ms._quinn which could be a problem for her if mr._de blasio choose to get involve in the race
she have also be the subject of several negative story in the new_york post recently about her role as a landlord in harlem
mr. garodnick who have originally plan to run for comptroller this fall withdraw his_candidacy after scott m. stringer the manhattan borough president decide to drop his mayoral bid and run for comptroller instead
that may have earn mr. garodnick some good will with mr. stringer 's allies include representative jerrold nadler of manhattan 1_2 next_page

his surprising comment come in a lengthy interview in which he criticize the church for put dogma before love and for prioritize moral doctrine over serve the poor and marginalize
he articulate his vision of an inclusive church a home for all which be a striking contrast with his_predecessor pope benedict xvi the doctrinal defender who envision a small pure church
francis tell the interviewer a fellow jesuit it be not necessary to talk_about these issue all the time
the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church be not all equivalent
the church 's pastoral ministry can_not be obsess with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrine to be impose insistently
we have to find a new balance the pope continue otherwise even the moral edifice of the church be likely_to fall like a house of card lose the freshness and fragrance of the gospel
the pope 's interview do_not change church doctrine or policy but it instantly change its tone
his word evoke gratitude and hope from many liberal catholics who have feel leave out in the cold during the papacy of benedict and his_predecessor john paul ii which together last 35_year
some lapse catholics suggest on social_medium a return to the church and leader of gay_right and gay catholic group call on bishop to abandon their fight_against gay_marriage
but it leave conservative and traditionalist catholics and those_who have devote themselves to the struggle against abortion gay_marriage and artificial contraception on the defensive though some cast it as nothing new
nobody should try_to use the word of the pope to minimize the urgent need to preach and teach about abortion say the rev. frank pavone national director of priests for life who say he speak thursday about the priority of the abortion issue at a vatican conference
the interview with francis be conduct_by the rev. antonio spadaro editor in chief ofâ

the pope 's word be likely_to have repercussion in a church whose bishop and priest in many country include the united_states have often seem to make combat abortion gay_marriage and contraception their top public policy priority
francis say that those teaching have to be present in a large context
i see the church as a field hospital after battle francis say
it be useless to ask a seriously injure person if he have high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugar
you have to heal his wound
then we can talk_about everything_else

these excerpt be from the full interview publish in english by america magazine a jesuit weekly base in new_york
in his most extensive and revealing interview since he be elect in march pope_francis sit for a series of talk in_august with a fellow jesuit the rev. antonio spadaro the editor of the lead jesuit journal in rome
the pope formerly a cardinal jorge mario bergoglio speak of the mistake he feel he make when he become the superior of his jesuit province in argentina at the crazy young age of 36
he talk_about his vision of the church and why he have choose not to spend_much time talk_about abortion gay_marriage and contraception
he explain what he mean by the headline grab remark he make about gay people_who be i to judge
and he say that doubt be essential to find god
laurie goodstein who be jorge mario bergoglio
i be a sinner
this be the most accurate definition
it be not a figure of speech a literary genre
i be a sinner
why do you become a jesuit a member of the society of jesus
three thing in particular strike me about the society the missionary spirit community and discipline
and this be strange because i be a really really undisciplined person
but their discipline the way they manage their time these_thing strike me so_much
what do you learn in your early experience as superior of the jesuit province in argentina
my authoritarian and quick manner of make decision lead me to have serious problem and to be accuse of be ultraconservative
i live a time of great interior crisis when i be in cordova
to be sure i have never be like bless imelda but i have never be a right winger
it be my authoritarian way of make decision that create problem
what should the church say to divorce and remarry people and homosexual
in buenos aires i use to receive letter from homosexual person_who be socially wound because_they tell_me that they feel_like the church have always condemn them
but the church do_not want_to do this
during the return flight from rio de janeiro i say that if a homosexual person be of good will and be in search of god i be no_one to judge
by say this i say what the catechism say
religion have the right to express its opinion in the service of the people but god in creation have set us free it be not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person
a person once ask_me in a provocative manner if i approve of homosexuality
i reply with another question tell_me when god look_at a gay person do he endorse the existence of this person with love or reject and condemn this person
we_must always consider the person
what kind_of church do you dream of
we can_not insist only on issue relate to abortion gay_marriage and the use of contraceptive method
this be not possible
i have not speak much about these_thing and i be reprimand for that
but when we speak about these issue we have to talk_about them in a context
the teaching of the church for that matter be clear and i be a son of the church but it be not necessary to talk_about these issue all the time
the dogmatic and moral teaching of the church be not all equivalent
the church 's pastoral ministry can_not be obsess with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrine to be impose insistently
we have to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church be likely_to fall like a house of card lose the freshness and fragrance of the gospel
the proposal of the gospel must be more simple profound radiant
it be from this proposition that the moral consequence then flow
i say this also think_about the preaching and content of our preaching
what should be the role of the vatican 's various department or congregation
they be instrument of help
in some case however when they be not function well they run the risk of become institution of censorship
it be amazing to see the denunciation for lack of orthodoxy that come to rome
i_think the case should be investigate by the local bishop conference which can get valuable assistance from rome
these case in fact be much better deal_with locally
the roman congregation be mediator they be not middleman or manager
what should be the role of woman in the church
i be wary of a solution that can be reduce to a kind_of female machismo because a woman have a different makeup than a man
but what i hear about the role of woman be often inspire_by an ideology of machismo
woman be ask deep question that must be address
the church can_not be herself without the woman and her role
the woman be essential for the church
mary a woman be more important than the bishop
i say this because we_must not confuse the function with the dignity
we_must therefore investigate further the role of woman in the church
we have to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman
only by make this step will it be possible to better reflect on their function within the church
the feminine genius be need wherever we make important decision
the challenge today be this to think_about the specific place of woman also in those place_where the authority of the church be exercise for various area of the church
if encounter god be a journey then we can make mistake
if one have the answer to all the question that be the proof that god be not with him
it mean that he be a false prophet use religion for himself
the great leader of the people of god like moses have always leave room for doubt
you must leave room for the lord not for our certainty we_must be humble
our life be not give to us like an opera libretto in which all be write down but it mean go walk do search see
we_must enter into the adventure of the quest for meet god we_must let god search and encounter us
if the christian be a restorationist a legalist if he want everything clear and safe then he will find nothing
tradition and memory of the past must help us to have the courage to open up new area to god
those_who today always look for disciplinarian solution those_who long for an exaggerated doctrinal security those_who stubbornly try_to recover a past that no_longer exist they have a static and inward direct view of thing
in this way faith become an ideology among_other ideology
i have a dogmatic certainty god be in every person 's life
god be in everyone 's life
even_if the life of a person have be a disaster even_if it be destroy by vice drug or anything_else god be in this person 's life
you_can you must try_to seek god in every human life
although the life of a person be a land full of thorn and weed there be always a space in which the good seed can grow
you have to trust god
this interview with alan dabbiere chairman of airwatch a mobile device management company be conduct and condense by adam bryant
q. you have start or help build a couple of company
be that in your family 's dna
a. i do_not grow_up in an entrepreneurial family
i be head to medical_school and i do four_year of chemistry in college
my_father get sick and pass away my senior year
i do_not like the environment of be in a hospital
as a matter of fact i be probably plan on be a doctor more for him than for me because he want a doctor in the family
i end_up get an m.b.a. and work with a consult firm for four_year
but i find that as a consultant you be often tell where to be and when to be there
i like the nonstop travel for a while but i_want a little more control over my_life and more autonomy
i have meet some developer and we get together and decide to start a company
q.
what do you learn from that experience
a. after we start the company they call a meeting
in the way we structure the company i own 50_percent because i have the capital and i get the company up and run and they jointly own 50_percent
they say we do_not think that ' fair anymore
we_'re go to divide it equally and you_'re go down to 20_percent
i say i do_not think that ' what i be plan on
i do everything i could to talk them out of that but they be very resistant
i finally say look i have get a way that you_can have 100_percent of the company
i leave and i go out and find a new set of partner and do a complete restart
i set really clear expectation with my next set of partner
q.
and your next company be
a. manhattan associates
it take me about five_year to get to 30 people and then within three_year we be 800 people and we go public
i stay with them until they be well over 1,000 people and then i decide want_to do something new
q.
now you_'re the chairman of airwatch
what have you learn about culture from run two big company
a.
start a company be a bit like watch a murder mystery movie
the first_time you_'re just try_to figure_out how it end
the second time you_know how it end and you_'re actually focus_on the hint that the director be give you through the process
you_'re much_more focused on the style of the movie
q.
can you elaborate
a. with manhattan associates we be scale so quickly and we just keep hire people
we hire people_who be a little_bit too young
i find that it be easy for me to hire out of school and train the people i_want as oppose to the people_who be more set in their way
the problem be you_can not run 800 people with a bunch of very young employee
we have kid with one year of experience who be manage people with six_month of experience
there be a little_bit of internal chaos when you_'re grow that quickly because i would never do this before
q.
how be your leadership style evolve
a. i make every mistake you could possibly make
i be extremely autocratic
one of the reason we probably have a_lot of young_people be because i could tell young_people what to do and they would not question it
if_you bring in more senior people and tell them how to do their job they do_not like that very_much
i be not married and i have nothing else in my_life and i do_not have the view that anybody else have a life
why would you when you_'re have this much fun build a company like this
it really be not until after the i.p.o. that thing start to slow down a little_bit and we become more accept of different role different people and different way of managing
q.
so to use your metaphor you have have a chance to watch the movie a second time in your current role
tell_me about that
a. we have grow from 100 people to 1,500 people in the past three_year
you have get to build team that be organized
you have get to have different layer of management and skill set
you do_not just take a salesperson and make them a sale manager because those be completely different skill
we still hire a_lot of young_people out of school
we do a_lot of interview but we_'re extremely selective
people want_to be challenge in their interview
q.
so let_'s talk_about hire
how do the conversation go
a.
we ask how people feel about mobile
do they like it
how do they interact_with their device
we_want people_who be passionate about this
we ask them if_they feel lucky
we_want people to feel lucky because the harder you work the lucky you get
so people_who work hard actually feel lucky
and i make the statement that i_think there be three kind_of people in this world
with the first you ask them to do something and they can_not get it do
with the second type_of person if_you tell them what to do they will get the job do
there_' a third type_of person you point them in the right direction and they will figure it out
we_need that third type_of person
q.
what other question do you ask a. you ask them to tell story
give_me situation where you have do something creative
give_me situation where there be a problem that you need to solve
give_me a situation where you do_not have the leadership tell you what to do but you have to go fix a problem
and then you just let_them go from there
by ask really open ended question you get a good sense of not only how people answer_question but also how they think
and i almost always ask somebody to take something that ' complicated and that they know really really well and explain it to me
i do_not care what it be
can they put it in plain language and communicate it in clear and crisp and complete term
there_' just nothing more important than clear communication
be_able to take the complex and turn it into simple that ' what_we do for a living
it take a_lot of technology to create the illusion of simplicity

several_time in rush ron howard 's excitingly torqued movie set in the formula_one race world the camera get so close to a driver 's eye that you_can see each tremble lash
it_' a startlingly beautiful but also naked image partly_because there_' no hiding for an actor when the camera get that close
in moment like these you_'re no_longer watch a performance with its layer of art and technique you have cross the border between fiction and documentary to go eye to eye with another person 's nervous system
mr. howard do_not just want you to crawl inside a formula_one racecar he also want you to crawl inside its driver 's head
specifically he want_to get inside those of james hunt chris hemsworth and niki lauda daniel brã¼hl formula_one titan and rival who in 1976 help push the sport into mainstream consciousness
well at_least in much of the rest of the world formula_one have long struggle in the united_states
in 1976 when both man be in their late 20 they race after each_other while chase the world_championship over wet dry and terrifyingly gnarly track
tuck very_much alone into open wheel machine that could easily have become coffin hunt and lauda cut corner and graze death lap after lap whoosh over racetrack city street and deceptively pastoral road into the sort_of sport legend that translate only occasionally into good cinema
build for speed on and off the track hunt be the pretty one a tall blond british playboy who transcend his middle_class background to become racing royalty the king james of newspaper headline
bear into a wealthy austrian family the short slighter and dark lauda be by_contrast cruelly nickname the rat because of his pronounced overbite
the beaver would have be a more apt handle
hunt partied hard archival photograph inevitably show him bookended by woman his gaze nestle in their decolletage while lauda assume the role of the frosty teetotal tactician
they be an ideally match telegenic salable pair the heartthrob and the master gearhead whose difference in and out of their car put a playful at time anguish human face onto a sport story
it_' one that the screenwriter peter morgan strip down to its satisfying straightforward core
there be all sort_of narrative that could be spin out of formula_one include how life be sacrifice for profit
in 1994 ayrton senna become the last driver to die in a grand_prix
it_' hard to believe though that even a down and dirty expose would be a fraction as entertaining as rush which distill the thrill of race into a clash of personality one nail bite face off a catastrophic accident and a wild comeback
enzo ferrari the ferrari founder who be call the saturn or devourer of his child because of the fatality during his tenure may have be more important to formula_one than any driver but romance like rush do_not belong_to the owner they belong_to the worker the grim one and the smile one the one with the death wish and the one with the gusher of champagne
shortly_after the movie open hunt be walk barefoot into a hospital bleed from the nose while still in his racing suit
he ' a ravishing mess and his effect on the room which go immediately silent be unmistakably erotic
hunt james hunt he announce echo a familiar line
before long a nurse be at once dress his wound and undress the rest of him a seduction that ' as much about the audience 's pleasure as that of the character on screen
best_know for play the comic_book hero thor mr. hemsworth be pretty than the all too real man he play in rush
yet this surplus of beauty work for the role because the actor who hold the screen with the unconscious physical confidence of the truly lovely look_like the star that james hunt become
the scene of hunt sauntering into a hospital also signal that for all the machine and money rush be a human story about body if one almost always in furious motion
it_' also about work about find a drive as they say in racing and keep it even after machine and people spectacularly fail
lauda who ' see buy his way into race with loan his_family do_not support his passion be not a natural physical specimen or showman like hunt
yet one of the movie 's deepen pleasure be how as the story slyly shift from one man to the other it peel back the arrogance encase lauda who ' so abrasive that it_' hard not to root against_him even as mr. brã¼hl 's dexterous textured performance pull you close
london the song arrive late in the new musical charlie and the chocolate factory but when that familiar lilting melody begin audience come alive as at no other point in the show
during one performance this_summer several people hum softly while others smile broadly as the mysterious chocolatier willy wonka step into his glass elevator and sing pure imagination the immensely tuneful number from the 1971 film willy wonka the chocolate factory
the show 's director sam mendes fear this would happen
he resist include pure imagination at first say he already feel haunt by the performance of gene wilder as wonka from the movie
he do_not want his musical 's otherwise original score to be size up against the most beloved song from the movie
but now it be pure imagination more durable than an everlasting gobstopper that_is haunt the $_20 million musical
the show may well end_up be remember as a cautionary tale for movie studio who want_to make musical out of film and book in this case by roald dahl that be treasure by many
it_' a song you_can not get out of your head say an audience member david reid of inverness scotland as he and his 12-year old_son matthew stand outside the drury lane theater after the show
it_' quite hard to improve on that movie be not it
charlie the late theatrical effort by hollywood studio to cash in on movie property be face an uphill climb toward a major goal of its producer at warner_brothers become a hit on broadway
the world premiere open here to sharply mixed review this_summer include some harsh one a hindrance to any future broadway transfer let alone eventual profitability here or in new_york or from road and international production that may follow
more damning than anything some critic declare that the most resonant song in the musical be not one of the 18 original number by the tony award winner marc shaiman and scott wittman hairspray but pure imagination the only tune import from the wilder movie
while mr. mendes 's musical have much else that be new a plot twist involve wonka play by the tony winner douglas hodge la cage aux folles for_instance and an updating of charlie and the other four child with golden ticket the show nevertheless find itself struggle to compete_with a ghost
i find it pretty difficult to un remember gene wilder while i be work on this but ideally people have to put aside the movie say mr. mendes himself the oscar win film director of american beauty and whose last picture be the james bond blockbuster skyfall
look we have see visual rendition of world on film that you be never go to get in theater the yellow brick road will only go to the back wall of the theater and wonka 's river of chocolate can never be match onstage mr. mendes add
you have to find magical solution to theatrical challenge and hope that the audience be open to them
no_one be hop more_than the show 's lead producer from warner_brothers mark kaufman and raymond wu who take_over the theatrical division in_2011 as part_of a shake up after its broadway musical flop baby it_' you and lestat
the two man be bullish during a recent_interview use their_own superlative to describe the london production of charlie but they also say that the musical would be retool for broadway
a new_york transfer have not be announce while the 2014 15 theater season be think to be the target the two man decline to say when it would happen
another musical base_on a dahl book matilda be now run in london and on broadway it have have strong review and solid ticket sale in both market
the charlie producer say they be confident_that matilda would not swamp them
every show and everyone deserve a second chance mr. kaufman say
plenty_of show get review that be not favorable the first_time out
our word of mouth be good and we_'re play at 95_percent capacity which be a very_good sign
several broadway producer who have come here to see charlie be lukewarm about its script and score and say they would not want_to invest in any broadway transfer of the show
the producer would only disclose their reservation anonymously for fear of offend the artist involve
none have any easy solution to the show 's flaw but posit two idea
lack excellent review the show need to build into a box office sensation to justify a transfer to new_york
and the producer could add more popular tune from the wilder film like the candy man or the oompa loompa song that accompany the little orange skinned man_who work in the factory
but the warner_brothers executive who have hear these suggestion wo_not go there 1_2 next_page

mr._fischer who grow_up on a farm here and have have a job since he be 9 look as if he grow_up on a farm here and have have a job since he be 9
his dark weather skin wrinkly eye gray beard and crack callous hand belie a mere 33 year

this pocket of martha 's vineyard actually the western side of the island revolve_around chilmark and menemsha
it_' where resort give way to pasture and farmland and wildlife
it_' where you find century old farm run by 28-year old as_well as lithe woman whom you may mistake for model or actress in new_york or los_angeles pick kale on bucolic 10-acre plot

tom delay be the very symbol of congressional power and in the view of his detractor excess
his political career collapse in 2005 when mr._delay a texas republican who be the house majority_leader be indict on money laundering charge that result in a three_year prison sentence
but mr._delay 's long and colorful life take another turn on_thursday as a texas appeal_court throw out the november 2010 verdict rule that what he be convict of laundering corporate contribution to divert money to elect republicans to the state_legislature do_not violate any state law
mr._delay as it turn_out be in washington at a luncheon with his former republican colleague when the decision be announce
the former congressman know as the hammer for a political style that embrace hard edge political tactic and a relationship_with washington lobbyist that invite scrutiny from prosecutor be nothing short of jubilant praise god and belittle democrats and prosecutor for make such an effort to go after him
i just thank the lord for carry me through all of this mr._delay tell_reporter as he leave a meeting of the texas republican delegation
it really drive my detractor crazy because i have the joy of jesus in me and they do_not understand it the decision by the third court of appeals which vote 2 to 1 on party line be the late time that a high_profile prosecution of an elect official invoke unusual legal theory have be stymie by an appeal_court or stumble in the legal process
others who avoid conviction or have them overturn include former_senator john edwards of north_carolina and former_senator ted stevens of alaska
from the start many republicans have denounce this prosecution as politically motivate overreach
still give the long list of ethical question that have cloud mr._delay 's career the former congressman say he have spend nearly $_12 million on legal bill fend off everything from the congressional ethic committee to the department of justice the decision appear to fall_short of a complete ethical cleansing
when he step_down as majority_leader in 2005 and later decide not to seek re_election from his district in sugarland mr._delay now 66 face not only the indictment in texas but also an investigation by the department of justice into his relationship_with jack abramoff a lobbyist at the heart of an ethic investigation
the justice_department never bring charge_against mr._delay for among_other thing accept gift from mr. abramoff like a 10-day golf trip to scotland and england for mr._delay his_wife and some staff_member
mr._delay 's lawyer brian w. wice say that the investigation have ruin his life in large_part but that mr._delay view the decision as a vindication a chance to restart his career
now that this sword of damocles have be remove i would think he could do almost anything he want_to do he say
mr._delay have be free on a $_10,000 bond
he have be anything but low profile deliver speech offer consulting advice write a blog and in a career turn that may have eclipse his work in washington appear on dance with the stars while wear a vest with leopard trim
they never get_rid of me mr._delay say
you may see my shadow or footprint around over the last seven_year
i have be active
mr._delay be convict with two associate of funnel $ 190,000 in corporate contribution through the republican national committee to republicans run for the state_legislature in 2002
the election have national implication mr._delay be look to lock in republican control of the legislature as it prepare to redraw congressional district line
and after that election republicans in texas push through a redistricting plan that markedly change the playing field in favor of republicans strengthen mr._delay 's control in washington
this be the first_time that prosecutor in texas have attempt_to use a money laundering statute against a politician charge with try_to circumvent the state ban on corporate contribution that have be in place since_2003
mr._delay never deny he engage_in the practice describe in the indictment but say they be common and legally accept campaign practice
in its decision the court flatly reject the case bring against_him
the evidence be legally insufficient to support delay 's conviction justice melissa goodwin write for the majority
the fundamental problem with the state 's case be its failure to prove proceeds of criminal activity
the travis county district_attorney 's_office say it be consider whether to appeal to the full texas court of criminal appeals
we be concerned and disappointed that two judge substitute their assessment of the fact for that of 12 juror who personally hear the testimony of over 40 witness over the course of several week and find that the evidence be sufficient and prove delay 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the office say
mr. wice who describe himself as a close_friend and a consigliere to mr._delay i_'ve be do this for 30 year and you_want to win them all but i never want_to win one more_than this one say that he do_not expect the appeal_court to overturn the decision and that he think it unlikely they would even take it up
i_'ve clerk at that court i have follow it since the truman administration he say
i be confident_that they be not go to look_at the case
you do_not need to be a legal genius to see that the money laundering statute do_not apply here
as he talk to reporter mr._delay trace his problem back to 1995 when the democratic congressional campaign committee begin file ethic charge_against him
i have raise and spend on legal fee over that period over $_12 million he say
but that ' what they want_to do they want_to destroy me

milan the paint face star down from the wall in ecstasy anger sadness all woman of course for these be mural by artist from jeanne detallante 's beauty masks to gabriel specter 's colourful women
and this be a show by miuccia prada
i_want to do such beautiful dress but i_want to express the fight that have to be very visible say ms. prada backstage
i struggle to do it
i personally love it
and i try_to make it interesting at_least from my point of view
interest the dress be colorful and extraordinary illuminate not just by the bold face print digitally over the low body of a wool or fur coat but also smother in sequin especially rhinestone brassiere build in at the bosom
with the vivid green red yellow and blue color the knee high sporty leg warmer and sometimes colored feather in the hair the effect be tribal
but there be also an_unexpected feeling of the 1980 and those vivienne westwood external bra inspire_by african woman
but ms. prada make everything her_own
instead of the ugly aesthetic for which she be famed these clothes be weirdly beautiful
the vast head on the clothes or handbag seem to shout the story of this current decade look_at me
it_' all about me
no other designer capture quite so forcefully in fashion the current female mind
the name myllokunmingia may not ring a bell but it be worth know
this 520-million year old creature be the size of a guppy with a tiny swordfish like fin run high over its back
the fossil it have leave_behind preserve trace of a skull
human have a skull too
this and a number of other trait we share with myllokunmingia reveal it to be one of the old most primitive vertebrate yet find
it be in other_word a hint of where we come from
myllokunmingia emerge during one of the most_important phase in the history of life an evolutionary boom know as the cambrian_explosion name for the geological period when it take_place
over the course of about 20_million year the old know fossil of most of the major group of live animal appear reveal a rapid diversification of life that lead directly to human
it_' rapid in geological term but it_' probably not rapid to anyone_who ' not a geologist say paul smith the director of the oxford museum of natural history
by some estimate the first animal evolve about 750 million year_ago
but it_' not until around 520 million year_ago that many major group of live animal leave_behind their first fossil
for decade scientist have search_for the trigger that set in motion this riot of diversity in the animal kingdom
recently dr._smith and his colleague david harper of the university of durham take a look_at the hypothesis that have be offer about what cause the cambrian_explosion
it become apparent just how_many hypothesis there be out there dr._harper say
thirty plus over the past 10_year
the scientist find that many of those explanation have boil the cause down to just one trigger
geologist suggest geological cause
ecologist propose ecological one
many of those idea have merit dr._smith and dr._harper argue in a commentary in this_week 's science but it_' a mistake to search_for a single cause
they propose that a tangle web of factor and feedback be responsible_for evolution 's big bang
long before the cambrian_explosion dr._smith and dr._harper argue one lineage of animal have_already evolve the genetic capacity for spectacular diversity
know as the bilaterians they probably look_at first like little crawl worm
they share the precambrian ocean with other animal like sponge and jellyfish
during the cambrian_explosion relatively mod change to their gene give rise to a spectacular range of body
but those gene evolve in bilaterians ten of million of year before the cambrian_explosion put them to the test note dr._smith
they have the capacity he say but it have not be express yet
it take a global flood to tap that capacity dr._smith and dr._harper propose
they base their proposal on a study publish last_year by shanan peters of the university of wisconsin and robert gaines of pomona college
they offer evidence_that the cambrian_explosion be precede by a rise in sea_level that submerge vast swath of land erode the drown rock
there_' a big kick that correlate with the sea_level rise dr._smith say of the fossil record
he and dr._harper propose that this kick happen thanks to the new habitat create by the sea_level rise
these shallow coastal habitat be bath in sunlight and nourish with erode nutrient like phosphate
animal colonize these new fertile habitat dr._smith and dr._harper argue and evolve to take up new ecological niche
but these great flood also poison the ocean
the erosion of the coastline release calcium which can be toxic to cell
in order to survive animal have to evolve way to rid themselves of the poison
one solution may have be to pack the calcium into crystal which eventually evolve_into shell bone and other hard tissue
dr._smith do_not think it_' a coincidence that several different lineage of bilaterians evolve hard tissue during the cambrian_explosion and not sooner
these shell and other hard tissue speed_up animal evolution even more
predator could grow hard claw and jaw for kill prey and their prey could evolve hard shell and spine to defend themselves
animal become lock in an evolutionary arm race
this new ecological food web grow even more complex
big predator evolve that could eat small predator
meanwhile some bilaterians burrow into the sea floor for the first_time allow oxygen rich seawater to flow into the sediment
those first burrowers profoundly transform the world 's ocean create yet_another habitat that other oxygen breathe animal could also invade
that drive the diversification onward say dr._smith
kevin peterson a biologist at dartmouth praise dr._smith and dr._harper for point to the right way to study the cambrian_explosion
we be long past identify single trigger for the event he say
dr. peters agree that take a holistic view of the cambrian_explosion would lead to a better understanding_of it
it 'll be a fun next decade he predict
but philip donoghue of the university of bristol do_not think the link dr._smith and dr._harper use in their hypothesis be tight enough yet
question still remain for_example about how long vertebrate and other animal group already exist before they leave_behind fossil like myllokunmingia
if animal diversify earlier then scientist will need to look_at earlier cause
timing say dr. donoghue be everything
in finding that be as scientifically significant as they be crush to the popular imagination nasa report thursday that its mars rover curiosity have deflate hope that life could be thrive on_mars today
the conclusion publish in the journal science come from the fact_that curiosity have be look for methane a ga that be consider a possible calling card of microbe and have so_far find none of it
while the absence of methane do_not rule out the possibility of present day life on_mars there be plenty_of microbe on_earth at_least that do_not produce methane it do return the idea to the realm of pure speculation without_any hopeful data to back it up
the history of human fascination with the possibility of life on_mars be rich encompass myriad work of science fiction percival lowell 's quixotic effort to map what turn_out to be imaginary canal orson welles 's panic induce 1938 war of the worlds radio play and of course bugs bunny 's nemesis marvin the martian
but marvin apparently do_not emit enough methane for curiosity 's sensitive instrument to find him
you do_not have direct evidence_that there be microbial process go on say sushil k. atreya a professor of atmospheric and space science at the university of michigan and a member of the science team
but nasa scientist be go strictly by their data and they be leery about draw broad implication to the question once pose by david bowie
be there life on_mars
john p. grotzinger the project scientist for the curiosity mission would go only so_far as to say that the lack of this ga do diminish the possibility of methane exhaling creature go about their business on_mars
it would have be great if we get methane dr. atreya say
it just be not there
curiosity which have be trundle across the planet for a little over a year make measurement from martian spring to late summer come_up empty for methane
scientist have long think that mars warm and wet in its early year could have be hospitable for life and the new finding do_not mean that it be not
but that be about three and a half billion year_ago
methane molecule break apart over a few century victim of the sun 's ultraviolet light and of chemical reaction in the atmosphere so any methane in the air from primordial time would have disappear long_ago
that be why report of huge plume of methane rise over mars in 2003 fuel fresh hope for martian microbe
those finding base_on data from telescope on_earth and a spacecraft orbit mars set_off a surge of speculation and scientific interest
on_earth most of the methane come from micro organism know as methanogen but the ga be also produce without live organism in hydrothermal vent
either possibility would be a surprising result for mars
after the 2003 methane reading a_lot people get excite and start work on it say christopher r. webster of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif. and the lead author of the paper in science
it be a very_important result because of the magnitude of methane
the fresh data from curiosity bring the earlier claim into question
not everyone be daunt
robert zubrin president of the mars society a nonprofit group dedicate to the planet 's exploration and settlement say he be still convinced that martian life be wait to be discover in underground aquifer
if it have find methane that would have be killer dr. zubrin say refer_to curiosity
yes it_' disappointing in that we do_not get a pony for christmas
but it do_not mean there be not pony out there
one of the scientist who find the methane plume in 2003 michael_j. mumma of nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt md. say in an_interview this_week he be certain that his earlier measurement be still valid
he say he now believe_that methane on_mars be episodic release in large plume and then quickly destroy
he suggest half jokingly that there could be huge colony of methane eat microbe on_mars that eliminate the ga from the air
dr. mumma acknowledge_that he could_not identify any phenomenon that would explain_why methane plume spurt out that year but not more recently or how methane could be destroy much_more quickly on_mars than on_earth
mars may not be operate the same_way he say
it_' a puzzle

in a way you have to forgive people of a certain age the writer david sedaris say recently
like when you watch the movie into the wild
there be time when i just want_to take that kid and shake him but then i_think he ' 20
that ' what 20-year old do and you just have to forgive him that
in 1997 mr._sedaris recall his_own youthful hubris in c.o.g. an essay in his collection naked in which he describe a post collegiate steinbeck inspire pilgrimage to the hood river valley in oregon to yank apple off tree and learn a little something about fortitude
it_' a smart drolly tell come of age story both mocking and indulgent of its narrator 's unearned righteousness of all the humiliation that accompany self discovery
with hope of acquire the film right to c.o.g. the writer and director kyle patrick alvarez attend one of mr._sedaris 's reading stand in line to meet him and then hand over a dvd of his first film easy with practice
i just put it in my bag mr._sedaris say
then i finish my tour and get back to england and think oh right this to tell you the truth i get a_lot of thing like that
but i_think well i will give it a try
and i just really really like it
i_think it be such a unique and strangely beautiful little movie
he eventually say yes to mr. alvarez
c.o.g. which be release on_friday by screen media and focus world be the first film adaptation of his work
mr. alvarez write the script
i do_not at any moment think be i say yes to the wrong person mr._sedaris say
and when it come to movie he know a thing or two there be stretch he say when he go to see film as often as three time a week and repeat viewing sometimes dozen be not uncommon
on the phone from his home in england mr._sedaris speak about some of the film he ' watch the most
the only thing i ever walk_out of be dr. doolittle with eddie murphy he say
it_' remarkable what i will sit through it really be
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_29 2013because of an_editing error_an article last_sunday about the favorite film of the writer david sedaris misidentified the child actor show with dylan baker in an accompanying picture from the todd solondz film happiness
he be evan silverberg not justin elvin
the article also misidentified the distributor of c.o.g. a new film base_on an essay by mr._sedaris
it be be release by screen media and focus world not by forty

milan high rise building in milan their metallic frame and glass window wink with the september sun have bring a new futuristic feeling to this city
the porta nuova business district be not just home this_week to a financial initiative by the conde nast group to support artistic italian student
it have also be a fresh venue for forward look designer
across the spectrum of the italian spring/summer 2014 season be a yearning for modernity
however deep the heritage of a brand lead designer be look for the future not the past in style and technique
the main message from these early show be let there be light
that be the story at fendi where backstage silvia venturini fendi announce light be an inspiration before take a joint bow with karl lagerfeld in his 48th year at the helm of the brand
the show start with a gust of lightness dress in red organza the skirt blow out
the same material would appear later with cutout of shear mink add to the collection 's graphic modern feel
for all its ethereal effect the show be also rich in the famous fendi fur delicately use as light as feather tease into animal shape bag dangle as earring below the model japanese square cut hair and as fur ring embed with crystal
these accessory be from the new family fashion recruit the jeweler delfina delettrez fendi
the recent trajectory of fendi have be to a streamlined modernity and mr. lagerfeld achieve that by use the exceptional work of the couture fur atelier
with a new store opening this_week on via montenapoleone and an exhibition in a historic cinema of fendi fur in film the brand be on a roll
maxmara have always be a no nonsense brand with a focus_on coat but there be something almost monkish about the ultra plain finely cut outerwear over midcalf dress
both be in pallid neutral color although enrich with texture
this parade of plainness cover up poncho coat include go on to a fault until there be an injection of the same look in vivid color fuchsia purple orange and red
maxmara do a real service to woman make such clean clear well cut clothes
but an exploration of more subtle color like terra cotta blush pink and rain wash sky blue would have give a tinge of glamour
ennio capasa bring his costume national woman 's collection back from paris to his native italy
and it be to what the designer call a new milan the concrete basement of a soar glass and steel skyscraper
the switch of showplace and space inspire mr. capasa to take a fresh look_at deconstruction and reassembly
so the collection have sharp tailoring and high_tech material mix with craft tunic set at an angle tailoring apparently in weave linen contrast with a silvered finish suit to the skeleton of the hyper modern building
all the current minimalism in milan have a hint of celine today and of helmut lang from the past
but take a modern and streamlined route be an_important move for designer in this city
to see the yin and yang in milanese design there be alberta ferretti turn to that perennial gift of summer flower
but her floral pattern have a touch of folklore as though peasant girl have cross stitch embroidery on white cotton
the south of italy meet south america say ms. ferretti backstage to explain the hot orange bougainvillea pink and ocean blue that punctuate the collection
the effect be pretty and girlish with dress that will attract loyal client who want_to look feminine rather_than feminist
but like those folkloric dance for the tourist this vision of local culture go on too long
with a galaxy of explosion as a backdrop and blownup image of nature on the perky summer clothes the just cavalli range be rich in digital pattern
the concept of animal skin with vegetable and floral pattern if not new make a fine splash of color and print
but why do roberto cavalli have to communicate this message by sexting the word for those suggestive image send via smartphones across cyberspace
mr. cavalli 's sexy message be clear from the first visible bra albeit with pretty print that fill an open front outfit
the theme go on with cut away curve on a summer dress reveal flesh at the side crop top bar the midriff and many more take on the visible brassiere
the just cavalli message seem to be welcome to the world of sea sand and yacht
and why not
but apart_from some patterned pant and a few narrow strap dress these outfit seem too hot to handle in the workplace
with shoe so often center stage at the current show the shoe brand hogan have want_to identify its clothing range
the total look as envisage by ã¼ber stylist katie grand be more tailor than usual and the foot of the model lounge in chair even have high heeled pump to compete_with chunky boot
the trim leather jacket be an inspiration from the past
i_think of a leather jacket my_father loan me that i use to wear in the 1970
i take away the zipper and replace it with button say ms. grand who always make anything historic look immediately modern

marshawn lynch offer fantasy owner a valuable early lesson in week 2
despite face the dread san_francisco 49er run defense lynch score three touchdown two rush rewarding owner who be brave enough to stick with him
it be a good reminder that sometimes fantasy owner can overthink the matchup and end_up bench a player they draft in the first_round
in general we preach that you should start the team you draft especially in the first few_week of the season and that player who have unfavorable matchup should not be bench if_they be of a certain caliber
lynch owner have it easy this_week as he be up against the jacksonville jaguars
he be among our favorable matchup pick for week 3
if_you have a tough lineup question for week 3 you_can ask us on_twitter
follow us at @5thdownfantasy
favorable matchup quarterback tony romo dal vs. st._louis
the rams secondary be off to a poor start allow an average of 350 yard pass and four total touchdown through the first two game
russell wilson sea vs. jacksonville
the jaguar have allow just 15 fantasy_point per_game to the position through the first two week but we be not buy that they have improve much consider they face alex smith and terrelle pryor
matthew stafford det vs. washington the redskins problematic secondary have be ransack for 72 fantasy_point this_season which be top in the league
stafford be a must start top five quarterback in week 3
ryan tannehill mia vs. atlanta the dolphins appear to have finally figure_out a way to deploy their pricey new receiver mike wallace 9 rec
115 yds wk 2 and tannehill be start to show a nice rapport with tight_end charles clay
a meeting with the falcons bang up defense be on deck
alex smith kc vs. philadelphia smith get a foul eagles secondary that make philip rivers 419 yard 76.7 percent completion rate 3 tds look_like aaron rodgers last_week
but smith be still the check down king rank 30th in the league in yard_per pas attempt 5.66 which keep his upside ground in mid qb2 territory for week 3
run_back reggie bush and joique bell det vs. washington bush 's availability for sunday be up in the air but if_you handcuff him with bell you will be fine
whoever get the start should have a field day against a terrible redskins run defense that make the mediocre james starks 158 total yard 1 td one of the most_popular waiver wire add this_week
marshawn lynch sea vs. jacksonville you may have bench lynch against the dominant 49er defense only to be burn when he score three touchdown but he should be consider a top two fantasy run_back this_week in a dream matchup with the jaguars 31st rank run defense
frank gore sf vs. indianapolis gore be off to a slow start but he be finally get a favorable matchup against a colts unit that have cough up thee rush tds and four and a half yard_per carry to the position this_season
alfred morris was vs. detroit despite be limit to a 12-carry average the last two week be on the losing end of two big blowout morris have be_able to remain useful with a 10.5 fantasy_point average

knowshon moreno den vs. oakland
it seem strange refer_to the raiders as a favorable matchup this_week as they have give_up just 6 fantasy_point per_game to oppose run_back so_far but take a look_at the competition vick ballard and a struggle jaguars ground game
moreno will lead the mile high committee in snap for a third consecutive week and be an rb2/flex option this_weekend
wide_receiver mike wallace mia vs. atlanta wallace be free from his usual vertical downfield role last_weekend which result in great number versus the colts
pray to the fantasy god that this trend continue and keep him active against a wound falcons defense that be yield the fourth most point to the position
dwayne bowe kc vs. philadelphia sure the matchup be drool induce 40 fppg allow 1st wr but smith 's reluctance to toss it downfield have limit bowe 's fantasy potential so keep expectation in check
reggie wayne ind vs. san_francisco while the surprise wednesday addition of trent richardson further reinforce the notion that the colts want_to emphasize the ground game this_season the typically tough 49er run defense contain running back to 3.6 yard_per carry

be you the person that we can ask question
or be you just a guard
if the visitor 's word sting jeffrey martinez he do_not show it
after a summer protecting work by the artist james turrell at the guggenheim museum he have grow accustomed to rove throng of the baffle
fielding question be not his job as a guard but the questioner do_not know that
they 'll come and say what ' go on
what be this?'â he say
and they will either shrug and move on or stay and be interested
the dark secret of this acclaimed show which close on_wednesday be that it have mystify a_lot of people whether or not they admit it
many do_not understand_what mr. turrell 's quadrilateral of light project onto dark background be about and why this show be such an art event
you see it in the visitor eye search the room for the likewise perplex
some spot a guard like mr._martinez sidle up with question
he always answer base_on his_own reading and on insight forage from his colleague
it be not the first_time i would see guard at this exhibition which be short on explanatory label do the same
they be after all the only thing stand between many visitor and incomprehension or in the case of at_least one regretful musing about the number of beer he could have have for the price of admission
if_they 're_go to pay $ 22 to get in they may as_well know_what it be mr._martinez say
but he bring to his brief and mod answer empathy not just for the visitor but also for the artist
after all he too be an artist a lifelong painter who know that his_own work be unlikely ever to require guard but who have live for art all the same
tall and thick as a linebacker with eye that swell in conversation and just a dusting of buzz cut hair mr._martinez 47 be stand on a recent tuesday in the museum 's high gallery beside a turrell work title ronin a vertical corridor of light whose depth and source be its alluring mystery
one by one the visitor come saw become confused and very often seek the guard 's guidance
an elderly man_who wish to be identify only as martin walk in and fail to notice the illuminate strip point instead toward an_empty wall ask be this part_of the exhibit
mr._martinez redirect the man 's eye toward the light and martin walk off to stand before it dutifully commune
this one i do_not get he mumble
martin be there he say because of a friend who get on his nerve
the friend always find everything great wonderful amazing
martin thus avoid whatever the friend praise
the friend dislike the turrell show which make martin think this one must be good
now martin walk back to mr._martinez
so it_' an opening
he ask wonder where the light be come from
reassure that it be martin now declare that he would understand all along my perception be not usually that clear but it be immediately_clear that it be a hole in the wall he say
not everyone need to understand
i be not try_to get it i be try_to experience it say carol hoffman 73 a mix medium artist from princeton n.j.
for her share bafflement be the point we_'re with all_these other people try_to figure it out
the 4_p.m. rotation come and mr._martinez move to another room
he watch adult make shadow puppet in the project light of another turrell piece
a frenchwoman stroll past put a spin on the exhibition as trã¨ trã¨ trã¨s minimaliste
three chilean woman approach mr._martinez and in spanish ask the significaciã³n of a work that look a_lot like someone have turn on a home projector without fire up the laptop
mr._martinez be careful to begin there_' no specific meaning but my_own interpretation be he offer his standard turrell spiel this particular artist 's method be to play with your perception
no_one want_to be the person_who do_not understand and a moment later one of the woman declare herself enthralled beautiful precious very exciting
she_say
mr._martinez cherish these occasion to rescue a bad encounter with art

tokyo hiroshi yamauchi who transform his great grandfather 's playing card company nintendo into a global video_game powerhouse die on_thursday in kyoto japan
he be 85
the cause be complication of pneumonia the company say
mr._yamauchi who lead nintendo from 1949 to 2002 be japan 's most unlikely high_tech success story
name president of the family business at 22 he steer nintendo into board game light emit toy gun and baseball pitching machine fruitless foray that he later attribute to a lack of imagination before the company arrive_at arcade game
its donkey kong and the original mario bros. become hit and give rise to nintendo 's wildly successful home video_game business
the nintendo entertainment system a console first release in japan in 1983 as famicom unseat early leader in the video_game industry sell more_than 60 million unit thanks to shrewd marketing close attention to product quality and a crop of game base_on unlikely yet endearing character that soon become household name
in 1988 the new_york times write many nintendo best seller like super mario bros. 2 be base_on wildly preposterous premise note_that the two mustachioed hero of that game endure various trial such as dodge hammer swing turtle and lava ball and man eat plant in order to save a mushroom princess
but the article conclude no_matter
kid can_not get enough of the game
under mr._yamauchi who profess not to understand video_game nintendo go on to dominate the business
when a successor machine be release in 1990 fan camp outside electronics store for day in anticipation it sell almost 50 million unit
next come the nintendo 64 and nintendo game cube home console as_well as game boy hand hold machine
nintendo dominate the list of all time top sell game
in the early 1990 mr._yamauchi find_himself in the middle of an international dispute when he offer to buy a majority stake in the seattle mariners
the team establish in 1977 have be threaten to leave seattle if it could_not find a new owner willing_to keep it there
nintendo have its united_states headquarters in seattle
the team 's owner approve the deal but the commissioner of major_league baseball fay vincent and a four man m.l.b. owner committee initially oppose it
they relent and approve the sale in 1992 after mariners fan and the seattle news_medium rally in favor of it
in 2001 the mariners sign the star japanese outfielder ichiro suzuki now with the yankees help to open the door for many more japanese player to join major_league team in the united_states
in a show of his characteristic detachment however mr._yamauchi confess at the time that he be not much interested_in baseball either
he say he have never go to a baseball game and be think to have never go since
one of his few hobby be the japanese board game go which he play at the master 's level
hiroshi yamauchi be bear in kyoto on_nov. 7 1927
he be raise by his grandparent after his_father shikanojo yamauchi desert the family
the yamauchis have be maker of hanafuda card a japanese playing card game base_on flower since 1889
once favor by the elite it become popular as a gambling game often play by japanese gangster
mr._yamauchi join the family business in 1949 after his grandfather have a stroke
he move quickly to take control at the company force out a cousin and later purge officer appoint by his grandfather
but the playing card business be in terminal decline and mr._yamauchi shift the company 's focus to one toy after another until he find success with video_game in the 1980
he be help by the renowned video_game designer shigeru miyamoto who join the company in 1977 and create mario donkey kong the legend of zelda wii and other product
mr._yamauchi develop a strategy that set him apart_from other consumer electronics manufacturer in japan
from early on he farm out the production of nintendo 's video_game machine to small supplier allow the company to maintain a relatively_small staff and low overhead cost
nintendo approve only a handful_of game each year whether design internally or by outside company ensure_that price and profit margin remain high
there be some misfire under mr._yamauchi 's watch
the company 's cumbersome headache induce virtual boy portable console a red box on leg with rubber visor that player peer into to play game in 3-d be a flop

a text_message send to journalist from a taliban official claim that the insurgent have kill 25 policeman and capture 12
but on_thursday the spokesman_for the afghan interior ministry sediq seddiqi dispute both the insurgent claim and those of the warduj governor say no police_officer have be capture
the dispute report be symptomatic both of an increase casualty rate among afghan force and grow government sensitivity about such information
last_year afghan official report that afghan national army soldier be be kill at the rate of more_than three a day while death of police_officer be about six a day twice as high
by comparison coalition casualty have never reach two a day and be now few than one a day
while hard figure be scarce this_year a number of public_comment have suggest a significant increase in casualty on the government side
this_month the newspaper the guardian quote gen. joseph f. dunford jr. the american_military commander as say that afghan force be lose 100 a week
i_'m not assume that those casualty be sustainable general dunford be report to have say
if that trend continue it would represent a substantial increase over last_year 's report 2,970 death for afghan security_force include both police_officer and soldier
on july 22 the interior minister gen. ghulam mujtaba patang address parliament during impeachment proceeding against_him defend himself by say he have be preoccupy with the rise death_toll

mr. seddiqi say thursday that casualty figure have not yet be compile nationwide so he be not able_to give number
i can say there have be a slight increase in the number of casualty he say
he attribute that to afghan authorities take on great responsibility as nato and the americans have less of a combat role run more operation and more aggressive one and prepare_for election next_year by try_to improve security condition
i can_not give you the exact percentage of that increase but it be slight he say
in wednesday 's episode mr. seddiqi insist_that no policeman have be take prisoner in warduj district in badakhshan province
mr. seddiqi say the authorities there have be conduct an operation to clear taliban fighter from the area and have kill 47 insurgent in the district

so_far we have clear 90_percent of the district of the taliban 's presence he say
warduj district be also where the taliban kill one afghan soldier and capture 22 others in an ambush in march
after negotiation with tribal elder in the area six of the soldier be release unhurt but 16 others be kill by the insurgent
warduj district lie along the highway lead into the wakhan corridor an area of very high mountain border by china and pakistan
until this_year badakhshan be one of the quiet area in afghanistan
the district governor do_not have information_about what be really go on in warduj district mr. seddiqi say
he be not in there how could he know governor mohammad speak by_telephone from his office in the district government building say that 10 body of policeman kill in the attack have_already be deliver to the district police headquarters nearby
the taliban behead two of the capture police and they be threaten to behead all the others the governor say
his account be partially confirm by the provincial police chief in badakhshan imam udin mutmaeen who say that nine policeman have be kill in the ambush on_wednesday and that an unspecified number be missing
in_addition to a general rise in casualty attack in which large_number of afghan_government force be kill have become increasingly common
when american troop be more involved it be rare for an attack to kill more_than a few soldier at_least in part_because of air support which afghan force do_not usually get on their_own
in_april for_instance taliban insurgent overrun an outpost in kunar province kill all 13 afghan soldier there
in may afghan force beat back a taliban offensive in the strategic sangin district of helmand province but lose 19 soldier and policeman in the fight

nbc will feature one of its icon johnny carson in an_ambitious biopic mini series the network announce on_thursday
the timing of the special be not announce nor the crucial decision on who will play carson

as dexter reach its final episode on showtime on_sunday night the question be will he go or will he go
that be will the serial killer dexter morgan head off to happy retirement in argentina with his_family or end_up in some kind_of hell whether above or below ground
do the man we have watch plunge long knife into helpless victim for eight season require punishment no_matter how charming and sometimes heroic he ' be
the proper fate of the seemingly irredeemable hero be a hot topic in prime_time right_now with break_bad play out a similar scenario in its fifth and final_season which end on_sept. 29
of course history tell_us that these accounting can be ambiguous tony soprano freeze in his booth at the diner vic mackey consign to a desk job but reach for his gun
those finale of the sopranos and the shield suggest_that dramatic value and the feeling of fan outweigh moral consideration when it come to end popular long run cable series and that a good hero be hard to kill off no_matter how_many people he ' kill himself
the endgame have a different importance though in dexter a more stylized and fanciful show with an even more single minded focus_on its protagonist 's psyche
the question of dexter 's fate be bake into the gothic premise a psychopath train by his adoptive father a police_officer to be an honorable killer dispatch only those_who need killing
and the show 's mix of film noir and fairy_tale seem to leave open the possibility of redemption and even a happy ending
the result be that for at_least two and perhaps three season it have feel as if we would be in a long process of preparation for sunday_night with story line whose primary purpose be to push dexter ever closer to an edge that keep recede as the show 's rating remain strong by premium cable standard
season 7 and 8 have be the show 's highest rat average 2.1 million to 2.2 million_viewer
it have be a frustrating ride for those of us who love the show 's early season when it achieve an unusually happy balance of interesting long arc dexter 's progress toward humanity and his intense relationship_with his foster sister the dedicated cop deb and snappy short_term storytelling his season length battle with other serial killer and his dealing with his droll colleague in the homicide squad of the miami police
in_addition to gore suspense and heartbreak include the authentically shocking murder of dexter 's wife at the end of season 4 dexter be also mark by its easygoing sunny vibe and its undercurrent of jab workplace humor
as the rest of the cable drama landscape grow increasingly grim and heavy handed it be a welcome respite like pick_up a fast and punchy charles willeford novel miami blues say after slog through a well review pretentious literary mystery
even as the story have lose some of its steam in recent season it_' be worth stay around because of the cast begin with michael c. hall and jennifer carpenter as dexter and deb and include excellent support performance by david zayas c. s. lee and desmond harrington as cop who never_quite figure_out that their blood spatter analyst be murder people under their nose
ms. carpenter the fire to mr. hall 's ice in the show 's central relationship have suffer the most from the need to keep the show go last_season deb kill an innocent a superior officer no less to protect her foster brother and have since be an uneasy partner in his plot
it_' a development that have strain credulity even in the hothouse context of dexter and the water be further muddy by her admission to a therapist that she be attract to her brother
it probably would have be better if none of these_thing have happen which be to say that it would have be better if the show have wrap up by season 5 or 6
but here we be in season 8 and the good_news be that the pace have pick_up recently as you would expect
the icelandic actor darri ingolfsson step into the shoe of past guest star like john lithgow and jimmy smits have make the dexter doppelgã¤nger oliver saxon a chill worthy adversary
viewer who be up to date spoiler ahead will know that dexter 's decision to walk away_from a kill ready himself mentally for that idyllic new life in argentina have have potentially tragic result
i will admit here that i have see the finale and know the answer to my initial question
i wo_not give anything away except that i expect that it will be controversial prepare_for a twitter storm around 9:45 p.m. on_sunday and that while i do_not buy everything in the episode i buy the end
you may or may not think that dexter 's final resting place be the one he deserve
but it work
frankfurt even_though the federal_reserve have decide to maintain_its economic_stimulus for now the recent behavior of global financial_market and national economy show just how tricky it will be for the world to adjust to life_without central_bank painkiller
the mere prospect of a gradual decline in fed bond_purchase in the united_states push up borrowing rate in europe in recent_month even as the european central_bank be try_to tamp them down with its_own limited set of remedy
but whether in the united_states europe or elsewhere the big dos of monetary_stimulus of the sort the fed have be administer since the global financial_crisis erupt five_year can go only so_far in heal sick economy
the withdrawal symptom as market have anticipate a fed tapering of the dosage include the fluctuation in currency value over the summer that add a new element of uncertainty for multinational company
and an investor exodus from develop_country threaten to undercut the buying power of some of europe 's most_important customer
although european stock rise thursday and market rate for government bond decline after the fed say it would continue dispense its stimulus at full strength a bit longer those movement be very likely only a temporary reprieve from disruptive force largely outside europe 's control
this be a deferral it_' not a cancellation say carl weinberg chief_economist at high frequency economics in valhalla new_york
high rate be come
now the question be what if anything policy_maker outside the united_states will do about it
in europe at_least the early indication be not much
european leader be still too preoccupied with their_own domestic political problem to act more aggressively to stimulate demand and promote job growth for the euro_zone
they be too fractured and factionalized to take the action that be beyond the scope of the monetary_policy of the european central_bank like spend on common infrastructure or other joint project that may help put people and company back to work
and they seem to have run out of energy for further overhaul of the flawed architecture of the currency union include continue aggressive action to fix europe 's trouble bank
in germany the euro_zone 's wealthy country chancellor_angela merkel may be constrain even after election on_sunday be behind her
that be because even_though her christian_democrats be likely_to retain power poll on_thursday show that alternative for germany a right_wing party that want_to dissolve the euro will_probably get enough vote to win seat in parliament
meanwhile italy which still have one of europe 's big economy despite its debt problem be once_again preoccupy with silvio berlusconi the former prime_minister
despite his legal peril mr._berlusconi still have the political clout to disrupt the stability of the italian government
marco tronchetti provera chairman of the italian tire maker pirelli say by_telephone that europeans need a clear signal that thing be get better so that they would be willing_to start spend again
without a project to regain confidence it_' difficult to predict a strong recovery he say
but he be pessimistic about the ability of european leader to act
what_we need be a simple and more effective euro which mean strong integration with bureaucratic simplification mr. provera say
the decision make process in europe be too complex
the european economy have emerge_from a recession that last a year and a half
but the growth have little momentum of its_own and remain dependent on demand from abroad include the united_states and develop_country like china and brazil
as a result the euro_zone be acutely sensitive to policy make in washington over which it have little influence 1_2 next_page
berlin germany_'s race for parliament tighten thursday three day_before election with fresh poll underline the difficulty that even the popular chancellor_angela merkel face in build a win coalition
ms._merkel 's social democratic challenger peer_steinbrã¼ck a classic center leftist who have deep experience in germany_'s state and federal_government urge his party to make the most of what it say be collapse support for the chancellor and her christian_democrats
in three day you_can be rid of them
mr._steinbrã¼ck tell a crowd gather in alexanderplatz in the heart of former east berlin accuse the merkel lead coalition of be the most quarrelsome useless and backward look government in modern german history
the chancellor herself mr._steinbrã¼ck charge have give no direction in the past four_year
instead she prefer to drive around in circle like a caged tiger at the berlin zoo he_add
two poll publish thursday show that ms._merkel 's coalition have a narrow lead ahead of sunday 's vote
accord_to a telephone survey for the public television network zdf the chancellor 's center right party be back by 40_percent of voter while its partner the business minded free_democrats be support by 6 percent
the center leave social_democrats earn the backing of 27 percent of voter while their prefer partner the greens earn 9_percent
the poll survey 1,369 voter on_tuesday and wednesday and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage_point
another survey conduct_by insa for the newspaper bild zeitung show that ms._merkel 's party have the support of 38 percent of voter and the free_democrats have the backing of 6 percent
support for the social_democrats and greens be consistent_with the zdf poll at 28 percent and 8 percent respectively
alternative for germany which reject the euro garner 5_percent compare_with 4 percent in the zdf survey pass the 5_percent threshold would make it a surprise entry into parliament
the poll survey 2,248 voter by_telephone from sunday to wednesday and have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage_point
both major party insist_that germany_'s future be firmly in europe have rule out a coalition with alternative for germany
if the anti euro party do get into parliament it could reduce the number of seat ms._merkel 's coalition receive force her to forge a so_call grand_coalition with the social_democrats
that would match the coalition that govern in her first term when mr._steinbrã¼ck be finance minister and the pair together guide germany through the 2008 financial_crisis
and it would potentially make mr._steinbrã¼ck a major player in the next phase of germany_'s leadership whether his party win or not
mr._steinbrã¼ck 66 have say that he will not be part_of another grand_coalition
but it be increasingly clear that he would like to be part_of negotiate whatever program the two big party can thrash out
the uncertainty of the outcome mean that the european_union which have be hold its breath as the german vote near be likely_to wait a few more month before learn where berlin would like to guide the troubled continent
mr._steinbrã¼ck a bright but sometimes bluster politician be regard as a strong alternative to ms._merkel 59 when he declare his_candidacy a year_ago
almost immediately however he start to stumble first over disclosure that he have receive $ 1.7_million for speech and writing then over whether politician be pay enough and next over a suggestion that he would never buy cheap wine
his party which be still divide over a legacy of labor and welfare overhaul that it initiate when last in power under ms._merkel 's predecessor gerhard schrã¶der be slow to get its campaign roll
even as late as july mr._steinbrã¼ck seem a somewhat reluctant slogger on the trail
since his lone television debate with ms._merkel on_sept. 1 from which he emerge look as if he could be chancellor mr._steinbrã¼ck have take to campaigning with zest
in a format that be unusual for german election_campaign which tend_to be script and repetitive he have hit the road with a strategy call plain talk in which citizen sit around him as he field their write question filter through a moderator but not obviously prepared
mr._steinbrã¼ck who once govern germany_'s most populous state north rhine westphalia have one of the ready wit on the campaign trail
i_'ll start off answer your question and then i_think it_' a 120-minute election speech and i will read it to make it even more boring he say as he take the stage one evening in munich last_week with barely 1,500 supporter shiver through his presentation
he have regularly accuse the news_medium of write his political obituary in advance remind a television interviewer on_aug. 30 that in soccer a national passion here it_' not a matter of the first 20_minute but of the last 10 as to who win
i be amazed at how_many people in your profession have_already write their ready commentary he_add
mr._steinbrã¼ck become a national topic of conversation last_weekend when the magazine of the newspaper sã¼ddeutsche zeitung show him give his middle finger in reaction to an interviewer who have ask_him to respond to unkind nickname attach to him during the campaign
the photo be from late july when mr._steinbrã¼ck be far behind the chancellor in personal popularity poll
he still trail but by less
many germans say that even_if they do_not share ms._merkel 's center right politics they believe_that she have do a good job of guide the nation to relative prosperity in europe handle the euro crisis and reduce unemployment
her party which in the last two election saw its support drop just ahead of the actual vote have make ms._merkel the center of its campaign
since her free democratic partner make a poor showing in bavarian state election last_sunday she have appeal directly to voter appear on national television late wednesday to urge people to cast both their vote for district candidate and party list for her and the christian_democrats
that she be tell germans be the only way to guarantee she stay in charge
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_19 2013an_earlier version_of this_article misquote remark by peer_steinbrã¼ck to an audience in munich last week.â

mr. holder 's memorandum say that for case in which a defendant have_already be find_guilty but no sentence have yet be impose prosecutor have discretion about_whether to apply the new policy
they be encourage to apply the policy in guilty plea case where legally and practically feasible he write but they should generally not seek relief for a defendant who choose to go to trial

piscataway n.j.
two_year ago paul james could_not get a single division i football program to notice him
he spend college sign day in_2011 sitting in class at glassboro high_school in south jersey
his coach work the phone furiously hop for a late break
the fax machine stay silent
it really hit me james say
like wow i have nothing go for me.'â more_than four dozen other prospect from new_jersey include run_back savon huggins sign letter of intent that day a glut of talent that rutgers help corral
to james rutgers official offer this show up on june 25 and we will give you a walk on spot
since_then james have replace huggins as the scarlet knights start run_back and after three astonishing game he lead the football bowl subdivision with 493 rushing yard an average of 8.1 yard_per carry
when rutgers 2_1 host arkansas at high point solutions stadium on_saturday james will receive the bulk of the carry
but he be not the team 's only contribute walk on
michael burton a fullback will be block for him in what rutgers believe to be the only nonscholarship start backfield for a major college in the country
they be the no star tandem an improbable twosome in an era when recruiter net be cast wider and wider
an overlooked talent will occasionally amble onto a roster and emerge as a sensation as dominique whaley do at oklahoma not long_ago when he arrive as if bear from a cloud of dust
but in new_jersey
it just show what_we overcome james say
we both come in as walk ons and it show how strong we be to get to this point and how hard we have to work to keep it as be
burton grow_up in long valley n.j. as a die hard rutgers fan attend summer camp on campus as a high_school junior and senior
but burton who be an oversize 220-pound run_back say college seem hesitant
he say he have offer from low tier program like towson new_hampshire and maine but only marginal recruiting interest from his top choice rutgers
instead like james he be extend a lukewarm invitation come to practice and see if_you can stick
there be never any guarantee in life you have to prove yourself every single day burton a redshirt junior say
i use that as motivation
james and burton be so_call preferred walk ons prospect whom the coach staff notice and like but do_not offer scholarship
it be not the low rung on the college sport ladder but the ground be mighty close
burton and james begin as practice pawn and member of the scout team often line up against the first team defense and mimic what another team may run
they be in the dredge of the team 's depth chart
but eventually the coaching staff take notice
we do_not really talk_about be walk ons burton say
we_'re out there try_to win game
how do so_many program miss the speedy james who have six touchdown in three game
different player end_up in different situation for different reason rutgers coach kyle flood say
from what i understand he have some injury issue his senior year of high_school
i_think when coach see that they be probably less_likely to invest a scholarship at that point in a player
james sustain a high ankle sprain in the third_quarter of the first game of his senior year after rush for 1,730 yard for tiny glassboro as a junior
that fall college have begin to show interest tulane marshall east carolina temple and even penn_state james 's top choice
but the ankle injury the next season halt his momentum
he miss two game and then begin lose playing time to corey clement a talented junior who wind up commit to wisconsin
james 's recruitment fall off
as his senior year kind_of tick away a_lot of those other school wind up kind_of fall off greg maccarone the glassboro offensive coordinator say
two low tier college delaware and james madison remain interested_in james as a defensive player and marshall and east carolina give him offer that quickly expire
he hedge and both scholarship be fill
so james wait until he could_not wait any longer
he begin call college and send tape mining for a glimmer of interest
he visit the team close to home temple as_well as rutgers that may. greg schiano then the coach of the scarlet knights tell_him he could show up in_june and have a roster spot but nothing else be guarantee
i could either look_at it as an insult or an opportunity to grab james say
i could get in here and work my way up the food chain and get to where we_want to be
if it all sound a bit like the movie rudy james say the thought have enter his mind too
if_you 're a walk on if_you do_not have a scholarship if_you be not highly recruit that ' how people look_at you they will doubt you james say
you just can_not let that get to you

at the sushi counter at kura there be no sentinel in white no silent coolly appraise overlord
norihiro ishizuka 70 stand alone wear not a crisp chef 's coat but a samue traditionally a monk 's work robe that slouch at his waist like a dress gown
he have a benevolent and slightly rakish air with his faint pencil mustache and white gray hair peek out of the bottom of his cap
he nod and grin already halfway to a laugh and the meal have not yet begin
outside kura 's east_village shopfront be austere a blank wall crosshatch by the shadow of a fire escape with no sign save a linen drape hang in an archway ink with an unfinished circle
inside 12 seat line a blond wood counter
delicate jazz chime above
but this be not a shrine
behind mr._ishizuka be expose brick and the rough edge seem to suit him
no glass case separate him from diner instead fish be heap unceremoniously in a wide shallow basket
mr._ishizuka heft the fish up and slap it back down as if assemble sushi be a purely practical matter not require a soundtrack by philip glass
the great sushi chef of new_york tend_to be musical in their movement
think of masato shimizu of 15 east the curve of his finger as elegant as a cellist 's or eiji ichimura of ichimura at brushstroke bend intently over his creation like glenn gould and barely speak above a whisper
mr._ishizuka be more of a tony bennett a crooner work the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand
he make sushi with substantial cut of fish tricky to eat in a single bite
alongside beautifully fresh kampachi tuna salmon and aji horse mackerel may be aka uni the large sweeter red sea urchin from the channel islands off california scallop balance on a band of nori over rice and saba mackerel present kyoto style fish and rice roll together in cloth and cut like slab of cake twice the height of ordinary sushi
keep in mind those rough edge
one evening the vein of fat in marble otoro be more resistant than yield ikura salmon roe be unchecked in its saltiness tamago a block of egg scramble with sugar sake and dashi be sweet without nuance
these seem less like misstep than choice come from a fondness for more direct flavor
soy sauce be provide but no wasabi
you will not miss it
instead there be tip of finger lime to be rub on the fish until their tiny juice sac squeeze out look_like pale green roe and burst tartly in the mouth
all meal be omakase start at a reasonable $ 65 for 10 piece of nigiri and a hand roll which mr._ishizuka hand to you across the counter with a flourish soup aka dashi perhaps deepen with long ferment black miso and an appetizer tuna snowcapped with sticky mountain yam and stipple with nori dust say or creamy orange ankimo monkfish liver under grate daikon saturate red by chile
also available be osaka style kappo cook dish attune to the season less formal than kaiseki
these may include sesame tofu which be not tofu at all but a perfect cold cube of ground white sesame paste its taste at once familiar and ethereal and tuna tail brush with an understated teriyaki sauce char and strew with miniature rice cracker pearl
mr._ishizuka come from japan to new_york in the late 1980 to preside at umeda near gramercy park then decamp to a restaurant in michigan
one of his partner at kura huey cheng work for him there as a waiter a role that mr. cheng 24 reprises here along_with help to make the sushi rice and finish the kappo dish in the back kitchen
one night mr._ishizuka offer everyone at the counter shiokara an izakaya snack of fermented squid gut
i have eat the dish before and still it take my breath away like down a jigger of seawater intensely salty and fishy sop yet crunchy
other diner wince and giggle nervously
mr._ishizuka lean over to an old japanese gentleman at the counter
for the young one he say and they laugh

joseph_j. lhota face on_thursday with another poll show him far behind bill_de blasio in new_york 's mayoral race propose hold weekly debate hop they may alter the dynamic of the contest
mr._lhota a republican say that the two city sponsor debate which be already schedule for late october be insufficient and that the man should face off in all five borough
i_think it_' important that we go out to the people and they see the contrast_between the two of us he say in an afternoon news_conference on the step of city_hall add we have two very very_different philosophy
mr._de blasio speak to reporter in the bronx do_not accept or reject mr._lhota 's proposal
we be go to figure_out the best way to go about debate and most importantly the televise debate program where most people have the opportunity to see the contrast_between the candidate and you will see plenty_of contrast say mr._de blasio a democrat
i guarantee there will be a good number of debate
i look_forward to them
mr._lhota make his proposal shortly_after another poll show mr._de blasio with a commanding lead underscore the long odds mr._lhota face in a city where democrats far outnumber republican
in the new poll_release by quinnipiac university mr._de blasio have the support of 66 percent of likely_voter compare_with 25_percent for mr._lhota
the independence_party candidate adolfo carriã³n jr. receive 2 percent
a poll of likely_voter release on_tuesday by wnbc the wall_street journal and marist college show mr._de blasio with a 43-point lead

ninety percent of black voter support him as do 68 percent of hispanic voter and 52 percent of white voter
more voter view mr._lhota unfavorably than favorably which may be a consequence of the barrage of negative television advertisement that a republican rival john_a. catsimatidis broadcast during the primary

the boyfriend who be still a high_school senior have be my_daughter 's summer fling before she leave for college last september
with my last child go i_think i would be terribly sad and lonely

then in may the school year end and my_daughter come home for the summer
after be away for so long she could barely wait to see her boyfriend
he move into her bedroom the night she arrive and hardly ever leave except to attend his last_few class of high_school
the two of them be so enamored of each_other i do_not have the heart to separate them
i assume they would soon grow bore with see each_other every_day and he would go home
this do_not happen
the big problem be that my_daughter and her boyfriend bring with them a level of messiness i have grow unaccustomed to
they shed clothing like dog shed fur pepper the apartment with sweatshirt t_shirt and underwear
they prefer my shower to hers and soon the drain be clog with hair
while i be out of town on business they move into my bedroom too i have a king size bed and they find it roomy
they produce mound of laundry garbage and recycling
the water and electricity bill both shoot up
my_daughter love cooking and decide that her summer job be to teach her boyfriend to cook
unfortunately their enthusiasm do_not extend to clean up
i would arrive home from work to dirty dish and half fill pot and pan on the stove
the kitchen floor would be sticky the stovetop spatter with oil and the oven bottom crusty with burn food
when i ask_if the boyfriend may help out a little by do dish or take out the compost my_daughter say he ' phobic about get his hand dirty
i_'m sure that work well for him i reply
weeks pass as the lovebird languish in my apartment
i would leave for work at 10:30_a.m. and return at 7_p.m. to find them exactly where i have leave them sprawl on the couch watch rerun of monk
the only way i could tell they have even move be that the food i have buy for dinner be go and the kitchen be a mess

judith gille live in seattle
her memoir the view from casa chepitos a journey beyond the border be to be publish next_month by davis bay press
jhumpa lahiri first make her name with quiet meticulously observe story about indian immigrant try_to adjust to new life in the united_states story that have the hush intimacy of chamber music
the premise of her new novel the lowland in contrast be startlingly operatic
udayan an idealistic student in calcutta in the 1960 be draw into mao inspire revolutionary politics
after his violent death which happen fairly early in the novel his devoted dutiful brother subhash marry his pregnant widow gauri and bring her to america in hope of give her a new start in a new country
their marriage though will remain haunted by their memory of udayan and a terrible secret gauri keep to herself
the lowland be certainly ms._lahiri 's most ambitious undertaking yet and it eventually open out into a move family story
it be initially hobble however by page and page of historical exposition by a schematic plotline and by a disjunction between the author 's scrupulous lapidary prose and the dramatic dickensian event she recount
it be only in the second_half that ms._lahiri 's talent for capture the small emotional detail of her character daily life take_over immerse us in their story and make us less aware of the book 's creaky and often noisy hydraulics
in her 2003 novel the namesake as in her two collection of short story unaccustomed earth and the pulitzer_prize win interpreter of maladies the life of ms._lahiri 's character be make palpably real to us through her exacting evocation of their day to day routine the wonder bread sandwich tint green with curry that a bengali mother make for her embarrassed daughter to take to school the careful adoption of american ritual like make snowman or dye easter egg
such particular accentuate the difference_between immigrant parent and their american bear child and the almost existential sense of dislocation that exile can produce in people_who feel at home neither in their ancestral country nor in the united_states
while the reader come to know these earlier people as distinct individual the character in the lowland seem to have be conceive as representative type with designate role to play in a family melodrama construct to underscore generational pattern of resentment and redemption rootedness and freedom
udayan be the rebellious impulsive brother who make a series of reckless decision that will affect everyone who love him for decade to come
subhash be the nice rational brother who will spend_much of his life deal_with the fallout from his sibling 's heedless action
gauri be an angry selfish woman who will repay subhash 's generosity and kindness and his effort to invent a new life for them in rhode_island with chilly disregard
subhash 's mother have try_to dissuade him from marry gauri tell_him that she ' udayan 's wife she will never love you
she also warn him that gauri be too withdrawn too aloof to be a mother
though this prophecy have be deliver by a woman embitter by the death of her favorite son it will turn_out to be all too true gauri will abandon her_daughter bela conceive with udayan and bring up by subhash as his_own beloved child to pursue her_own dream of study philosophy and build an academic career
ms._lahiri never manage to make this terrible act handle by gauri with cruelty and arbitrary highhandedness plausible understandable or viscerally feel
why would gauri regard motherhood and career as an either/or choice
why make no effort to stay in touch with bela or explain her decision to move to california
why not discuss her need to leave her marriage and her child with her_husband
because ms._lahiri never give us real insight_into gauri 's decision making or psychology she come across not as a flawed and complicated person but as a folk tale parody of a cold selfish witch who ' fulfil her nasty mother in law 's bad prediction
the reader often have the sense that ms._lahiri be try_to fit her character into a predetermined narrative design which can make for diagrammatic and unsatisfying storytelling
what turn this novel around and ultimately seize the reader 's imagination be ms._lahiri 's deeply feel depiction of subhash 's relationship_with bela his unwavering devotion to this good hearted little_girl his bafflement as her grief over her_mother 's abandonment lead her to withdraw_from him as_well his slow painful effort to rebuild a life for himself in the wake of gauri 's departure
it be in these late chapter that the cumbersome historical exposition and overarching narrative architecture fall away and ms._lahiri 's most shining gift as a writer come to the fore her ability_to conjure the daily texture of people 's life her understanding_of how their personal and cultural expectation have shape their choice her talent for map mood and inchoate emotion with pointillist precision
as this happen the character in the lowland with the qualified exception of gauri become fully human drive not by one identifiable trait like duty anger or rebellion but by a full spectrum of feeling and capable not only of rage and vexation but also of forgiveness and hope
by its end this ungainly novel remind us of ms._lahiri 's copious talent as a writer however imperfectly they be employ here

this be already go to be a banner season at the san_francisco opera for the american soprano patricia racette
her performance always thoughtful and touching ms. racette have long be a favorite here and she be schedule to star in no few than three of the year 's eight production
then as tend_to happen in the hyperdramatic world of opera calamity strike
late last_month the powerful mezzo soprano dolora zajick who have be give the title role in tobias picker 's new opera dolores claiborne an adaptation of the stephen_king novel drop out cite bad knee and the part 's vocal and physical challenge
ms. zajick have an understudy the veteran mezzo catherine cook but the company no_doubt want a big name for such a prominent premiere
so ms. racette who have create role in two prior picker opera emmeline 1996 and an american tragedy present by the metropolitan opera in 2005 step up and learn the part in time for opening_night on_wednesday
ms. cook will sing the two final performance schedule for early october
ms. racette 's admirable move be that of an authentic trouper a gutsy act that should not be underestimate particularly since ms. racette be concurrently star in boito 's mefistofele
you_want her to succeed
if in the end though she merely acquit herself nicely it be more the fault of mr. picker and his librettist the poet j._d. mcclatchy than it be hers
their drab dolores have a drab dolores at its center
which be surprising since dullness be the one thing you could_not accuse mr. king 's 1992 best seller of be
this be the first operatic adaptation that mr. king have approve but not the last the shining by paul moravec and mark campbell be schedule to open at the minnesota opera in 2016
dolores claiborne take the inherently theatrical form of a monologue dolores an age housekeeper on a tiny island off of maine be at a police interrogation deny the charge that she murder her rich capricious employer vera donovan
dolores do however freely confess to kill her_husband joe st. george decade earlier
she be irresistibly profane candid and contentious as her story plunge back to her miserable marriage to joe a lazy alcoholic who beat her and sexually abuse their daughter selena
during a solar eclipse she finally lure him drunk and furious into the backyard well ensure selena 's future but also painfully their estrangement
there be clear operatic potential in a woman who turn homicidal when she have her back up against the wall
not for nothing be the san_francisco opera call mr. picker 's dolores claiborne an american tosca
but puccini ruthlessly effective in his melody and his dramaturgy make you believe to the depth of your being in the love that propel tosca 's fate forward and the evil that stand in her way
his pacing be swift and inexorable
mr. picker and mr. mcclatchy on the other_hand have create an opera that hover rather_than hurtles
while we be tell that dolores care for selena they sing a duet after all we never feel it so her sacrifice do_not pack any punch
that be not to say that mr. picker 's craftsmanship be ever less_than expert
his score cleanly arrange for a traditional orchestra be consistent and coherent in its post romantic brooding rather_than fashionably eclectic
conduct_by george manahan it simmer clearly enough to make all the exposition audible the scene be separate by interlude full of grand wave of sound
there be lovely detail throughout
early in the first act vera 's admonition to her maid about properly hang the sheet to dry set to angular jitter open up into sumptuous ardor then close again into anxiety with an ease of transition that recall janacek
the collaborator have invent an ingeniously creepy nursery rhyme for joe the resonant fearless bass baritone wayne tigges to sing as he molest selena with a translucent percussive accompaniment
but as with too_much contemporary american opera the vocal line strand between speak and sing dissonance and tonal lyricism leave sen ten ce with odd stil ted stress es
and the trapping of traditional grand opera embrace by mr. picker do_not serve this particular story
a party scene at vera 's mansion promise to be like the wedding in lucia di lammermoor interrupt by some horrible public revelation but nothing much happen
two soar aria one for dolores and one for selena both seem extraneous mean to relieve tension but serve only to halt momentum
selena 's sing with pure tone by the soprano susannah biller be an ode to the star that ultimate poetic cliche 1_2

it be the culmination of leger 's contrast of forms,'â say emily braun mr. lauder 's longtime curator refer_to a series of painting and drawing base_on opposition of shape line and color
although leger be know best for his image of urban dynamism in this picture and in a second identically sized version_of it in the sprengel museum in hanover germany he paint a village use the color of the french flag blue white and red as a patriotic gesture since he make these work right before leave to fight in world_war i.

violence against child strike most people as a uniquely terrible phenomenon which may be why filmmaker be so fond of it
nothing spark a revenge plot or allow a director to trade intellectual nuance for visceral feeling quite as efficiently as a child in peril
when deal_with people_who gratuitously cause the innocent to suffer no retribution seem too extreme and the history of movie be full of good man and a few woman drive to righteous brutality against predator kidnapper and abuser
keller dover the enrage
grief addled father play by hugh jackman in denis villeneuve 's prisoner seem_like such a character
he ' not a person keller say of the man he believe be responsible_for the abduction of his young daughter and her friend
and this conviction that the apparent perpetrator have forfeit his humanity allow an honorable family man to contemplate torture and murder
he beat his captive bloody and lock him in a makeshift cell in an abandon building hop to extract the truth and perhaps also a measure of rough justice
when the other girl 's parent viola davis and terrence howard express doubt about what keller be do their qualm strike him as evidence of weakness and irrationality
but if prisoners write by aaron guzikowski uphold some of the convention of the angry dad revenge drama it also subvert them in surprising at time devastating way
the easy catharsis of righteous payback be complicate at every turn and pain and uncertainty spread like spill oil on an asphalt road
when the girl anna and joy go miss late on thanksgiving afternoon suspicion focus_on the driver of a camper that have be park in their small_town pennsylvania neighborhood

then a dead body be find in an elderly priest 's basement and a second young_man with a nervous manner and a haunted look show up at a vigil for the miss child and run away into the night
false lead and shadowy connection proliferate and nobody know if anna and joy be dead or alive
it_' all very creepy and mysterious and prisoners be among_other thing a satisfy whodunit with artfully deposit clue and twist that be surprising without entirely undermine the film 's naturalistic credibility
but mr. villeneuve a french canadian director whose previous movie include incendies and polytechnique be more invest in mood and meaning than in plot
a connoisseur of grim tale incendies be about the endless trauma of a middle_eastern civil_war polytechnique be base_on the true story of a shooting_rampage at a montreal university
he have an_intense almost philosophical interest in the nature of evil
like zodiac mystic river and the silence of the lambs prisoner suggest_that evil be not confine to a single person or set of action
crime be specify and criminal be discover but empirical solution be not enough to dispel the feeling that an uncontained atmospheric menace brood over this wintry landscape
roger a. deakins 's somber cinematography turn the keystone state into a study of gray and brown dead leaf and bare tree under a sky like wet metal
keller a survivalist with a basement full of canned good and battery seem to have be infect by it even before the disappearance of his daughter
his_wife maria bello tip into a pool of despair
other people like the aunt of one of the suspect melissa leo be weigh down by bad luck and weary dread
but the most tormented character may be detective loki jake gyllenhaal whose connection to the kidnapping be professional rather_than personal
like keller loki be a familiar figure in a movie like this and the contrast_between them the hotheaded impulsive avenger and the cool careful sleuth be something we have see before
mr. jackman be solid and persuasive but it be mr. gyllenhaal with his downturned mouth and twitchy eye who anchor the film
we know nothing of loki 's off duty life if he even have one but he be the sensitive skeptical filter through which we try_to imagine the fate that could have befall two happy child play on a november afternoon
nearly all of prisoners take_place within a single week but mr. villeneuve wisely if also somewhat cruelly refuse_to speed_up or to spike the action with jolt of adrenaline
he capture with impressive discipline just how slowly time can move during a crisis how the static condition of not know can press down on every moment
panic can be paralyze as it be for keller 's wife and joy 's parent but act rashly as keller be incline to can have catastrophic effect
prisoner be the kind_of movie that can quiet a room full of casual thrill seeker
it absorb and control your attention with such assurance that you hold your breath for fear of distract the people on screen exhale in relief or amazement at each new revelation
by the end you may be a little wear out and perhaps also slightly let down by the fussily clever revelation that wrap up the story but in the meantime you be a willing captive unable_to tell the difference_between dread and delight

steve murphy swear he have nothing against his parent
but at age 27 mr. murphy who have his_own financial planning business do_not feel_like he should still be live in his childhood home in massapequa long_island
i_think i be push the limit to be honest with you he say
but you almost become complacent
you almost think it_' the norm
in a sense it be
accord_to a new report_from the regional plan association an urban research and policy group 55 percent of all 20- to 34-year old on long_island still live with their parent which be up 11 percent in a decade and appear to be one of the high rate in the country
but while some may actively choose to sleep in full view of their teenage poster and trophy most be there because there be few other place they can go
nassau and suffolk counties suffer from an acute shortage of rental apartment accord_to the report long_island 's rental housing crisis which state that the place that practically invent the postwar tract suburb have fail to keep pace with housing trend since
for year government_official housing advocate and real_estate executive on long_island have warn about the exodus of young_people not to mention the difficulty of housing low wage earner
but the regional plan association report draw some tough conclusion
the shortage of affordable rental home be already strain long_island 's economy and will make it much hard to compete for job in the year ahead it say
â
what seem hard to dispute be that long_island be seriously crunch for apartment compare_with other suburb
base_on census_data 21 percent of long_island 's household live in rental compare_with 33 percent in western connecticut 34 percent in the hudson valley and 37 percent in northern new_jersey number analyst consider a healthier portion
long_island 's 4 percent vacancy rate be also at the low end of the scale put pressure_on rent which average $ 1,490 a month in county where income have steadily decline accord_to the report
blame for the problem can be lay at the foot of many of the island 's nearly 100 village government whose zoning ban have severely restrict multifamily housing say christopher jones the vice_president of research for the regional plan association and an author of the report
by_contrast in new_jersey there_' be a spike in the construction of rental housing since the state 's supreme_court rule in the early 1980 that municipality could_not use zoning to exclude low_income people and by extension often minority from wealthy area
mr. jones stress that tweak the zoning on long_island to allow more apartment do_not have to mean that the low slung spread out look of the island epitomize by the curve cape line street of levittown would disappear
indeed the rental could be add in compact downtown business district which could in turn benefit_from customer in their often struggle store he_add
the character do_not have to change mr. jones say
you will still have the same single_family neighborhood that people think of when they think of long_island
there will just be more choice
yet the pro growth slant of mr. jones 's report have irk some critic who note_that some of the report 's contributor employee of building trade association and bank for_instance stand to gain from development project
long_island have be trouble by a tight rental market since the 1940 when its farm begin to get plow under for subdivision say robert w. burchell the chairman of the urban planning department at rutgers university
dr. burchell know that scenario firsthand
from 1947 to 1959 when he be a child his_family rent a series of home in nassau county
we have to move anytime the landlord find somebody willing_to pay more he say
but long_island for the most part have prosper all the same with low crime rate good school and high property value all the hallmark of a desirable area he say 1_2 next_page
homeowner with a mortgage insure by the federal housing administration or the department of veterans_affairs should consider use their loan term as a marketing tool when it come time to sell
mortgage loan from both government agency include a little know feature know as assumability
in other_word the buyer of a home finance with an exist f.h.a. or v.a. loan may be_able to take_over or assume the seller 's loan under the same term rather_than take out a new mortgage
during period when interest_rate be rise home offer for sale with an assumable low rate mortgage may have extra appeal for certain buyer
you could now have a seller say i have a great house to sell you and a great mortgage to go with it which be better_than my neighbor who only have a great house,'â say marc israel an executive_vice president of kensington vanguard national land services and a real_estate lawyer
it_' a very clever idea
the saving for buyer assume a loan extend beyond a low interest_rate
assume a loan be cheap than apply for a new one because there be few settlement fee
an appraisal be not require though a buyer may want_to obtain one anyway
and in new_york borrower assume a loan do_not have to pay the hefty mortgage recording tax a second time mr. israel say
â f.h.a. loan do demand that the borrower pay for mortgage insurance over the life of the loan
but when assume a loan borrower do_not have to pay the upfront mortgage insurance premium require on a new loan accord_to john walsh the president of total mortgage services in milford conn.
and he note because the original mortgage holder would have be pay the loan for a number of year the buyer assume the loan will start at a point deeper into the amortization schedule than on a new loan
that mean more of the monthly_payment will go toward principal
in a rise rate environment assumability be a very attractive option say katie miller the vice_president of mortgage product for navy federal credit union
it end_up make home that much_more affordable
she emphasize however that loan assumption be often not a viable option for first_time buyer if the seller have accumulate substantial equity in the home
say for_example that the seller 's loan balance be $ 150,000 and the sale price for the property be $ 200,000
the borrower assume the loan must come_up with the $ 50,000 difference either in cash or through some type_of subordinate financing
that can be too big a hurdle for first_time buyer
the more attractive option at navy federal be the homebuyers choice loan which offer 100_percent financing
these loan currently account for about a quarter of the credit union 's purchase volume and 65_percent of those borrower be first_time buyer ms. miller say
borrower seek to assume a loan must also prove their creditworthiness as they would for any f.h.a. or v.a. loan
under f.h.a. rule once a new borrower be find to be creditworthy enough to assume a loan the lender must release the seller from any future liability for payment of that loan
borrower consider loan assumption should weigh the cost against other loan option pay_attention to the principal and interest payment the amount_of cash require upfront and the private mortgage insurance premium
at the end of the day mr. walsh say if the prospective buyer can come_up with the down payment and qualify_for the loan assumption then it could be a huge benefit
the new_york times company announce on_thursday that it would pay a quarterly dividend to its shareholder for the first_time in five_year
the company 's board vote to approve a dividend of 4 cent a share to all shareholder of record as of oct. 9 2013
it will be pay on_oct. 24 the week before the times announce its third_quarter earnings
the times have not pay a dividend since dec. 14 2008
the dividend which apply to both class a and class b share will cost the company roughly $ 24 million a year
in a statement mark thompson president and chief_executive of the times say that the board have conclude_that the strength of the balance sheet justify the restoration of a dividend
but mr._thompson warn_that the company would remain cautious in its financial strategy
give the expectation of continued volatility in advertising revenue and the fact_that our growth strategy be at an early stage of development we will maintain a prudent view of both the balance sheet and free cash flow he say
during recent earnings call analyst have repeatedly ask times executive to issue a dividend
in the first quarter of 2013 analyst note_that there be a sell off of the company 's stock after management announce it would not issue a dividend because of concern_about the financial state of the medium industry
but in_august the times report that it have swing to a profit from strong circulation revenue and lower operating cost
john janedis an analyst with ubs say that it make_sense for the times to issue a dividend now because the company be sell its final noncore asset the new_england media_group which include the boston globe
after that sale close next_month the times will be_able to focus exclusively on build its core brand the new_york times
you basically have a clean balance sheet you have free cash flow at the company mr. janedis say
he_add that a dividend also make_sense give how_much the company have slimmed down in term of asset
mr. janedis estimate that the times could afford to pay shareholder the dividend despite the medium industry 's financial challenge
even_if the ad market weaken further and there be virtually zero return on their growth initiative they can easily fund the dividend if not increase it mr. janedis say
in its last earnings report the times report that as of june 30 it have cash and security total about_$ 918 million
london ed miliband the leader of the opposition labour party appear to have prime_minister david_cameron on the rope
mr._cameron have just lose a vote in parliament on a nonbinding motion to consider military_action in syria over chemical_weapon the first_time in at_least a century that a prime_minister have not get parliamentary support for such a response
mr._cameron throw in the towel
but mr._miliband whose own position on the issue keep shift do_not seize the moment neither that night aug. 29 nor in the next day
he neither speak convincingly to the nation about the nature of its alliance its foreign_policy or its value nor do he attack mr._cameron effectively for mismanage the entire issue
in a sense both major party leader show themselves unable_to master their_own restive party
after three_year as head of labour mr._miliband just 43 have not manage to convince the british public that he be prime ministerial material
question_about his leadership will hang over his party 's annual conference which begin sunday
in the word of a columnist for the newspaper the guardian michael white mr._miliband while have good instinct flicker rather_than shin
john curtice professor of politics at strathclyde university in glasgow say more bluntly that polling show that mr._miliband be clearly not a help to his party and he may well be a hindrance
the coalition_government of the conservative mr._cameron and the liberal democrat nick clegg be unpopular mr. curtice say but there be deep doubt among voter about_whether mr._miliband believe in anything very strongly
people be unclear what he stand for mr. curtice say
it_' not just that he ' see as geeky or intellectual he have not manage to show people that he have a vision and a sense of direction
there_' a lack of definition
mr._miliband who become the labour party 's leader three_year ago after a devastating election defeat that end 13 year of labour government always have a huge task ahead of him even with new election not expect until may 2015
he become leader a few_month after his party be reject comprehensively say peter kellner a political_analyst who run a polling firm yougov
he be a cabinet minister and close to gordon brown so he be implicate in the wide reputation of a government that fail
any new labour leader would have trouble combat that
mr._miliband mr. kellner say have plainly not manage to break through as a person there be mountain of data on our web_site on how he be not regard as strong or tough or up to the job as prime_minister
in any case mr. kellner note britons historically give new government a second chance
it have be decade since a party new to opposition win a majority government after a single term
mr._miliband have real strength beyond intelligence and decency
he do_not support britain 's involvement in the iraq war which so badly damaged tony blair and he boldly oppose rupert murdoch 's powerful medium empire in the wake of the phone hack scandal
in my view ed 's leadership have be characterize by courage resilience and a determination to stand_up for family who have bear the brunt of economic tough time say stewart wood a close adviser to mr._miliband
he stand_up to rupert murdoch he stand_up to david_cameron on syria and he have not be afraid to say that labour have to turn the page from the blair/brown year
mr. wood say that labour 's emphasis_on how to reverse the decline in living standard that face most people in our country will help the party regain popularity
with the economy finally improve and the election more_than 18_month away labour will argue_that a mod recovery will benefit only a small slice of british society that need no help
part_of mr._miliband 's problem stem_from his past as a bright young aide and then minister in labour government and part come from the residue of his extraordinary decision to run for the leadership against his old brother david miliband who be a more senior figure have be foreign secretary
it be an openly freudian struggle which the young miliband win narrowly with the help of trade union vote david miliband have come_out ahead among labour lawmaker and party member
mr._miliband have struggle to lose both the taint of fratricide and the stain of be beholden to trade union boss who be not the most_popular figure in britain
to avoid further speculation david miliband finally quit his_own seat in parliament and leave the country recently begin a new job in new_york as the head of the international rescue committee a nongovernmental organization aid refugee
mr._cameron highlight the influence of union leader whenever possible
so recent claim that a union have rig the selection of labour 's candidate to fight a parliamentary seat in falkirk scotland prove highly embarrassing
mr._miliband set_up an inquiry which find no rule be break
but more boldly in an effort to show decisiveness he also announce_plan to end the automatic affiliation to labour of about three million union member unless they specifically ask otherwise
while union member will still be invite to join the party labour face an inevitable and significant drop in financing
still recent statement suggest_that union may retain significant influence over some labour decision make prompt claim that mr._miliband be backtrack and will accept a half measure
his allies argue_that an overhaul will be more successful step by step
but he may gain little credit anyway mr. curtice say give the perception that he be force into change by the falkirk controversy
be mr._miliband a tory leader with similar rating mr. kellner say he would be subject to a possible putsch
but labour have little tradition of dump its leader
mr._cameron and mr. clegg be not themselves especially popular
mr. clegg be consider to have sacrifice crucial element of his electoral agenda to get his party into the govern coalition and be clearly the junior player to mr._cameron
mr._cameron have oversee tough year of economic austerity and recession and he be be outflank on the right by an anti european party know as the united kingdom independence_party or ukip. mr. curtice think that labour should be significantly farther ahead in the poll than now its lead over the tories have shrink considerably since early summer
still he say give an electoral system that favor labour because of the distribution of its voter the unpopularity of the liberal democrats and slippage of conservative vote to ukip the labour party may win by default
do_not go look for fancy italian at osteria cucina rustica in marlboro
despite the impose facade of this restaurant in a former bank the fare be indeed rustic as the name suggest
flavor be simple
quality be high and most everything be make in house
much of what i sample on two visit be well prepared a main dish of risotto with delicate and juicy grill shrimp each grain separate and slightly al dente exquisite branzino fillet perfectly pan_sear and season with butter shallot white wine lemon and a sprinkle of caper lay over a bed of beluga lentil hearty hanger steak that be tender and delicious enough to continue eat past satiety
service be old school indulgent
we be lead to our table by young_woman all the waiter be attentive man in lab style white coat who pay_attention to water and wine and apologize when the main course take too long to arrive
price for such service food quality and attention to detail be not cheap but they be fair
others seem to agree since there be a robust size crowd there both night on my first visit a weekend several diner accompany_by woman and child display full sleeve tattoo on a weeknight though there be a few woman and couple it seem more like a businessman 's club
the ambience be mix
wide plank floor salvage from old barn around the country with expose beam above say down home the high ceiling and the sleek white tile see in the partly open kitchen behind glass suggest sophistication
the space be also inordinately loud and the air conditioning be so cold on both visit that i contemplate use the elegantly large napkin as a shawl
the owner angelo bongiovanni who act as host and steven botta the chef open the restaurant in mid july they be also partner in brando 's an italian restaurant in asbury park mr. bongiovanni say in a phone_interview
it be clear that they care about the food
a trio of amusement roast garlic in olive_oil herbed ricotta and pickle zucchini arrive alongside a basket of warm bread and be tasty with the addition of a bit of salt
among the appetizer the fritto misto which be mostly calamari with a cameo of shrimp and scallop be nicely do the fried batter enhance rather_than distract from the seafood the inclusion of caper berry their stem on tuck_into the seafood be a witty touch
burrata a special with prosciutto one night be diminish only slightly by its cool temperature the polenta with shave black truffle be agreeably hot but too_much pecorino romano mask the flavor of corn
of the three salad the caesar with its romaine heart and ciabatta crouton be best ingredient in the toscana chop green red onion tomato cucumber slice almond and dry cherry stubbornly resist melding and the finocchio a combination of fennel with parmigiano reggiano toast pine nut and slice orange lack flavor
a special appetizer of fig stuff with maytag blue cheese and roasted garlic then wrap in prosciutto and set atop small oval of cool watermelon be a terrific idea but with every bite i_wish that the prosciutto have not be broil to brown but leave pink and luscious
among the pasta the bolognese sauce be well flavored and balanced but the pasta serve with it pacheri imagine very fat unwieldy rigatoni leave us wonder how to eat it since we certainly could_not twirl it around a fork
farfalle with swiss chard gaeta olive and toast breadcrumb be flavorless hard to fathom with such assertive ingredient
as for the secondo that stellar branzino risotto with shrimp and barolo glaze hanger steak face competition from the pollo scarpariello
the pan sauteed chicken piece with sausage and lemon be serve with just enough potato piece to mash into the juice
vegetable be uninspired except for the mashed potato and intensely flavorful cherry tomato serve with the hanger steak
sauteed broccoli rabe be exceedingly mild to the point of boredom
and i have hop the swiss chard with fava bean puree would be a riff on the italian bean and green stew but no
it be a portion of green with a scoop of greenish gray matter on top
yes that be the bean and they taste o.k. but the dish need a do over
of the typical italian dessert we like the zabaglione and the affogato vanilla ice_cream top with espresso of the atypical the warm chocolate cake with a small scoop of ice_cream be memorable enough to put on my list for the next time i be in the neighborhood after a caesar salad and that branzino over lentil

behind close door art in the spanish american home 1492 1898 at the brooklyn museum leave us in the strange position of marvel_at the opulence of domestic life in the spanish colony while ponder some of the ugly aspect_of colonialism
this be awkward to be sure but also enlightening
as its voyeuristic title suggest the show follow the layout of a typical house belong_to an elite member of new world society
draw largely from the museum 's sizable collection of spanish colonial art it fashion a gorgeous set of temporary period room out of the fourth_floor special exhibition gallery
they overflow with sumptuous textile family portrait bear coat of arm fine silver and porcelain and gild everything arrange in the more be more manner of the spanish american upper crust with cabinet stack in pyramid and luxury good lay out on carpet platform
all this conspicuous consumption be as strategic as it be materialistic
it be a way for newly wealthy creoles in this context spaniards bear in the americas and people of indigenous ancestry bar from important church and government position because_they be not bear in spain to thumb their nose at the spanish crown
dignitary from spain who visit one of these home would see potent reminder of the new world 's natural resource
they would also at time see spanish americans assert their_own noble lineage in genealogy or portrait of inca royalty paint in a european style
one such painting of 14 inca king hang at the exhibition 's entrance next to goya 's 1806 painting of don tadeo bravo de rivero a peruvian who edge his way into spain 's chivalric order through military service
one of the few creole able_to do so he flaunt the cross and jeweled badge of the spanish order of santiago
as these example suggest obsession with race bloodline and birthplace some particular to the spanish colony others more widespread haunt
behind closed doors
visitor be constantly confront with family tree and other more or less hereditary claim to power
title could be purchase but the buyer first have to prove noble ancestry and a purity of blood a phrase that effectively mean people of jewish or moorish descent need not apply
also on view be casta painting that employ a rigid racial classification system one be call from spanish and indian mestizo and show a spanish man and his indigenous wife with their mestizo or mixed race baby
here too be work that be not_quite casta painting but seem closely related such as the group portrait free woman of color with their child and servant in a landscape by agostino brunias an italian work in the british colony
the painting be not as progressive as it sound it reinforce colonial hierarchy of race and class by surround its fashionable young heroine one of the free woman of the title with dark skin attendant who may well be her slave
in some of the decorative artwork at_least culture mix and mingle freely and without the need for taxonomy
a highlight be a large folding screen that once grace the viceregal palace in mexico_city
one side show battle scene base_on dutch print from the great turkish war the other depict a hunt party model on those in gobelins tapestry
both have be render by mexican artist in a traditional shell inlay technique know as enconchado on an object the six panel screen long associate_with asia
and in various place throughout the show the museum 's european art curator richard aste juxtapose spanish colonial art and furniture with similar object from the british colony
in do so as he note in the catalog he be continue a dialogue from a 1999 installation in the museum 's american paintings gallery
viewer of behind close door may also want_to visit interwoven globe the worldwide textile trade 1500 1800 which have a similar cross colonial frisson at the metropolitan_museum of art
it_' a lively one especially when portrait go head to head miguel cabrera 's stern 1760 painting of a wealthy creole doã±a marã­a de_la luz padilla y gã³mez de cervantes for_instance versus john singleton copley 's steely 1772 depiction of abigail pickman gardiner marry to the wealthy boston landowner sylvester gardiner
see them together let you compare and contrast the fashion and beauty trend particular to their respective colony doã±a marã­a 's face be dot with chiqueadores or glue on beauty mark while mrs. gardiner wear a billowy costume ã la turque of a salmon color robe over green harem pant
behind close door offer an_intimate look_at the life of colonial woman
we come to know some of them like doã±a marã­a through their formal portrait others like the wealthy indigenous landowner marã­a angela cachicatari through private painting and object in their possession
a large and fascinating section of the show recreate the estrado a parlorlike area of the home where woman pass much of the day socializing drink yerba mate and do needlework while sit cross legged on floor cushion
these glimpse of the good life and enough decorative installation to fill many an interior designer 's inspiration board be what_we expect from a show on the home of the wealthy
but in this exhibition the severity of colonial subjugation be just as visible and in the end more affect

in her essay article of faith sept. 1 dara horn be quite right in state that in judaism faith itself be largely build on the concept of preserve memory
we celebrate the power of memory not just on rosh hashana the day of remembrance but on all the holiday when we recall the exodus from egypt as_well as the entrance of our ancestor into the promised land the various harvest of the crop and even the creation of the world on the sabbath
moreover four time a year we recall loved one go but not forget at the yizkor memorial service

dara horn 's clever meditation on jewish memory while a delight to read leave the impression that jews be distinct in their piety to history
this be nonsense
religious holiday mark allege historical event from easter to ramadan as much as jews stand again at sinai
such commemoration cut both way
serbian nationalist evoke century old battle against the turks to justify hostilities against muslims and protestants march in northern ireland to commemorate victory_over catholics
a variety of religious community be urge not to forget in order to justify present political decision
jews today fret about the pogrom of passover past but orthodox west_bank settler also reimagine palestinians as enemy from the biblical amalek to nazis
preserve memory often through misremembering can be as dangerous as it can be pious

but psychoanalyst be very well acquainted with the intergenerational transmission of trauma
the child and we be now discover the grandchild and great_grandchild of holocaust survivor be seriously wounded people
they can certainly heal but scar always remain

the acting be wooden the set amateurish the writing banal the pace erratic
moreover ms. parnes use a digital program that turn photographic reality into a hallucinogenic cartoon as richard linklater do in his brilliant film wake life and a scanner darkly
but in ms. parnes 's case the trippy effect come off as crude and garish
the whole thing look_like it be make by an enterprising but not exceptionally talented high_school student
know it to be actually a sophisticated spoof make no difference
i wonder how i be go to get through an hour of it
after a while however it begin to seem interestingly bad
then it become mysteriously fascinate
i could_not stop watch
the plot of what ms. parnes 's web_site describe as a web base episodic digital film be complicated
set in a wealthy gate community county down revolve_around the invention and distribution of a psychedelic drug deliver and consume in nippled baby bottle by a teenage girl name angel
for unclear reason her parent and those of her friend be go insane
there be zombie cannibalism and murder include a matricidal decapitation

alexander and bonin 132 10th avenue near west 18th street chelsea through_oct. 12 distinctive enough to capture major attention but too diverse to be readily brand the german artist michael buthe have a substantial european career in the 1970 and 80 but fade from view after his_death at 50 in 1994
more recently interest in him have be increase abroad and alexander and bonin who_represent a somewhat similar artist paul thek continue to be mr. buthe 's new_york champion with a third solo show
mr. buthe like mr. thek be gay roman_catholic and seek source for art outside his_own culture
he be well enough establish in his 20 to be include in the legendary 1969 exhibition when attitude become forms
a year_later he first visit morocco and in 1972 spend nearly five month there in the beguiling seaside city of essaouria
its high color building and cornucopian souk cast a spell that saturate his art which move from quasi minimalism to orientalist hippie environment to small exuberant picture that bring sigmar polke a fellow art school_student as_well as paul klee to mind
there_' a nice suite of such work upstairs at alexander and bonin though the main show consist primarily of three large piece
the 1985 landscape spanish energy a dense assemblage incorporate a pitchfork brocade and the image of a star eye find mr. buthe in a theatrical mode while a pair of 15-foot long abstract triptych painting recall his minimalist root
the two triptych share a title the last secret of fatima a reference to a reported appearance in portugal in 1917 of the virgin mary to three child to whom she entrust three secret
two be make public in the 1940 and the third after heated speculation in 2000
both picture be compose of two monochromatic panel blue in one painting red in the other cover with all over pattern of tiny star and join by a third vertical panel in silver and gold
the result suggest blank icon yayoi kusama dot painting with hinge and stereoscopic view of intergalactic space
they_'re lovely

although heavy handed in its symbolism joanna malinowska 's late solo be a high spirited exploration of the north american frontier and its us and abuse by modernist artist
mix sculpture video and performance it make clever theatrical use of a space that ' cavernous by lower_east side standard
the main component be a six ton pile of dirt truck in from the yukon territory which nod obliquely to work by robert smithson and walter de maria but be mainly a set for a performance
visit the gallery at the right time and you may see ms. malinowska pan for gold
nearby be another set this one derive_from isamu noguchi 's austere design for the martha graham/aaron copland ballet appalachian spring
title bootleg noguchi ms. malinowska 's version substitute a crooked tree branch for the original production 's rectilinear wood frame
on video a russian composer read aloud from allen ginsberg 's poem america his strong accent and deadpan manner work against the ranting verse
this piece be not subtle and neither be the giant papier mã¢che bear model on roadside monument in the yukon that tower over the gallery but both have a role to play in the polish bear ms. malinowska 's affectionate skewering of cold_war era pioneer myth
maccarone 630 greenwich street at morton street west_village through_oct. 19 the protean carol bove continue to cultivate her extraordinary garden operate in the gap_between art and design modernism especially minimalism and nature language and structure find and make order and chaos her work/art and other people 's work/art
one of the best artist of our peculiar moment ms. bove start with appropriation sculpture consist of shelf display wear carefully choose paperback on often arcane metaphysical subject
here this opposition be manifest in a large sheet of glass suspend between i beam and flank by two column of the gallery it serve_as an immense frame for a small gordian knot of a painting design for the qor corporation by the polymath artist and kabbalist harry smith
it be also implicit in the inclusion of a vitrine of eccentric geometric drawing by and from the archive of lionel ziprin and joanne ziprin who form the mystically incline geometry obsess qor corporation also a tile business with mr. smith
the grid be a living grow thing in ms. bove 's universe
it be present here as fragmentary and possibly mutate in a low lie structure of small perpendicular i beam
it be definitely elegantly mutate in peel 's foe not a set animal laminate a tone of sleep two concrete block that form a seven foot monolith the upper one eat away by a metastasizing grid of shiny brass
her white tubular glyph sculpture while all curve imply infinite extension in their_own way while breathe new gently irreverent life into generic public art abstraction
the molecular metabolic nature of the grid be signal by the inclusion of a sculptural and mathematical feat from 1976 by richard berger the top surface of his couch iterate in small lead pellet suspend from micro filament
it also seem implicit in the monumental piece of petrified tree trunk that ms. bove have attach with only six bolt to a tall i beam where it resemble a torso a broken column and its former self
as if this be not enough ms. bove and philip smith a rare book dealer have organize a dense exhibition about the qor corporation in maccarone 's project space at 98 morton street
it contain more drawing by mr. smith and the ziprins and much_more study and prototype for tile in which geometry truly lose its mind and gain the universe
meanwhile the title of ms. bove 's show say a_lot ra or why be an orange like a bell
it flag her work as relational aesthetic at its most profound and inclusive and flippantly posit the unity of natural and artificial form with a riddle from batman 's foe the riddler
answer they both have to be peel or peal
this show be endless

the victorian pastime of flower press look decidedly contemporary in virginia poundstone 's late solo which make it difficult to separate nature and artifice art and craft and maybe even the quick and the dead
here crush botanical also link several medium digital photography monochrome painting and glass and bronze sculpture
in a series of wall base work for_instance ms. poundstone have print image of floral bouquet on perforated vinyl and then sandwich the fabric between glass leave many fold and crease that do_not conform to our expectation of the botanical still life
even more confounding be the sculpture small nubby look bronze with pour glass accent
identify as fossil they be cast from plaster impression of flower petal and rest on stack cardboard press in lieu of traditional pedestal
the different material volume and sculptural technique make you think_about the structural complexity of a live blossom and the difficulty of preserve it
the painting gold rush and high roller which cover small wooden panel with uniform arrangement of silky yellow petal be the most conventional work here
their title however be suggestive they bring to mind the 17th century dutch phenomenon of tulipmania as_well as more current form of economic speculation
and they round out this sometimes cerebral show with a burst of color and texture that ' intensely gratifying however long it last
thomas erben gallery 526 west 26th street fourth_floor chelsea through_oct. 26 bear in tehran in 1982 barbad golshiri be part_of a generation of young iranian artist who work primarily at home be distance themselves from the easy exoticism that sell well abroad
at the same_time they_'re try_to make art that ' critically responsive to contemporary iran and to a political culture that oppose on ideological ground much of what they_'re do
mr. golshiri 's tough wiry second new_york solo be make up of sculptural grave marker most of them in the horizontal format of muslim tombstone
at_least one piece directly subvert the traditional model
call pentimento it_' a flat rectangle of black iron pierce with a cluster of stakelike upright and carry a heretical inscription the customary arabic invocation there be no god but allah reduce to two word no god
other piece be dedicate to political martyr

another memorial design for a dissident who have be officially deny a tombstone consist of a stencil cut of a funerary inscription that can be temporarily but repeatedly apply to the site of the grave
the show a collaboration_with aaran art_gallery in tehran include tribute to western artist and writer jan van eck samuel beckett
mr. golshiri hold dear as_well as a marker for himself which look_like a work in progress
surely its existence be premature but in the context of work about the politics of death the message be be ready you never know
few wine notion be toss around as frequently and as randomly as balance
often it_' state axiomatically as in good wine must be balance
who can argue with that
sometimes it_' use as a rationalization as when speak of ultrahigh alcohol wine alcohol be just a number
it do_not matter as long as the wine be balance
i take issue with that statement
alcohol manifest itself in many way beyond a feeling of heat on the palate
it affect the texture the body and naturally the physical effect of a wine
balance be just a small part_of that overall equation
i have be think_about balance since the wine panel not long_ago taste 20 bottle of red bierzo from castilla y leã³n in northwestern spain just east of galicia
bierzo be one region that have help usher in the exciting modern era of spanish wine
the primary red grape mencã­a can make wine range_from light and pretty to dense and structured yet always with beguiling exotic aroma of wild red fruit
the style depend_on the intent of the winemaker of course but also importantly on where the grape be grow
those on terraced slate hillside for_example tend_to be more concentrated and complex than those from clay base soil on the flatlands
we have taste bierzos several_time over the last eight_year
in the past we have be thrill by the unusual quality of these wine and by our own sense of discovery
we have observe bierzo an ancient wine region yet new to the world of international wine commerce as it navigate the intricacy of global business waver between a desire to appeal to establish popular taste and a devotion to what make the wine distinctive in the first place
in our late tasting we saw a region that have move past the thrill of the new though eight_year may feel_like an eternity to modern attention span it be nothing in agricultural year
it be still grapple with issue of stylistic identity as_well as with current economic reality
bierzo estate have come and go in the american marketplace where consumer have perhaps gravitate more to the more delicate wine of ribeira sacra also make primarily of mencã­a across the border in galicia
while these big issue remain we be more_concerned with the basic winemaking issue of balance
we certainly encounter wine that we like very_much but we be also strike by the number of wine that do_not seem to conform to that axiomatic definition of a good wine
for the tasting florence fabricant and i be join by gil avital the wine director at tertulia in greenwich_village and jill roberts wine director of the marrow in the west_village
how do you perceive balance
partly you_can sense it when each individual element in a wine fruit tannin alcohol and acidity be in proportion so that no_one element dominate or be noticeable by its absence
but balance have a figurative element as_well
a truly balance wine will have tension and energy as with german riesling that walk a tightrope between cloy sweetness and mouth parch acidity thrill as they teeter back and forth or great champagne that crackle with a vivacity that demand another sip
the flavor of a wine must also be in balance as with the push pull between bitter and sweet so typical of many italian red
this in particular be where we find too_many of the bierzo wine in our tasting fall_short
we love the aromatic fruitiness of these wine but quite a few show an off put bitter quality that be out of proportion to the other element
what may have cause such a disjointedness
i can only speculate but i would guess that either the grape be not properly ripe at harvest or the wine be overwork in the cellar as producer try_to manipulate or eke out of the wine more intensity than it have to offer
it really depend_on where mencã­a grow gil say
it_' get to have balance but it_' hard to handle properly like pinot noir
though we be perhaps more aware of the miss our tasting have its hit as_well like our no 1 wine the 2010 vico from raãºl perez
mr. perez be one of the superstar winemaker in northwestern spain and his wine always show great purity and definition
this wine be burly than his more graceful ribeira sacra wine an excellent example of mencã­a make in a slightly warm climate with fruit flavor buttress by mineral and oak accent
yes it be beautifully balance and it will reward a few more year of aging
at $_35 this be one of mr. perez 's more modestly price wine
other cuvees can soar past $ 90 or $_100 1_2 next_page

but it be inconclusive on the question of how_much of the steal crude be export and how_much be process in operation in the nigerian swamp
the bush refining business be highly decentralized and secretive it say which make its size hard to estimate
mr. ribadu 's report give a high possible figure for the scale of daily theft 250,000 barrel but the chatham_house document emphasize the unreliability of figure from government and oil_company
mr. ribadu suggest in strong term than the more recent document that the problem be grow note_that shell claim a fivefold increase in loss between 2009 and 2012 from 10,000 barrel per day to 50,000 in march of last_year
chatham_house by_contrast say that outsider should look closely at claim that nigeria be lose oil at unheard of rate add that the high divergence in industrywide estimate make it hard to gauge trend reliably
no american president be more improbable than thomas woodrow wilson
none better embody how we like to think of ourselves in the great world
a princeton university president and political economy professor give to make high minded speech and advocate a parliamentary system wilson hold no public office until he be 54 year old
recruit to run for governor of new_jersey in 1910 by a democratic machine bos who think he would be easily control the prof school the pro in practical politics pass a reform agenda that curb the power of party and corporation alike
after deal_with college politician he gibe i find that the man with whom i be deal_with now seem_like amateur
adroitly rid the progressive wave break over the country wilson take the presidency two_year later only the second democrat to capture the white_house since the civil_war
he possess a rare instinct for power and how to use it
once in washington he put his theory to the test audaciously choose to rule more as a prime_minister than a traditional chief_executive
within 10 month he have pass a progressive agenda that have be stall for a generation slash tariff rate that protect monopoly pass the first permanent federal income tax and create the federal_reserve system to end the bank panic that continually ravage the american economy
more reform to bolster antitrust law discourage child labor and inaugurate the eight hour day and worker_compensation follow
handsome and charismatic wilson be our first modern president hold regular news_conference complain_about have to live in washington and delight in popular distraction like baseball game detective story golf and especially the new move picture
he adore woman and have remarkably modern partnership with them share every aspect_of his work and his idea with his_wife ellen and after she die with his second wife edith
he also have a longtime and apparently platonic female friend
a. scott berg tell the story of wilson the man very well indeed
the author of four previous prizewinning best sell biography he have a novelist 's eye for the striking detail and a vivid prose style
he be on less sure footing when it come to wilson the statesman
too_often he rely_on shoddy source that distort the historical record
the black death recur frequently but it do_not last for 400 year
henry cabot lodge be not a right-â­winger the royal navy do_not take a timorous approach to german u boat and winston churchill do_not believe_that america should have mind its_own business and stay out of the world_war
berg give us little on the vital economic debate of the progressive era and only a perfunctory comparison of wilson 's new freedom and teddy roosevelt 's new nationalism
there be barely a mention of the pujo committee 's investigation_into our financial system which make many of wilson 's reform possible and no attempt_to assess the long_term effect of these reform
he do better on issue like woman 's right and especially race
wilson a virginia native steep in the lore of the lost cause stuff his cabinet full of bigoted southern mediocrity who cruelly segregate federal office cafeteria and washroom for the first_time
when a black journalist and wilson supporter william monroe trotter protest too persistently the president order him out of his office
both his temper and his injudicious selection of adviser be indicative of flaw that would come to devour his presidency
wilson attract some of the most talented figure in american political history to his administration and his cause franklin roosevelt louis brandeis herbert hoover walter lippmann and bernard baruch among_others but
too_often he fail to delegate well routinely write his_own speech and even type his_own policy paper
absolute loyalty be value over candor
again and again wilson break with his close associate when he feel they have betray him 1_2 next_page

for the player who have reject two propose contract one that would have cut their salary by a third another by a quarter the lobby itself cost some $_30 million have become a symbol
though money be raise specifically for the renovation project the player cast the lobby expenditure as a misappropriation of fund that may better be direct toward their remuneration and welfare
the lockout which begin last oct._1 and wipe_out an entire season of concert now jeopardize the start of another which be to include four concert of sibelius at carnegie hall conduct_by osmo vanska the orchestra 's music director
it also jeopardize mr. vanska 's_tenure since he have threaten to resign if the first two carnegie concert in early november be cancel

magdeburg germany when chancellor_angela merkel make an hourlong campaign stop in this town in the former east germany this_week ilse siegert be determined not to miss her chance
a descendant of an impoverished noble family who land here in the chaos of 1945 ms. siegert 74 have see her share of german history
for more_than a decade she have campaign for better benefit for retiree and others she think be not get their fair share from the german state
so she_say she buttonhole ms._merkel as she work the crowd of about 1,500 on_tuesday and demand to know_what the chancellor plan to do about the issue
ms._merkel shake her hand and smile she_say
before the election they all want_to know us ms. siegert say
after the election no_one know us at all
she_say she may vote for ms._merkel on_sunday when the chancellor hop to win a third_term but be still consider shun the election altogether
ms._merkel 59 a train physicist spend her first 35_year in the communist east so she may be consider one of us in these part_of germany by the political and other elite who like to talk at_least publicly of the blossom new state
but she may also have an uphill battle to win over eastern germans who feel shortchanged by capitalism nearly a quarter_century after the fall of the berlin wall
part_of the former east particularly southern region around leipzig and dresden have flourish
but in place like magdeburg a 1,000-year old town with germany_'s old gothic cathedral a renowned university and some very soviet look building that replace bomb ruin leave by the allies the present and future look less gleaming
in more_than a dozen conversation a visitor have with old resident at ms._merkel 's campaign stop at old market square talk turn quickly to their too meager pension and among young spectator to their abide indifference toward the chancellor
wage in the former east still tend_to be low than in the former west and while pension have even out many easterner rear on illusory view of western bounty still feel cheated
those_who have live in the west before the wall fall rarely grouse much anymore about how_much reunification cost estimate run around $ 2.7 trillion although some note occasionally that while the living condition of east german may have be miserable most go along_with communist rule for four_decade
eastern germany have far few people and vote to offer than the west but with poll show the race tighten in its final day ms._merkel find time to make her case here with her usual stump speech modify in an effort to appeal
we have no vote to give away she emphasize possibly the same thought that lead her to visit magdeburg and surround town after catastrophic flood this_summer
political loyalty in the former east germany with a population of roughly 15.5 million be split in the last federal election in_2009 between ms._merkel 's christian_democrats who win slightly less_than 30_percent of the vote and the far leave die linke which get just under 29 percent
the center leave social_democrats the no 2 party nationally come in a distant third with 18 percent
peer_steinbrã¼ck the social democrat who be ms._merkel 's main challenger cause a stir in_august when he accuse her of lack an_emotional affinity for europe something he attribute to her east german background
mr._steinbrã¼ck swiftly deny any intent to impugn all east germans whom he call hardworking enterprising people
but the backtracking fail to convince some include werner schulz a european_parliament member who be in germany_'s parliament for 15 year and a human_right activist in east germany
someone_who speak like mr._steinbrã¼ck be not worthy of become chancellor mr. schulz say
some of the warm applause ms._merkel receive from the crowd on_tuesday come when she praise europe as a place in which freedom of speech religion the medium and association be guarantee
the line a stump speech staple resonate more here than in the west and to whistle heckler she add the zinger that yes even in magdeburg there be no price to pay for disagree with her 1

bianco rosso wine bar and restaurant in wilton which open in_january 2012 do indeed serve italian food
but bianco rosso be not just another italian restaurant
it have style flair and a short compelling menu devise by jacob hamilton the chef who formerly work for todd english in new_york

top for creativity be an appetizer of king salmon tartare
a generous stack of chop fresh salmon speckle with shallot and fiery jalapeã±o rest on a bed of arugula with both black and pink peppercorn scatter on the plate a most attractive presentation
crunchy fried calamari another starter be serve in abundance along_with a mildly spice marinara dip
eggplant parmesan with prosciutto and mascarpone sound lovely
but the reality be not as fresh tasting or as exhilarating as the other starter
as for the prix_fixe entree we love the radiant freshness of the house make pea tortellini four or five pasta pillow fill_with sweet pea cook in brown butter with a tang of honey on a plate decorate with fresh pea shoot and tendril
another pasta dish fusilli combine roasted cauliflower garlic and olive_oil and radiate tantalizing aroma
it taste as good as it look but it need more olive_oil which our waiter willingly supply to moisten and enliven the dish
we also enjoy the pan_sear shrimp succulent jumbos in a swirl of lobster sauce and accompany_by a barley salad with pea mushroom and carrot
the pan_sear striped bass on the other_hand be a bit overcooked for my taste
it be team however with a refreshing barley asparagus salad jazz up with a tangy lemon vinaigrette
the regular ã la carte dinner menu also have some very_good choice generally well prepared
our dinner begin with excellent crusty focaccia serve gratis with first rate aria extra virgin olive_oil that have a few bead of olive tapenade float in it
among the first course we love the piping hot grilled squid exceedingly tender and fresh tasting with white cannellini bean and cherry tomato anchor in a luscious herb rich sauce
equally pleasing be the nicely brown crunchy top crab cake make with maryland lump crab meat which come alongside a flawlessly dress arugula salad with fresh tomato and a zesty cherry pepper sauce
crispy artichoke be another delight though the dress on the accompany green salad could have benefit_from a touch more vinegar
an entree of baked salmon arrive with an engaging potpourri of veggie pea green bean lima bean asparagus carrot spring onion and radish
another dish pan_sear red snapper be plat with a crisp risotto cake tomato ragã¹ mussel olive spinach and smoke sweet paprika oil
both fish order be expertly cook
dessert be few but two of those we try be noteworthy a warm brown sugary apple cobbler and tiramisã¹.
the pistachio gelato be to my taste a tad too sweet
lunch be the big value here but dinner can be festive and delicious
with most ã la carte entree top out in the low to mid-20 bianco rosso offer impressive cooking at mod price

accord_to vladimir nabokov salvador dalã­ be really norman rockwell 's twin brother kidnap by gypsy in babyhood
but actually there be triplet the third one be stephen_king
the rockwell small_town rock chair the old_fashioned house with the welcome mat the genial family doctor the grandfather clock there they be depict in all their lifelike apparently cozy detail
both rockwell and king know such detail intimately right down to the brand name
but there_' something very very wrong
the rock chair be come to get you
the family doctor be greenish in hue and have be dead for some time
the house be haunt and the welcome mat be alive with thing
and pace dalã­ the clock be melt
doctor_sleep pick_up on the story of danny the little boy with psycho intuitive power in king 's famous 1977 novel the shining
danny survive both his evil infested dad jack torrance and the ghoul that inhabit the grisly overlook hotel in colorado escape by the hair of his chinny chin chin just before the clock strike midnight and the hotel 's infernal boiler blow_up incinerate the force of bad and leave reader hide under the bed but cross eye with relief
in doctor_sleep dan have grow_up but he retain his shin ability
have wrestle the demon drink to an uneasy standstill his_father have that problem too as we recall he ' attend a.a. and work at a hospice facility where with his mind probe talent he help the die to reconcile themselves to their often misspent life
thus his nickname doctor_sleep which echo his childhood nickname doc
as in the what ' up of bugs bunny fame
what indeed
enter another magic child abra as in cadabra the text helpfully point_out who ' even better at the shin stuff than dan be
she alarm her parent early on by predict the 9/11 disaster while still in her crib and have since cause dismay by stick all the spoon to the ceiling during her birthday party
the two shiner soon find_themselves in spiritual communication which be a lucky thing because young abra be go to need big help
she be the target of a rackety entertaining bunch call the true knot who lust to drink her spiritual mist or steam
this be a whole new twist on steampunk
the knot member have be alive for a very long time not usually a good sign as those_who know their dracula and
she can testify and disguise as vacationer roam the countryside in rv they kidnap and torture their victim then imbibe their essence
they also bottle these in case of shortage for if_they run out of steam they evaporate leave their clothes behind like the wicked witch of the west when melt
they_'re lead by a beautiful woman name rose the hat whose main lover be a gent know as crow daddy
from crawdaddy we assume
king love wordplay and pun and mirror language remember redrum from the shin
who could forget
the name of king 's character be frequently appropriate daniel lions den anthony the tempt saint torrance it never rain but it pour be a case in point
rose be a sinister rosa mystica a negative version_of the virgin mary
for starter she be not no virgin
as for the overlook hotel on the site of which the true knotters have pitch their main encampment its name have at_least three layer the obvious one it look out over the landscape the semi obvious the bad folk overlook something and the deeply embed which i be guess have to do with the old song about the four leaf clover and the somebody i adore for king 's good and evil arrangement be usually yin and yang with a spot of darkness in every goodie and a tiny ray of sunshine in every baddie
even the true knotters be sweet with one another though their status as human being be dubious
as one new recruit say be i still human
and as rose reply do you care
wild ectoplasmic partly decayed vampire horse would not tear from me the story of what_happen next but let_me assure you king be a pro by the end of this book your finger will be mere stub of their former self and you will be look askance at the people in the supermarket line because if_they turn around they may have metallic eye

feisty young_woman chase around sweden track down killer be by no mean the only people with dragon tattoo on their flesh
the middle aged french canadian gallery owner at the center of robert lepage 's slight but move work the blue_dragon at the brooklyn_academy of music 's harvey theater through_sunday have a similar creature snake across his back an emblem of his reverence for chinese culture and his adopt home
mr._lepage most_famous or be that infamous
in new_york now for his controversial and expensive production of wagner 's ring for the metropolitan opera have a long career behind_him as a theater auteur he write direct and sometimes act in production for his ex machina company
the blue_dragon originally stag in_2009 be a small scale sequel of sort to his more epic five hour plus dragons trilogy from 1985
this show run an intermissionless hour and 50 minute and be perform in english french and mandarin with english supertitle
mr._lepage portray pierre lamontagne a central figure in the dragons trilogy whose life be take up 20_year after the end of that work
pierre have leave canada behind to forge a life in shanghai as a gallery owner his ambition to create art of his_own have be set_aside
his affair with a young chinese artist whose show he be present xiao ling tai wei foo hit a rough patch when a lover from his past claire forãªt marie michaud arrive in shanghai on a quest to adopt a baby
claire and pierre have reach point in their life at which decision make in their youth be circle back to haunt them and at which decision make now can involve momentous irreversible change
claire too have leave the art_world to become an advertising executive but now see the shelf life of her career shorten before her as young colleague keep apace with the disorient change in medium and culture
pierre 's life have suddenly become precarious the chinese authorities be plan to expropriate the property where he have long live along_with many other artist to build a train station
both mr._lepage and ms. michaud who together write the script for the blue_dragon give subdued delicate and emotionally resonant performance
we sense quickly how easily pierre and claire re establish their rapport while the question of what may have be between them they marry for mercenary purpose to gain more grant money and never divorce lingers quietly in the background like music just faintly hear
when claire 's bid to adopt go awry she feel herself even more at loose end but she strike up a friendship with xiao ling that lead to an_unexpected development
xiao ling have become pregnant they discover one day when an expedition to the zoo be interrupt by a bout of morning sickness
chinese cultural dictate make it difficult for single woman to raise child on their_own
could her unwanted baby be a stroke of happy fortune for claire
the blue_dragon move with the cinematic fluidity emblematic of much of mr._lepage 's work
i keep reflect that the production seem almost design for film
it open with movie style credit during which ms. tai dance in traditional costume before the screen on which the credit appear
and the action be mostly confine to a narrow two level strip of stage that give the show a kind_of two dimensional feeling as if we be watch the whole thing unfold on a screen
film may also amplify the impact of the performance
aside from a single scene of conflict in which pierre and claire trade recrimination and accusation after a tense night the blue_dragon rely_on minor key emotional development that the actor to their credit never overplay but that do_not necessarily register strongly enough to engage an audience in a large theater
i have the odd feeling that i be watch a quiet finely etch indie movie on an iphone and lose too_much of the detail
mr._lepage do supply some nifty directorial sleight of hand as when two white sheet slide slowly across the stage to indicate a thin layer of snowfall
and as always his integration of video imagery by david leclerc be seamless and sometimes witty
one interstitial segment appear to be an old style chinese martial art movie set in the legendary past until patty of fry chicken appear in the hand of the warrior it_' a chinese ad for kfc. the blue_dragon end on a movingly ambiguous note
earlier xiao ling tell claire the grim legend of how woman with unwanted baby once dispose of them by throw them into the yangtze river and let the three gorge decide their fate a new family death by drown or a return to the place_where they be abandon
evoke this legend mr._lepage and ms. michaud conclude the show by offer three provisional ending all plausible and rewarding on their_own term but each leave one of the three character wave a bittersweet goodbye to the other two suggest_that whatever the future hold someone will end_up abandon and alone

san_francisco kids
the reckless rant and picture they post online can often get them in trouble by compromise their chance of get into a good college or even land them in jail
what to do about such lapse vexes parent school official the internet company that host their word and image and the law
now california legislator be try_to solve the problem with the first measure in the country to give minor the legal right to scrub away their online indiscretion
the legislation put the state in the middle of a turbulent debate_over how best to protect child and their privacy on the internet and whether state should even be try_to tame the web
the governor jerry brown have take no position on the bill
he have until mid_october to sign it after which without his signature the legislation become law
california be often in the vanguard when it come to digital privacy
it be the first state to require company to report data breach and it require web_site and mobile apps to post privacy policy that explain_how personal_information be use
a recently pass law require web_site to tell user whether they honor browser do_not track signal
the right to delete or eraser provision be part_of a broad bill that prohibit web_site which have actual knowledge that a minor be use the site base_on a profile and activity on the site from run ad for a range of product include alcohol spray paint tattoo tanning bed and e cigarette
the eraser section compel online site to let user under 18 delete rant tweet picture status update and other material
although many company include facebook and twitter already offer this option to their user the california bill would make it a right across the internet for child who_live in that state
kid and teenager often self reveal before they self reflect say james steyer chief_executive of common_sense media a san_francisco base advocacy_group that push for the law
it_' a very_important milestone
the rash revelation by a texas teenager justin carter on facebook last february a threatened school shoot his_family insist be sarcastic make in the heat of play a video_game land him in a texas jail on a felony terrorism charge for nearly six_month
his_father jack favor the california legislation but wonder_if it would go far enough
they should be allow to delete it but then again be it really delete
mr. carter 39 of san_antonio say in an_interview this_week
also mr. carter say if his son have delete the conversation that someone report to the authorities would the deletion be see as destroy evidence
his son now 19 be out on a bond pending trial
any law try_to tame the internet he say be likely_to run into turbulence
it_' a whole new territory it grow fast than the law do mr. carter say
we_'re try_to come_up with thing to make it all neat
there_' collateral damage my_son be one of them
critic of an eraser law see pitfall
they warn_that in try_to protect child the law could unwittingly put them at risk by dig deeper into their personal life
to comply_with the law for_example company would have to collect more information_about their customer include whether they be under 18 and whether they be in california
there be also practical concern
if other state pass similar law company would be force to devise multiple policy for the underage resident of different state confuse consumer and create unwieldy requirement for web business that be essentially stateless except for issue like collect sale tax
the internet opponent of the law say should be regulate by a uniform set of rule not piecemeal by the state
this be well mean legislation but there be concern_about it say stephen balkam president of the family online safety institute which advise company like facebook and microsoft on online safety issue
mr. balkam say he favor congressional oversight in issue like child 's online privacy and if_necessary regulation by the federal trade commission
where california lead others follow he say
i_think it will be a mess
some supporter of the bill say internet company get off easy
the eraser bill do_not for_example require company to remove the delete data from its server altogether nor do it offer any way to delete material that have be share by others a sensational picture that have go viral in other_word can_not be purge from the internet
and it be nothing like the right to be forget measure that legislator in europe have be press for
that proposal_would at its core allow all europeans not just child to delete their online personal_information several amendment to the plan address freedom of expression concern
it_' an_important first step but there_' more to be do mr. steyer say
mr. steyer 's organization which participate_in a safety advisory group with facebook but soon leave after disagreement with the company 's approach have be push for more aggressive legislation
those effort in_2011 lead member of congress to propose a measure that would have allow parent to scrub material post by their child
criticize by free speech advocate the bill go nowhere though senator edward_j. markey democrat of massachusetts who be a co sponsor plan to introduce it again later this_year
short of federal privacy law in general state have be pass law on a host of privacy matter in many case follow california 's lead
often you need to comply_with the most restrictive state as a practical matter because the internet do_not really have state boundary say mali friedman a lawyer in the san_francisco office of covington burling a national law_firm
bank regulator around the world be force bank to hold more capital than they do before the financial_crisis reveal just how inadequate their capital truly be
but one set of american bank appear to be on the verge of keep the right to have no capital at all
that group be the money_market fund which function as bank but historically have have the best of all regulatory world no capital requirement no reserve no fee for deposit insurance and a belief by their customer that they be at_least as safe as bank
this_week the comment period close on proposed money_market rule set forth by the securities and exchange commission
the rule be pitifully weak and inadequate
they could even make the system more vulnerable in a crisis as the president of all 12 federal_reserve bank point_out in a letter to the s.e.c.
but that have not stop the mutual fund industry from try_to weaken them even more
by coincidence the deadline for comment be on_thursday just five day_after the fifth anniversary of the collapse of lehman brothers
it be that collapse that reveal to all just how shaky the money_market industry be
the answer be or ought to be remarkably simple they either have to be bank or mutual fund paul a. volcker the former federal_reserve chairman tell_me in an_interview
if_they be bank promise to pay at par on demand they should be regulate like bank
if_they be mutual fund they should be regulate like mutual fund
but such a sensible proposal_would outrage the money_market fund industry which have lobby politician intensely
it be perhaps the big embarrassment of mary schapiro 's_tenure as chairwoman of the s.e.c. that she be unable_to persuade a majority of commissioner to propose any reform of the industry
so her successor mary jo white be praise when she manage to get the commission to unanimously put out the two rule for comment
surely something be better_than nothing
well in this case perhaps not
one proposed rule call for allow the net asset value of money_market fund to fluctuate
currently fund price their share at $_1 round to the near penny and promise they will remain there
in practice that mean that as long as the value remain at or above 99.5 cent the fund will not break the buck
the s.e.c. proposal_would stretch that round out to the near hundredth of a penny
but the s.e.c. proposal_would not actually do very_much
fund that invest primarily in government security would not face a float net asset value
nor would so_call retail money_market fund which allow investor to withdraw no more_than $_1 million at a time
even those few fund that would be subject to the rule would be_able to use an exist s.e.c. rule that usually let_them assume market price be equal to par value for any security that will mature within 60 day
the fact_that the proposal_would do little have not stop the industry from complain
fund company want_to change the definition of retail fund
some suggest raise the limit to $_5 million
others say that as long as the investor have a social_security number the fund should be deem retail
the other s.e.c. proposal set_up an elaborate procedure that would allow but not require money_market fund that have experience a_lot of redemption to either impose a fee on redemption or to simply suspend such payment for 30 day
this be call the gate proposal because it erect gate to protect fund
and what be the virtue of that
well it would prevent or at_least delay a run on any fund that get in trouble
if protect the fund and not its investor be the top priority maybe that make_sense
but in reality it probably would do more harm than good
as eric s. rosengren the president of the federal_reserve bank of boston write in a letter sign by all the other regional fed president a fund could run low on liquidity and thus initiate the gate proposal if a couple of large investor in the fund withdraw their money for any reason
that could scare investor in other fund that seem similar in some way produce more run and more gate
as this represent a new run mechanism that do_not exist under the status_quo the fee and gate alternative may actually increase run risk relative to not enact further reform mr. rosengren write
to much of the industry there be no problem at all

before the metamorphosis arthur pita 's dance theater adaptation of franz kafka 's novella officially begin the stage tell a story
on one side be a kitchen where a mother dry silverware a father hunch over a newspaper and a pigtailed daughter lie on the floor check her homework
on the other be edward watson recumbent in bed with a white sheet pull up to his chest
eerily his body seem trap
even as he lift his head off the pillow and slowly roll it side to side he remain otherwise still
in the metamorphosis which be see wednesday at the joyce theater a travel salesman wake_up to find that he have be transform into a gruesome insect
like kafka 's character mr. watson 's gregor samsa be oddly matter of fact about his predicament he also never completely part with his humanity even as his parent and eventually grete his young sister accept the transformation with equal part acceptance and revulsion
set to an ominous score by frank moon who can go overboard with his insect in the night vocalization the metamorphosis feature impressive visual design simon daw 's set which feature a move wall contrast_between the grotesque creature with its sterile surroundings
dark brown sludge seep out of gregor 's mouth eventually turn his bedroom into a streaky mudslide that conjure a blood soak carrie
if only there be more tension in mr. pita 's increasingly long wind production which open the joyce theater 's fall season and be originally produce_by the royal ballet in_2011
much care be devote to gregor 's pre insect existence in which his routine be establish he rise from bed dress put an apple in his bag and catch a train
here mr. watson 's precision be unflinching
but the transformation from salesman to insect be more abrupt than macabre
even worse be the sense that this insect have study yoga
it do_not matter what a pair of long leg be do there be still no place in the metamorphosis for a shoulder stand
still mr. watson a celebrated royal ballet principal possess a spindly ranginess that be affect especially as he use his joint to etch razor sharp angle
roll on his back he extend his leg in the air and point and flex his toe
thread an arm in between his thigh and wrap it around the outside of his calf he curve his spine in a deep contraction without lose his strange define prickliness
duet with his_mother nina goldman and grete corey annand be more obvious often they expose little more_than partner mechanic
grete an aspire ballerina in this version struggle to straighten gregor 's leg and arm but he be slinkyesque
there_' no way to stretch him back into a man
mr. watson 's gregor have more to do with spirit than the knotting and unknotting of muscle
when it work the struggle be internal confusion yearning and despondency be nakedly reveal in his forlorn eye
david hallberg would be good in this would not he
for all its predictability gregor samsa be still a meaty role for a ballet dancer it_' a chance to get down and dirty
the metamorphosis continue through_sept. 29 at the joyce theater 175 eighth avenue at 19th street chelsea 212

if_you want an interesting perspective on a police procedural watch it with a real police_officer
if_you want insight_into the accuracy of a medical drama watch it with a doctor
it_' too bad there be no late-14th- or early-15th century british king around with whom to watch the hollow crown a four part serving of shakespeare that begin on_friday on pbs 's great performances
think of the question you could ask do you guy really make a habit of spout eloquent eulogy and speech at improbable time
be there really practically no woman in england then except mrs. weasley from the harry potter movie
do king ever do any actual governing or do they just fight and fret about who be or be not try_to unseat them of course your pestering may just earn you a beheading which seem to have be the method prefer by king and would be king of yore for make annoyance go away
a couple of head be graphically lop off in richard_ii
friday 's opening installment of the series which also include on successive friday henry_iv part 1 henry_iv part 2 and henry v.
those tumble head be worth note
first let_'s get this caveat out of the way nothing beat a stage performance of a shakespeare play if the cast be first rate and the direction insightful
that say a television or film treatment can be helpful especially for the uninitiated and especially for these play which be not as_well know or audience friendly as say romeo and juliet
when a full battle be call for you see a battlefield with horse and army
when a chorus recitation be demand it be recite by john hurt over footage of a ship at sea embark_on a cross channel invasion
and when head must be sever pity poor bushy and green in richard_ii the director rupert goold have the option of show you the unpleasant act and he take it
shakespeare have it occur offstage
there be bloody moment in the hollow crown but not gratuitously so
these be high stake play and graphically render death underscore that in a way that a stage production ca n't
for the most part the flexibility that television provide be use to good advantage in the hollow crown to clarify the action and enhance the dynamic
only occasionally do it feel misplaced as in richard_ii when mr. goold go all in with jesus imagery
to have richard view himself as a christ figure be fine but here it seem more the director 's choice than the king 's
group the four play together provide the chance for a study in kingly contrast and the actor and director provide it
jeremy irons among the most familiar cast member to american audience in these british production be henry_iv in the middle two play direct_by richard eyre and give you pretty_much what you would expect from mr. irons solidity fury precision
most interesting be ben whishaw 's airy effeminate richard_ii a character who can_not seem to decide_whether to be protective of his power or indifferent to it
richard 's best speech come late in the play as he be lose his grip on both reality and his throne to the advance henry bolingbroke rory kinnear who the next time we meet him have turn_into king henry_iv and mr. irons
prince hal eventually to be henry v be play by tom hiddleston who ably transition_from the devil may care fellow of henry_iv part 1 to the serious monarch of henry v direct_by thea sharrock
he may not make anyone forget kenneth branagh 's 1989 film portrayal just as this henry v as a whole do_not outshine that one but he have his moment especially the scene from henry_iv part 1 in which he kill hotspur and then pronounce one of those incongruously move spur of the moment epitaph
there be character other than king in these play of course among_them julie walters of the harry potter film as mistress
quickly one of the few female role of any size
the most beloved be surely falstaff and simon russell beale have great fun with the role make the portly fellow feel_like a person rather_than a mere buffoon

let_'s pick this up next time
if the gentleman host be unhappy with the earlier than he desire departure of dinner guest he will admonish his fiancee in private i hope to keep her eye open longer
and if your husband have load more to discuss with his pal reciprocate quickly
or let the two of them meet up for lunch
but stay put while your hostess be pass out seem irremediably awkward not to mention creepy
do_not take her nodding off as any negative judgment about you
she may be tired especially if she do a full day 's work then cook a fancy dinner

my feeling have evolve from amused to annoyed and insult
be i be oversensitive
anonymous newburyport mass.
of course not
as jim croce sing approximately four_million year_ago like the pine tree line the wind road you get a name you get a name
and your in law owe it to you to pronounce it correctly
let_'s assume they start out flummox by it which over time turn to fear and denial and your sporadic attempt at remedial education have be insufficient
this may be kind than they deserve but you have not sketch out any_other cruelty so we will keep to the sunny side of the street
the next time you be all together sit_down with your husband and tell them listen it_' be a decade and it_' not that hard a name
then do a call and response repetition until even the tiny child can pull it off without a hitch
go big and go home a victor
it_' worth the effort
we all learn to pronounce zach galifianakis correct
recropping the photos
my amazing guy and i have be together for 10_year and marry for 2
but his ex wife continue to package photograph of the good old day include romantic moment between them and have them deliver by their 20-year old_daughter

anonymous vancouver keep quiet about the whole business
it be none of your concern and your husband be handle it
and for the record i would be just as jealous and upset as you

the puck building the inimitable epicenter of soho industrial swank even before there be a soho have be around for 128 yearsâ but defy its age with the tenacity of an uptown socialite
all it take be good bone structure ton of money and a win personality the first supply by henry baerer 's two saucy statue of shakespeare 's mischievous puck on the building 's exterior the last by the genius of the puck 's original architect albert wagner
the essential contemporary attribute in the middle a bottomless bankroll be traceable to jared kushner 32 a scion of the family that own the puck
it_' a gorgeous magical building mr._kushner say but i_want it to become the most incredible that it could be let it realize its full potential
the truth be that a_lot of old building if_they 're not properly invest in become tired old building
i_want to take an icon and not just preserve it but improve it
he ' be at it for eight_year and in_2011 survive a three_month tussle with the landmarks preservation commission to consolidate his mission mr._kushner saw the puck 's future and it be penthouse
after rule out a rooftop boutique hotel or restaurant he opt to take the luxury condominium route as the most appropriate mode of ratchet up the puck 's relevance to the 21st_century downtown real_estate market
he be now crown the already regal building with six loft style residence to be call the puck penthouses
five will replace what have be disused office space on the eighth and ninth floor with a sixth to be build on the roof
they have their_own private entrance behind a puck blue door at 295 lafayette street an elegant lobby with a cast_iron fireplace import from europe and an amusing stain glass caricature of puck by the elevator
mr._kushner come_up with that novel but expensive decor enhancer while tour church in prague with his_wife ivanka trump
he have a hard time not think_about work
each home be configure differently one be finish and all be intend as artisanal masterworks right down to their limit edition la cornue stove from france bullet shape h. theophile door hinge and custom kolbe mahogany frame window with build in uv protection for art and furniture
mr._kushner rip out the window he originally commission after decide they be not picture perfect
cherished holdover from yesteryear include flute iron column ash insulation and brick barrel vault ceiling circa 1885
i_realize very early on that while it_' still relatively early in my overall career there be a really good chance that i would never again have an opportunity to work on a project this unique say mr._kushner who spend at_least three day a week on the construction site and be not shy about scold anyone_who forget to put dust slipper over his or her shoe before enter pristine no
ph vi roman numeral be so_much more imperial than regular old number
there a site supervisor he nickname mariano_rivera be in charge of put the finishing touch on a 4,895-square foot three bedroom four and a half bath residence price at $ 21 million
its opulent 1,600-square foot master suite overlook another downtown landmark the basilica of st. patrick 's old cathedral and picturesque cemetery
it_' always nice to know you will have quiet neighbor mr._kushner say
the penthouse of which only ph vi be market ready range_from $ 21 million to $ 60 million two will be duplex three will have outdoor space and three overlook a roof garden
whether mr._kushner 's taste and vision turn_out to be tailor make for the luxury downtown marketplace have yet to be determine but pamela liebman the president of the corcoran group be impressed after a recent tour
this be what everybody think a loft in soho should look_like but can never find she_say add there_' so_much money out there now chase large apartment
i_think anyone_who live there be go to feel important

they do_not make them like this anymore genteel old_fashioned restaurant with beautiful tile and intricate carefully maintain mural frame by rich dark wood with enough space among table that conversation can remain private where music do_not boom and blare where service be calm and patron unrushed
aquario be such a place
that may explain_why even_though the kitchen have its ups and down the restaurant have enjoy two_decade across the road from silver lake in west harrison
one recent weekend evening two of the party room be take and the main dining_room call the tagus river room fill up quickly
the mural depict such a sunny idyllic life on the river and among the grapevine that we wonder about book a seat on the next flight to lisbon
today 's diet have catch_up with what aquario have be serve since its inception seafood and a luscious variety of seasonal vegetable
but before the main course nibble on a few black olive or slice of linguiã§a a salty portuguese sausage tasty treat that may go with say a lime load caipirinha a fruity sangria or a husky portuguese red
a simple arugula and radicchio salad with forgettable french and astringent avocado dressing on the side and the caldo verde an overly salt soup with grainy potato could easily be give the go by
better starter be to come like cool sweet honeydew overlay with prosciutto and two small smooth squid stuff with a mince of vegetable and shrimp and bath in a shallow pool of sheer tomato sauce
good bread make handy sop for this and other sauce like the sweet garlic that come with tender broil octopus
the snail in cognac sauce be say to be a favorite first course here and we can understand_why even_if they be an odd entry on the menu at aquario which describe itself as a portuguese and brazilian restaurant
serve over perfectly cook linguine they make an ultrarich and delectable dish
the generous dose of cognac in the pale tomato cream sauce deliver a heady aroma and taste
the decent green new_zealand mussel lack balance however flood by a nonetheless tasty spread of thick semi molten cut of tomato onion and colorful sweet pepper
entree have their high and low as_well
portuguese stew be a personal favorite but here it may be better to stick with those that exclude pork like mariscada or the fisherman 's rice stew with shellfish
one stew do in the style of the alentejo region of portugal include cube of dry lean pork which detract from the goodness of the clam and cilantro rich wine sauce carry this dish
they do the same for an otherwise win paelha which be heap with good seafood chicken and saffron rice
less intricate fish preparation be more successful
serve with a brown butter sauce on the side whole dover sole be saute perfectly as be a thick cut of moist swordfish cover with soft luscious balsamic onion
firm and meaty monkfish receive the restaurant 's_signature medley of fresh tomato onion and sweet pepper
but still too tough and salty the bacalao salt cod could have use another day of rinse and soak
a panoply of vegetable accompany the fish entree
expect an appropriate variety from a seasonal stock that in early september include cauliflower broccoli carrot string bean tomato and not least onion and sweet green and red pepper
a dish of rice and black bean be also serve
in the wake of such hearty food dessert be hard to contemplate
yet when a dessert tray of almost a dozen selection be present we relent
most of the cake and tart be unremarkable but we enjoy mini custard tart pasteis de nata a huge baked apple not too sweet eggy flan and especially a choice of seasonal fruit include ripe fig and that sweet honeydew from the appetizer list

vinalhaven maine visit robert indiana 's remote maine mansion arch beautiful and borderline bizarre and you will find a man and an artist surround and haunt by love.
the word that be image of mr._indiana 's 1966 signature work love its four letter color and cubed hang on his wall sit on his shelf and peek through his window
it_' emblazon on poster depict in painting hew in marble and sew in sequin
it_' in english and in spanish and hebrew and chinese
and it be cast on coffee mug splash across magazine cover and on the side of a pair of high top converses
have you see one of my contribution to american culture mr._indiana say
so that all of our athlete can be properly shoe if_you detect a touch of ambivalence antipathy even toward the word from the man_who create it you be not mistaken
indeed while love make mr._indiana famous around the world success come at a steep price some say namely a lack of critical reckoning give many of his pop art peer like warhol oldenburg and lichtenstein
he be in some way both neglect and overexpose
i be a father to a bad child mr._indiana say
it bite me
in particular mr._indiana say because love with its tilt o be not properly copyright it spread to all sort_of place and product he do_not want
and that break his heart
rip offs have do a great harm to my_own reputation he say
but this_week restore that critical appreciation will be the goal of a new exhibition at the whitney museum of american art bill as the first major american museum retrospective of mr._indiana 's work
it_' long overdue the artist say during a recent visit to his home on an island in penobscot bay a pollock like splatter of land about 15 mile off rockland
i be famous in the 60
i be have this retrospective in 2013
well that ' take quite a while
it_' a show that its curator barbara haskell name robert indiana beyond love both to credit mr._indiana as the creator of one of pop art 's best_know piece and to move him past it
for his career it_' really be problematic because of the sheer ubiquity of it she_say
and i_think it_' blind people to the depth of his work
ms. haskell say she hop to show that while his work have this dazzling bold hard edge surface the subtext be all conceptually very complicated
john wilmerding an emeritus professor of american art at princeton say that mr._indiana like other pop artist draw from contemporary consumer culture as_well as printing and advertising
but he_add mr._indiana be more of an outlier mark by his fondness for literary touch and abstraction
many historian would argue he ' on the margin on pop he say
and i would place him there too
ms. haskell have include less know work many of which include the symbol common to mr._indiana 's prodigious and more famous output
there be numeral and circle star and herm the narrow sculpture affix with wheel which resemble roman mile marker
and of course there be word short simple message like eat and die more on this later man and sex.
for better or bad though no single word have mean more to mr._indiana 's career than love which begin as an image on a christmas card and end_up as a series of large sculpture see everywhere from taipei to wichita
i_'m sure all the people_who have be bear 20_year ago do_not know anything about me at all except love,'â say mr._indiana add with a mischievous glint
and that ' a nasty word
get old can make people blunt and mr._indiana 85 and in falter health be blunt
ask about pop art for_instance and he say he be a reluctant member of the movement
i do_not like be identify in that way he say
the very name be a trifle
how can you take something like p o p seriously he ask
similarly inquire about the current state of american art and you get this too_many artist too_many gallery and too_many people interested_in art
and those too_many people be not very interesting he_add 1_2 next_page

mr._wilcox be equally enamored of both
his new work make you realize anew that the metropolis and the move image be make for each_other
this piece center on an in the round bird's eye view of lower_manhattan that be shoot from the artist 's studio the 18th floor penthouse of a building on union square and compress the passing of one day into 30_minute
like the old style panorama it appear on a circular screen one that be about 7 foot high and 35 foot in diameter
hang about four and a half foot above the floor it_' like a giant lampshade
in the air be something of a departure for mr._wilcox 47 who have always come across as a kind_of romantic miniaturist
he be best_know for film only a few_minute long and often loop that be piece together from all kind_of existing footage
sometimes he would reshoot the find film several_time to achieve grainy fog of memory texture still image and brief tabletop sequence that he shoot himself be other staple
these work be intimate handmade reverie cryptic yet resonant with outsize theme history death love fame
mix fact and fiction they conjure historic figure like marlene dietrich or alexander the great but could also be autobiographical
while mr._wilcox 's early effort be most memorable when project small with in the air he go big and it work
he seem to have do this almost reflexively spur by the astounding 360-degree view from his studio to which he move from a low floor in the same building two_year ago
paralysis be his first response to this spectacular sight
he have say more_than once that he initially spend so_much time look_at the view that he think he may stop make art altogether
but in the end he use the beautiful implacable city as the setting and also the motivate force for a half_dozen miniaturist narrative expand his collage aesthetic without sacrifice its intimacy
after considerable trial and error and some uncooperative weather mr._wilcox be finally able in_july to shoot about 15 hour worth of one day in the life of new_york city
it take several week for condition to align
consistent_with his preference for low tech gear he downgrade his equipment from five complicated camera to the same number of relatively_small rugged inexpensive gopros
he also switch from filming to shooting still which improve resolution
and he pray for sun attend by sky that be not completely cloudless and boring
he end_up with 60,000 still shoot at a rate of one per second
these be individually process and then animate and speed_up use a computer program that seamlessly stitch the view together eliminate distortion and even light level
the majesty and clarity of this wraparound vista be stunning
the city look old almost timeless without the detail of street traffic and storefront
the sight include the con edison clock tower zeckendorf towers freedom tower and the west_side with glimpse of the hudson and new_jersey
the sun appear and set cloud of many different shade and shape push their shadow across the mass of architecture airplane arrive and depart the light of the city come on and then dim as the sun return
this flat footed documentary approach evoke andy warhol 's deadpan all but motionless 1964 classic empire that eight hour stationary shot of the empire_state building but mr._wilcox be too_much of a storyteller to leave it at this
superimpose on the panorama be six short cameo film in a way detail that pull us from one place or era one event or personality to another across vary film method between color and black and white

see the video in radical presence black performance in contemporary_art an entertaining and philosophically stimulating exhibition at new_york university 's grey art_gallery viewer may also read it as an allegory about be black in today 's america
too_often our still white dominate mass entertainment medium portray black man as belong_to one of two group a large one of bum defectives and criminal and a tiny one of magically gifted athlete musician and comedian leave a broad sector of more or less ordinary black citizen underrepresented
a remarkable thing about the exhibition be that much of it be in a comical vein like mr. mckenzie 's work
the show be organize by valerie cassel oliver senior curator at the contemporary arts museum houston where it open last november
one of the earliest piece be david hammons 's bliz aard ball sale document here in a slide show
for that 1983 work mr. hammons stand outdoors on a new_york sidewalk selling snowball neatly array on a blanket at his foot

in one he ' with a group of white haired tourist
a handwritten note recall they enjoy the lightness of negerhosen/2000 and marvel_at the gravity of its implication
more_than two dozen artist be represent in this show and not all of their work take a humorous approach
for_example in pretending to be rock 1993 sherman fleming stay on hand and knee under drip candle until he could no_longer bear the wax accumulate on his naked back
but since a strain of purposeful absurdity as oppose to say didactic righteousness can be find in almost_every piece in the show mr. desert 's observation could apply to the exhibition as a whole
that ' not just incidental
comedy often turn on contradiction between appearance and reality
mistaken identity abound in shakespeare 's comedy and in modern movie like trade place in which eddie murphy be transform from a street level con man into a wealthy investor whose polished demeanor fool the financial elite
many of the exhibition 's work involve deceptive appearance
in 1973 adrian piper do a series of outdoor guerrilla performance as the mythic being a menacing man with a mustache and an afro wig
in the early 80 lorraine o'grady go to new_york art opening as mlle bourgeoise noire wear a tiara and a floor length gown make of stitch together white glove

l who bill himself as the friendly black artist in america appear as a combination madman and shaman
wear only a jockstrap and boot he sit on a toilet at the top of a 10-foot high tower and consume the journal in strip with the help of ketchup and milk
among the reason for this penchant for role playing in black performance you may cite w. e. b. du bois 's notion of double consciousness the experience of see yourself through the eye of others rather_than as you_know yourself to be
to exaggerate the disparity between outer and inner comically or otherwise can be a way to unsettle prejudicial idea about identity
but there_' more to it than that
between appearance and reality imaginative field may open for the emergence of new reality and other way of be not only black or white but human
if the sci fi psychedelic digitally animate video by the young artist and dancer jacolby satterwhite bear 1986 presage the future of black performance it_' one that ' pregnant with mind stretch possibility
for immediate purpose there_' another half of the exhibition still to come

under the patronage of ottonian emperor who rule from a.d. 919 to 1014 it be a city of church the outstanding one be its grand cathedral pack with art advertising the glory of god and king

and the met show be pure cream skim off the top
that the art in it have survive at all be some kind_of miracle
many of these object be make as much for active use as for contemplation
large_scale sculpture be on constant public display in church be touch and kiss
small one travel the street in procession
gospel book be thumb through during service liturgical vessel be move about carry clean drop repair
and of course history keep happen
power change hand and with it control over church and treasure
in the 16th_century the protestant reformation put roman_catholic art under threat
enforce secularization in the 19th_century also take a toll
toward the end of world_war ii old hildesheim be level by bomb
a renovation of the rebuild cathedral have supply the pretext for send its art to the met
although almost none of the work can be attribute to individual artist the name of one man hover in the air that of bernward bishop of hildesheim from a.d. 993 to 1022
of noble saxon lineage he be more_than a high_rank cleric
he be a cosmopolitan traveler a court fixture a cultural impresario a serial self promoter and eventually a canonize saint
he be also one of the great shape art patron of his day and possibly an artist himself
his major architectural project in hildesheim be the benedictine church of st. michael for which he famously commission a set of immense bronze door each cover with narrative relief
the door do_not make it to new_york but at_least two sculpture monumental in feeling and historically associate_with bernward 's name do
one be the so_call golden madonna a statue of the virgin and child carve from linden wood overlay with sheet of hammer gold
although both its figure be headless now with their light glance surface stud with gemstone they be magnetically opulent and must once have be even more so
church record report that in the 15th century the sculpture be half bury in pile of brooch ring and necklace leave as offering
more be more be the modus operandi of medieval aesthetic and the show have textbook example begin with a gospel own by bernward
the book be already nearly a century old when he acquire it but he freshen it up and make it his_own by add a new cover with a byzantine ivory plaque affix to the front and his_own initial splash across the back
after his_death and maybe to celebrate his election to sainthood the cover be further adorn with robin' egg size crystal and miniature painting
material richness aside the golden madonna be significant for be one of the earliest fully three dimensional sculpture know from medieval europe
another be a five foot_tall figure of the crucify jesus believe to have be commission by bernward for the convent of ringelheim where his sister be abbess

washington house_republicans narrowly push through a bill on_thursday that slash billion of dollar from the food_stamp program over the objection of democrats and a veto threat from president_obama
the vote set_up what promise to be a major clash with the senate and dash hope for passage this_year of a new five_year farm_bill
the vote be 217 to 210 largely along party line
republican_leader under pressure from tea_party back conservative say the bill be need because the food_stamp program which cost nearly $_80 billion a year have grow out of control
they say the program have expand even as jobless rate have decline with the ease recession
this bill eliminate loophole ensure work requirement and put us on a fiscally responsible path say representative marlin stutzman republican of indiana who lead effort to split the food_stamp program from the overall farm_bill
in the real world we measure success by result
it_' time for washington to measure success by how_many family be lift out of poverty and help back on their foot not by how_much washington bureaucrat spend year after year
but even with the cut the food_stamp program would cost more_than $ 700 billion over the next 10_year
republicans invoke former_president bill_clinton in their defense of the bill say that the change be in the spirit of those that he sign into law in 1996 that set work requirement for those_who receive welfare
but democrats many of whom hold up picture of people they say would lose their benefit call the cut draconian and say they would plunge million into poverty
it_' a sad day in the people 's house when the leadership bring to the floor one of the most heartless bill i have ever see say representative james mcgovern democrat of massachusetts
it_' terrible policy trap in a terrible process
the measure have little chance of advance in the senate and senator debbie stabenow democrat of michigan and the chairwoman of the senate agriculture committee call it a monumental waste of time
the bill write under the direction of the house majority_leader eric_cantor republican of virginia would cut $_40 billion from the food_stamp program over the next 10_year
it would also require adult between 18 and 50 without minor child to find a job or to enroll in a work training program in order to receive benefit
it would also limit the time those recipient could get benefit to three_month
currently state can extend food_stamp benefit past three_month for able bodied people_who be work or prepare_for work as part_of a job training program
this bill make get americans back to work a priority again for our nation_'s welfare program house_speaker john_a. boehner say
the bill would also restrict people enrol in other social welfare program from automatically become eligible_for food_stamp
in_addition the legislation would allow state to require food_stamp recipient to be test for drug and to stop lottery winner from get benefit
the senate farm_bill also contain a restriction on lottery winner
critic of the measure say the cut would fall disproportionately on child
yes the federal_government have budget problem but child do_not cause them and cut anti hunger investment be the wrong way to solve them say bruce lesley president of first focus campaign for children a child advocacy_group
accord_to the congressional budget_office nearly four_million people would be remove from the food_stamp program under the house bill start next_year
the budget_office say after that about three million a year would be cut_off from the program
the budget_office say that leave unchanged the number of food_stamp recipient would decline by about 14 million_people or 30_percent over the next 10_year as the economy improve
a census_bureau report release on_tuesday find that the program have keep about four_million people above the poverty level and have prevent million more from sink further into poverty
the census_data also show nearly 47 million_people live in poverty close to the high_level in two_decade
historically the food_stamp program have be part_of the farm_bill a huge piece of legislation that have routinely be pass every five_year authorize financing for the nation_'s farm and nutrition program
but in_july house leader split the bill 's farm and nutrition section into separate measure pass the farm legislation over democrat objection
the move come after the house reject a propose farm_bill that would have cut $_20 billion from the food_stamp program
conservative lawmaker help kill the bill say the program need deep cut

if i have anything harsh to say about mcgoldrick 's thread i probably would not say it
this charming musical feature a troupe of talented teenage and preteenage dancer want nothing more_than to show you a nice time and it do
anyone criticize it sharply should be brand a sourpuss
the production part_of the 1st irish festival employ a cast of 17 to tell the story of a family live in the bronx in 1995

throughout their problem the family_member sing about their past in ireland their household tradition and their everyday worry
step dance routine be intersperse throughout prompt whoop and cheer from the audience
much of the loud appreciative applause at a recent performance be no_doubt from the parent of the young dancer though some of it come from at_least one critic
ah why not
as the shy magee casey murray 15 have an appealing stage presence
her singing voice be gentle and pleasing her dancing control but energetic
garrett coleman portray eddie her potential beau
he ' a fierce dancer with a carefree smile
jason oremus as a crusty teacher also own a fast set of foot
paul nugent conor mcintyre and john charles mclaughlin as magee 's brother have splendid comic timing while elizabeth west and peter cormican as her parent exude warmth
that warmth be important here
the script by marianne driscoll often veer toward cliche this irish family have a penchant for alcohol and spin tall tale
but the character radiate enough genuine affection to make such moment forgivable
the mod song with lyric by ms. driscoll and eliot riskin and music by ronnie d'addario patrick mangan be credit with the dance_music also aim for easy emotional target that they usually hit
mcgoldrick 's thread direct_by kira simring at theater 80 end just where you would expect and right where it should finish with a final bit of footwork from the young cast member

direct_by david m. rosenthal and write by matthew f. jones from his 1996 novel a single shot have many of the fixing of a classic noir include bad woman bad man and an existential loner with no obvious exit
as with some noir hero moon do_not just back into trouble he throw himself right into its pitiless embrace partly by make all the wrong move
for starter he hide the corpse and take the cash
then he start eyeball a tough look local jason isaacs one of those charmer in black leather with an iron cross tattoo on his neck
fatalism can be a beautiful thing in film noir a character 's apparent stupidity on the other_hand grow old very quickly
build my gallows high baby robert mitchum tell jane greer in the indelible classic
out of the past surrender to the glorious creature who ' the beautiful instrument of his destruction
but pessimism be not moon 's problem nor be desire or destiny or overwhelming terminal despair or well anything other than underdeveloped narrative and character
mr. rosenthal put the story 's part into play well enough but once everyone and everything be in position that ' more or less where they stay as this slow story downshift to a crawl
moon remain in his trailer even when it_' clear that he should leave as everything_else around him flail about
character make big entrance and exit yell and threaten in a hash of movie make southern accent
william h. macy as a two bit lawyer show up wear a lavishly bad toupee while jeffrey wright stumble and mumble with a mouth full of marble drop by moon 's trailer with party girl

on_wednesday however the fed say it would maintain_its $_85 billion monthly purchase of treasury and mortgage_back security
over all_these report point to a sustain pickup in economic_growth momentum say millan mulraine an_economist at td securities
the manufacturing sector also be show sign of brisk growth
factory activity in the mid atlantic region increase by the most in more_than two_year in september and firm optimism about the future hit a 10-year high accord_to a survey conduct_by the philadelphia federal_reserve bank
the philadelphia fed_'s business activity index jump to 22.3 in september easily beat economist expectation for a reading of 10.0
any reading above zero indicate expansion in the region 's manufacturing
in yet_another indication the economy be shrug off higher borrowing cost an index of lead indicator advance by a great than expect 0.7 percent in_august compare_with a 0.5 percent rise in_july accord_to the conference board
the economy be grind its way higher say mark l. lehmann president of jmp securities

after tiller a new documentary by martha shane and lana wilson be a partisan document in the culture war
it could hardly be otherwise since the film 's subject abortion be one where common ground be elusive if not philosophically untenable
the four doctor interview and observe on screen who the film say be the only one in the united_states openly perform third trimester abortion be heroic figure in the filmmaker eye but be condemn as murderer by those on the other side
it would be nice to believe_that a movie like this could provoke civil and respectful dialogue about an intensely polarizing issue but let_'s not kid ourselves
the four doctor two in new mexico one in colorado and one in nebraska honor the memory of their colleague george tiller who be assassinate in_2009 in wichita kan. where his clinic have be the scene of protest threat and attack
since that killing and especially since the 2010 election a number of state have pass more restrictive abortion law nebraska be one of them
this force dr. leroy carhart to find a new place to practice and his attempt_to do so inflame anti abortion activist in iowa and in maryland where he finally open a clinic
while the other doctor warren hern in boulder and susan robinson and shelley sella who share an office in albuquerque do_not face that kind_of disruption they contend with continuous picketing and with the hovering invisible threat of violence
but ms. shane and ms. wilson be less interested_in recapitulate political debate than in understand how the doctor approach work that would be emotionally difficult and ethically challenging even without the incessant controversy
some of the patient who come to them be in the late stage of plan pregnancy and have recently learn of catastrophic fetal anomaly
others be teenager who have through fear denial or ignorance allow their pregnancy to continue past the stage when simple more readily available abortion would be possible
in each case the physician and the counselor who work with them have to figure_out an appropriate course of action
at one point dr. robinson and a colleague disagree about_whether to help a young_woman end her pregnancy even_though she identify herself as pro life and their exchange be one of the most illuminating discussion i have see about the complicated reality of abortion
documentary can rarely be judge as work of dispassionate neutral reporting since few of them aspire to uphold those journalistic criterion
rather a documentary should be assess as a representation of the world as it be from a perspective that be itself part_of that world
after tiller be impressive because it honestly present the view of supporter of legal abortion and be thus a valuable contribution to a public argument that be unlikely to end anytime soon

a new plan may sweep away the cobweb
the new_york naval shipyard begin build ship in 1806 as the early republic begin to build up its navy
in 1838 one of the large structure open the 200-foot long hospital on a rise overlook the yard but now screen by tree
the architect martin e. thompson design a spare c shape building of near white marble as severe and straight as a nun 's ruler in parochial school
although two story in height the doric styling and extreme length of the front evoke the taut modernism of the international style like mies van der rohe 's flat front school of social service administration at the university of chicago
before steamship by the time sailor and marines injure in place like the halls of montezuma get back to the united_states any dramatic wound would have stabilize or prove fatal so the navy probably deal_with invalid rather_than the freshly injure
that the hospital have a rural character be suggest by an 1851 ad in the brooklyn daily eagle for a lost red cow with a white face for which a $_5 reward be offer for her delivery at the hospital
in 1871 the eagle report that 32 patient be in house and that although such a quiet and comfortable location may attract malingerer the sham be so easily detect that it be rare
in 1878 the eagle note an outbreak of yellow fever although at_least one of the case be a false alarm cause_by what the newspaper describe as an overdose of very questionable whisky and an inordinate feed of cucumber
in the spanish american war of 1898 the hospital ship solace deliver to the hospital 43 marine and sailor from the cuban campaign most suffering with disease like dysentery
one of the actual injure a rough rider name mason mitchell could hardly be accuse of malingering despite a shrapnel wound in the back he hop a ride with some reporter on their tug and go ashore in manhattan
on the other_hand another trip by the solace to the hospital carry
man whose face and head be bandage others whose face be pale and sunken from long suffering man_who shuffle about the deck with crutch

after the navy decommission the yard in the 1960 it hold_onto the hospital for administrative headquarters
when it do leave in 1989 the navy do a conscientious seal up job and careful monitoring by the brooklyn navy_yard development corporation have prevent the usual devastation
in most case an_empty building in such an isolated position would be a near ruin but the plywood that cover most the window be intact the gutter and roof appear to be in good shape and there be no graffiti even the remain glaze window in the entry loggia be unbroken
it be a preservation miracle
photographer have occasionally make trip inside like richard nickel jr. who post his picture at his blog kingstonlounge
they show the entire interior completely coat with a thin coat of whitewash it look_like a burial shroud
the room be empty except for some fallen plaster and peel paint like something from a stephen_king novel half dream half nightmare
it be not a ruin so_much as something you may run across in a haunt lose and find an architectural orphan
now the brooklyn navy_yard hospital look as if it may be find
steiner studios a film and television studio be a major presence in the navy_yard and plan to spend $ 400 million to take_over and restore the hospital construct additional space for medium and tech purpose
douglas c. steiner the chairman say in an_e mail that he first saw the hospital in 1999 and it scream movie studio to me
you_can not just stroll into the navy_yard except for the visitor 's center building 92 on flushing avenue which have an intriguing exhibition on its long history
that ' where two hour shuttle bus tour of the yard operate by turnstile tours leave from on saturdays and sundays
the hospital be the last stop and visitor can walk_around outside but not inside
a quiet peace will wash over you as you circle the building through the overgrown grass
it_' rare in the city and unique in the navy_yard otherwise a combination of hipster silicon valley high_tech and ragged industrial archaeology

to laura with love at the metropolitan room on_wednesday evening i have many you be there moment picture nyro who die at 49 in 1997 as a colorfully attire hippie street princess dance down broadway in a trance
nyro 's fusion of folk r&b jazz and show tune be kaleidoscopic blast of feeling that ignore the rule of conventional songwriting to go wherever their turbulent emotion carry them
ms. cosgrove who be accompany_by piano bass guitar and two backup singer do_not have nyro 's vocal clout
the one singer to come close to capture that sound have be rickie lee jones
but ms. cosgrove project a deep understanding_of nyro 's song lyric most of which be the expression of a brilliant rebellious teenager break free of all constraint to assert herself whatever the cost
the material be divide into section
wild euphoria stoned soul picnic sweet blindness give way to the agonize response of a vulnerable romantic
it end with reflection on death
the strong section during which ms. cosgrove steadily gain in confidence be a sequence of song excoriate male fecklessness
the crown number eli 's comin'â be an alarmed warning to every woman in sight that a heartbreaker have be spot in the vicinity and must be avoid at all cost the fox be about to enter the henhouse
of all the female singer_songwriter who come of age in the late 1960 nyro be the most overtly feminist
woman and child occupy one side of the playing field and man the other and coexistence however tempting be perilous

four dancer dress in white strike angular pose at the rear
they be like art object but also like a police lineup array for the audience 's inspection
gradually they advance eventually draw close enough to be touch though no_one touch them
look_at their viewer or at one another their eye appear to welcome contact at one moment and to shy from it the next
move independently they become distinct as individual

anna adams stark be unruly awkward defensive with an uplift chin
donna cicchesi be a seductress in body language but beneath her bang her eye keep retreat to the side
she tend_to stay out of everyone_else 's way
much of the time each performer do his or her_own thing all at once but the interaction among_them take on drama
the work be highly episodic a structure emphasize by joe levasseur 's lighting subtly cool and warm and by jason sebastian 's sound design shift among buzz guitar figure and sometimes a beat
though all four dancer occasionally come together in stillness or in burst of motion the most intense encounter occur in pair
two people build some pattern in common until one of them break off
two people almost touch but keep a tiny distance or they do touch and the touch turn violent
someone come away smug someone come away hurt
play against more abstract element the interpersonal drama intrigue
the work be skillfully shape and pace
yet despite its compositional sophistication there_' something adolescent about it all something high_school like a white on white abstraction of the breakfast club
the identify mannerism like ms. cicchesi 's tentative raising of her hand as in class grow irritating with repetition
what at first seem to reveal character eventually become a wall
that happen in life too but as art i find it dispiriting
the dancer leave the space one by one alone

candace pert a neuroscientist who help discover a fundamental element of brain chemistry as a graduate_student and go on to become a major proponent of alternative medicine die on_sept. 12 at her home in potomac md.
she be 67
the cause be cardiac arrest say her_sister deane beebe
dr._pert be work at the johns_hopkins university school of medicine in the 1970 when a team she be on find one of the most seek after object in brain research the receptor in the brain that opiate like morphine fit into like a key in a lock allow the drug 's effect to work
the discovery of the opioid receptor would in 1978 earn the covet albert lasker award often a precursor to the nobel prize
the award go to solomon h. snyder who head the lab
neither dr._pert nor any of the other lab assistant be cite
such omission be common in the world of science the graduate_student in the lab rarely get credit beyond be the first name on the paper describe the research
but dr._pert do something unusual she protest send a letter to the head of the foundation that award the prize say she have play a key role in initiate the research and follow it up and be angry and upset to be exclude
her letter cause a sensation in the field
some saw her exclusion as an example of the burden and barrier woman face in science career
in a 1979 article about dr._pert in the the washington post dr. snyder who have laud dr._pert 's contribution in his lasker acceptance speech argue_that that ' the way the game be play add that today 's graduate_student will be tomorrow 's lab chief and that when they have student it will be the same
the two later reconcile
in an_e mail interview on_wednesday dr. snyder now a professor in the solomon h. snyder department of neuroscience at johns_hopkins call dr._pert one of the most creative innovative graduate_student i have ever mentor
dr._pert continue her career at the national_institute of mental_health where she continue to do pioneering work on receptor and the peptide that correspond to them come to conclusion that steer her toward alternative medicine
she become a lead proponent of the unity of mind and body and the ability of emotion to affect health
when bill moyers in a 1993 pbs special healing and the mind ask her be you say that the mind talk to the body so to speak through these neuropeptides
she answer why be you make the mind outside of the body
she be also feature prominently in the 2004 film what the $
do we know which attempt_to bridge science and spirituality
in her best_know book molecules of emotion the science behind mind body medicine publish in 1997 dr._pert advocate a more holistic approach to understand health
i_'ve come to believe_that virtually all illness if not psychosomatic in foundation have a definite psychosomatic component she write
the molecule of emotion she argue run every system in our body create a bodymind 's intelligence that be wise enough to seek wellness without a great deal of high_tech medical intervention
the author deepak chopra who write the foreword to molecules of emotion call the book a landmark in our understanding_of the mind body connection
dr. miles herkenham a former colleague at the national_institute of mental_health say that it may_seem odd to an outside observer that a scientist of dr._pert 's training would go into what he call the squishy world of alternative medicine
but the common theme that underlie all of her work be her knowledge as a pharmacologist of ligand peptide and how they work through receptor he say add she follow her_own passion
her work lead dr._pert to team up with her_husband dr. michael ruff an immunologist to investigate another protein peptide t. they hop that it would be effective in fight h.i.v. by block the entry of the virus into cell
while the drug show promise it have not lead to a successful treatment
dr._pert publish more_than 250 scientific paper on peptide
in more recent_year she and dr. ruff found a company rapid pharmaceuticals that be develop peptide base drug to treat alzheimer_'s cardiovascular disease and other disease by fight the inflammation that underlie many chronic medical condition

i_want there to be a field that look for the biochemical substrate of psychology she_say
that field do_not really exist at the time
but i begin to search_for it and it begin to exist

a couple of decade_ago chinese restaurant be as ubiquitous as italian one
nearly every town on long_island have at_least one
today japanese fusion and pan asian spot have take their place
maru asian cuisine in st. james be a recent example of the trend in name at_least
the restaurant open in march in the space formerly occupy by lotus east one of the island 's top chinese restaurant for 25_year
jia liu a first_time restaurateur buy it from its original owner last fall and begin to offer teriyaki pad thai and shrimp bali style as special
in may he create a new menu incorporate these and other pan asian offering though a majority of the dish be still chinese
maru look much like the old lotus east
the spacious dining_room feature chinese statue and painting and a ceiling hang with red chinese lantern
floor be carpet the chair cushion be red and gold silk and the tablecloth and napkin be pale pink
as in old school chinese restaurant crispy noodle arrive_at the table accompany_by hot mustard and duck sauce
maru also send out a complimentary salad of mixed green cucumber tomato and carrot in a ginger dress a nice touch
unfortunately maru do_not live up to lotus east when it come to the food
our meal have ups and down with almost equal number of success and failure
service be pleasant but sometimes confused a language barrier may have be an issue in some case
for a splendid start to a meal order shrimp toast four triangle of crispy goodness
run a close second be the crunchy vietnamese spring roll slim cylinder fill_with shred vegetable
edamame liberally sprinkle with salt be another plus
but avoid the gyoza
they contain shrimp not the usual pork and the filling be mushy with a strong fishy taste
barbecue rib be flavorful but tough
chicken lettuce wrap be tasty but be miss the crunch of water chestnut they also lack the usual accompaniment of hoisin sauce which may have spark their flavor
the best entree we sample be shrimp bali style a stir fry of seafood and vegetable baby corn pepper peapods and mushroom in a flavor pack brown sauce with thai seasoning
pad thai moist and not overly sweet be also above average
a surprise hit be flaky and moist steamed salmon with an assertive scallion and ginger sauce
however singapore chow mei fun a favorite that i have taste in every chinese restaurant that have offer it be a dud
the angel hair pasta have none of the characteristic curry flavor
in fact it have no flavor at all only heat from red pepper
speak of heat shred pork in garlic sauce request mild be the spicy version i have ever taste
slice beef with scallion be tender and tasty but mango chicken be overly sweet
dessert be even more limited here than it be at many asian restaurant
the menu list fry banana fried ice_cream fried cheesecake and litchi but none be available on our visit the only choice be ice_cream or pineapple chunk
the ice_cream be ordinary we pass on the pineapple
driver on north country road will see the big new sign for maru asian cuisine but they will also see sign on the outside wall and on the awning that say lotus east
people answer the phone recently still say lotus east but do_not be fool while maru have some good dish it be not in the same league as its predecessor

i be super fortunate to get to see both

florham park n.j. when rex ryan be hire to coach the jets in_2009 he insist on run effectively a philosophy that he capture in the catchphrase ground and pound
even as the jets develop geno smith a rookie quarterback who understandably lack polish that be no_longer ryan 's mantra do i expect us to run more_than pass
not really ryan say after thursday 's practice
i_'d like to be close to balance
i_think that ' where we have be the first couple of game
so i_think that '_pretty good
the jets who will host the buffalo bills on_sunday in a meeting of a.f.c. east team with 1_1 record have attempt 74 pass and 61 rush
smith drop back 42 time in a 13 10 loss at the new_england patriots on_sept. 12 in a game that raise_question about how committed marty mornhinweg the new offensive coordinator would be to the run
the jets back off the ground game despite rush 32 time for 129 yard smith throw three interception in the fourth_quarter
mornhinweg be well_know for his pas first approach
this be the most i have ever run he say and ryan appear to welcome that
the old football mentality about would i prefer to run the ball than throw it
yeah of course ryan say
but that being say the way the game be play now i also like to attack down the field
smith 's statistical line at new_england and his forgettable fourth_quarter raise_question about his ability_to lead that kind_of offense so soon
he complete only 15 of 35 pass for 214 yard
the jets score their lone touchdown on bilal powell 's 3-yard run with five_minute leave in the third_quarter
powell carry 13 time for 48 yard
chris ivory who be expect to play a major_role after he be acquire from the new_orleans saint during the off_season have 12 carry for 52 yard
but ivory carry only once after powell 's score
mornhinweg sound as though he be willing_to stay the course
he be learn on the job just a little_bit he say of smith and that ' o.k. mornhinweg the third offensive coordinator under ryan have far_more experience than his_predecessor brian schottenheimer and tony sparano
sparano have never hold the position before and last only one season before he be dismiss and mornhinweg be hire
mornhinweg who learn the west_coast offense under bill walsh the former 49er coach build a strong resume with san_francisco and then for the last 10_year with the philadelphia eagles
during mornhinweg 's time with philadelphia the eagles set single season franchise record for completion 367 in 2012 total net yard 6,386 in_2011 completion percentage 62 in_2010 point 439 in_2010 average yard_per rush 5.4 in_2010 third down percentage 42.4 in 2007 and net passing yard 4,119 in_2006 among_others
with that background member of the jets readily accept whatever he present them
i_'ve always be a fan of run the ball early so you get into a rhythm right guard willie colon say
but that ' not the way we_'re build right_now
we_'re build to have geno get the ball in the air
ryan believe_that the great issue for the jet involve execution not approach
they have a number of drop pass against the patriots
you_'re leave a_lot of play out there he say
if we could have catch half of those ball we drop the outcome may have be a_lot different
clearly you_'re an n.f.l. receiver you_'re pay to catch the football and we certainly need to do it
extra points coach rex ryan open his news_conference by offer condolence to tom coughlin his giants counterpart

willie colon decline to say how_much the n.f.l. fin him for his role in a fracas with the patriots in the final minute on_sept. 12 but he say he be appeal
it be totally too_much say colon who make contact with an official who be attempt_to restore order
woodville ala. there be at_least two type_of alabamian you do_not want_to anger
one be a wild raccoon
the other be a person_who rehabilitate wild raccoon
the state conservation agency that give permit to volunteer who help injure and orphaned wildlife send out a letter this_month tell 72 group and individual to stop rehabilitate certain animal
instead the animal should be leave to their fate or euthanized either with a bullet or at the hand of a veterinarian
from the state 's perspective the move would help prevent rabies and keep the food chain in balance
there be no biological reason to rehabilitate these animal say ray metzler assistant chief of wildlife for the alabama department of conservation and natural resources
people need to learn to let nature take its course
on the list be feral pig coyote bat and fox animal that do_not often end_up in the care of the volunteer
but at the top of the list be raccoon
raccoon have never have it easy in alabama where a hunting license and a good coon dog be cultural currency in some part_of the state
hunting association here can legally keep up to 10 raccoon in a cage to train coon hound
and since the 1950 the state have offer permit for an event call coon on the log
the contest which be rare these_day be design to test a coon hound 's mettle
a raccoon be tie to a log and float into a lake
owner then release their dog and see which one have the fortitude to knock the raccoon into the water
but rehabbers as the people devote to help injure wildlife call themselves love raccoon
they be as cuddly as puppy and easy to train when they be young but extraordinarily ornery once they hit adolescence which be when rehabbers generally release them back into the wild
john russ a 65-year old former marine just last_week release two raccoon on his 144-acre sanctuary here
he and other rehabbers say the new restriction stem_from a conflict between member of one rehabilitation group and local wildlife official
but they also believe an inherent anti raccoon bias be at play
these_guy they have some issue with raccoon mr. russ say
they always have
a hunter first mentality the rehabbers say lead to the state 's suggestion that raccoon along_with possum and skunk which be also on the list be euthanized or just leave to fend for themselves
baby raccoon be often orphan because tree fell to clear land leave animal homeless or new ribbon of roadway bring more car which kill mother
a ford truck be not nature take its course say april russ mr. russ 's wife who be also a rehabber
the state 's rehabbers have vow to fight the ban even_if it bring trouble in a state where keep a wild animal without a permit be illegal
if somebody bring me a baby raccoon i be not go to turn it away mr. russ say
it_' a death sentence
pleas for support have be send to people for the ethical treatment of animals and to ellen degeneres and bob barker both animal right_activist
two petition with at_least 28,000 signature be be prepare_for gov. robert bentley
word be get out to more rehabbers a tight knit group that have work for decade to develop national guideline
they share best practice like what to fee a baby squirrel how large a raccoon nesting box should be or how to make_sure animal do_not get too accustomed to human while they be nurse back to health
the whole world be go to see this horrific thing happen in alabama say kim baker of coast and canyon wildlife rehabilitation in malibu calif.
mr. metzler insist there be nothing nefarious in the new policy which he say be develop not out of a dislike for rehabbers or raccoon but after a year of study and consultation with federal wildlife and rabies expert
he say the goal be to standardize policy that regulate both rehabbers and people_who get pay to remove nuisance wildlife like a snake in a garage or a raccoon in an attic
we be not try_to put them out of business by any mean mr. metzler say add that rehabbers can still save rabbit deer and squirrel
the point be we would like for people to leave wildlife alone he say
that raccoon that ' accustom to eat out of the dog bowl it_' not go to survive in the wild
on_sept. 20 1932 11 worker sit on a beam 69 floor above manhattan during the construction of rockefeller center
the photograph of this moment one of the most_famous image of new_york be call lunch atop a skyscraper even_though a cigarette and a liquor bottle in the hand of these workman be as noticeable as any sandwich
open 81 year to the day_after that photograph be take be man at lunch a documentary_about the picture 's resonance as a symbol of everymen and about the mystery of who those man really be
the film 's narration by the irish actress fionnula flanagan be lovely the detail reveal of the photograph be fascinating and the commentary by historian on how the photograph relate to life during the depression and to the immigrant experience be illuminating
yet the film feel meander
not only do it offer a jumble of idea that be not follow through but it_' also structure oddly
it culminate in the revelation that two of the worker in the picture be possibly from a small irish village which seem a detour from the american grandeur and casual bravery on which the film focus
that the director sean o cualain be irish and that the film be finance partly by the irish film board may explain this emphasis
but a montage of modern construction at the world_trade center site near the end seem even more off the mark and without thematic connection to what precede it
prime_minister shinzo abe on_thursday order the operator of japan 's crippled nuclear_power plant to scrap all six reactor at the site instead of just four schedule for decommissioning and to concentrate_on tackle press issue like leak of radioactive water
but mr. abe insist_that radioactive water have be contain at the fukushima daiichi plant and say that he would fend off rumor regard fukushima 's safety
he instruct the plant 's operator the tokyo electric_power company to decommission the no
5 and no 6 reactor which survive the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami that damage the four other reactor
mr. abe say he stand by the reassurance about tokyo 's safety that he give to the international olympic committee this_month before the city be award the right to host the 2020 summer olympic games
but many japanese believe_that he be gloss over problem at the plant
official have acknowledge_that radiation contaminate groundwater have be seep into the ocean since soon_after meltdown and explosion cripple the plant
moscow the russian government on_thursday approve across the board budget_cut over the next two_year in the clear sign yet that official do_not expect its economy the world 's eighth large to revive soon and that the kremlin be ready to try a new policy to spur growth
make the move more unusual the cut come midway_through a previously approve spending plan and they reflect a shift in strategy away_from reliance on consumer spending
in russia budget be approve for three_year in advance rather_than year by year
the finance ministry now project that revenue will be 3.5 percent low in 2014 and 7 percent low in 2015 than it predict a year_ago when the government of president_vladimir v._putin approve the three_year spending plan
under the revised budget military salary will be freeze next_year and the government will put less money into a pension fund for future retiree
it will use the money to meet current pension obligation instead
the budget turn_out really tough dmitri a. medvedev the prime_minister and a former_president say in comment carry by russian news_agency on_thursday when he present the new plan
we have to work off the real situation in the economy in our country and in the world
the problem for russia 's economy run deeper than its overwhelming dependence on oil and ga revenue which account for more_than half the federal budget
wage that for year rise fast than labor productivity under economic_policy that make mr._putin widely popular have now price russians out of the market for many good and service globally
russia 's economy be now grow more slowly than that of the united_states
in the second_quarter the gross_domestic product rise 1.2 percent in russia compare_with 2.5 percent in the united_states
official spend the summer debate how to reverse the slowing of economic_growth here
in a speech in_june mr._putin suggest the kremlin would try_to prime the economy with government spending by dip_into about_$ 171 billion in reserve in sovereign wealth fund to finance infrastructure project like modernize the trans siberian railway
those spending plan be never carry_out
since_then the economic_policy team have change direction economist say and the new approach become clear with the release of the plan for cut the three_year budget rather_than run high deficit
they want_to change the model of growth in russia 's economy away_from dependence on consumer spending vladimir i. tikhomirov chief_economist at the otkritie brokerage house say of the new policy
the government and central_bank have decide their top priority be to bring inflation down
this shift mr. tikhomirov say reflect a deep seat aversion by mr._putin to foreign borrowing of the type that make the soviet_union beholden to western bank in its late year
in light of the worsen slowdown here further stimulus would require foreign borrowing
it go against normal economic_policy to cut spending in the face of an economic slowdown mr. tikhomirov say
the new russian policy instead retrace a growth strategy follow successfully in the late 1990 by eastern european nation like poland which focus intensely on control inflation and borrowing cost for business
though this bring a temporary slowdown and even recession in some country business activity pick_up as rate come down
the russian government predict several year of slow growth of about 3_percent down from the 4.5 percent previously forecast
but inflation the bane of post soviet russia for many year be project to drop to 4.5 to 5.5 percent next_year and below 5_percent in subsequent year from around 6 percent this_year
without new growth produce_by low interest_rate in the late part_of this decade the government will struggle to meet demand for increase spending on pension for the country_'s age population
in the short_term as inflation be bring under control and before growth pick_up mr._putin could find his political support erode
mr. tikhomirov the otkritie economist say the policy should start show result in 2016 or so before mr._putin be up for re_election in 2018
the government must submit the plan to the parliament for approval by oct._1 though major change be unlikely
in the day_before aaron_alexis call the police in newport r.i. to complain that he be hear_voice send by a microwave machine employee at the residence inn in nearby middletown be struggle to cope with his behavior

the company do_not respond immediately to request for comment on_thursday
it be one of numerous occasion in the week just before the shooting on_monday when mr._alexis increasingly bizarre behavior be note by others include hotel employee guard at a virginia airport and the police in newport
yet no_one manage to head off the violence
much remain unknown about mr._alexis life and what drive his action gap that be likely_to remain at_least partly unfilled with his fatal shooting by police_officer at the navy_yard

and like other mass killer before him james e. holmes in colorado jared l. loughner in arizona seung hui cho in virginia he leave a trail of telltale sign that be minimize misinterpret or ignore
in many way mr._alexis 34 seem a jumble of contradiction
in fort_worth where he spend year in the navy reserve he be describe as friendly and sociable drink heineken at bar with co_worker and chat with customer at the thai restaurant happy bowl where he work for a time
but he also hold a piece of himself apart
he would kind_of close into himself say melinda downs who know him in fort_worth and serve_as a motherly figure in his life
he do_not let a whole bunch of people in because he would be hurt
he handle himself carefully
like others ms. downs recall mr._alexis as sweet and often playful
but he also have outburst of rage some extreme he tell the police inâ seattle in 2004 that he shoot out the tire of a construction worker 's car in an anger fuel blackout
and co_worker at the borough of manhattan community college in new_york describe him as a person_who hold on to grudge and do_not tolerate fool gladly
perhaps in an effort to keep his more violent emotion in check mr._alexis practice theravada buddhism meditate for hour on the thick rug of a temple in white_settlement the suburb west of fort_worth where he live on and off for three_year
he tell one man affiliate with the temple that he aspire to be a monk but he would stay up late at night play violent video_game in his room
mr._alexis a computer specialist who lead an itinerant life travel to naval installation around the country to service their system seem aware of his emotional problem tell friend he suffer from depression and post traumatic stress disorder

washington putting down a marker before his coming trip to the united_nations secretary of state_john kerry say thursday that it be essential for the united_nations security_council to pass a resolution next_week to eliminate syria_'s chemical_arsenal
now the test come mr._kerry say
the united_nations security_council must be prepare to act next_week
when the united_states and russia reach a framework_agreement on_saturday to remove or destroy syria_'s chemical_weapon mr._kerry emphasize that the next step be for the council to pass a bind resolution to enforce the accord
since_then however important difference_between russia and the united_states have emerge that call into question_whether the agreement will ever be carry_out
american french and british official have push for a strong security_council resolution which would provide a basis for impose punitive measure if president_bashar al_assad of syria fail to comply
the united_states and france have also say that the threat of force must be maintain to ensure_that mr._assad follow through
but sergey_v. lavrov the russian foreign_minister have continue to assert that there be no proof the assad_government carry_out a chemical attack near damascus on_aug. 21 suggest this_week that additional investigation be need before the council could take any firm action
russia have also reject the potential use of force
in the statement by mr._kerry on_thursday which he read at the state_department he insist_that the case against the assad_government be ironclad and have be buttress by the recent united_nations report on the attack
despite the effort of some to suggest otherwise thanks to this_week 's long await u.n. report the fact in syria only grow clear and the case only grow more compelling mr._kerry say
the secretary of state be schedule to go to new_york on_sunday for a week of meeting in conjunction with the convening of the united_nations general_assembly
we really do_not have time today to pretend that anyone can have their_own set of fact approach the issue of chemical_weapon in syria he say
earlier on_thursday mr._kerry meet with foreign_minister wang yi of china seek support for a firm resolution in the security_council
in public remark before a work lunch mr._kerry note_that the united_states and china have differ sharply over how strongly to respond to the chemical_weapon attack
but he appeal to china to play a positive constructive important role in the council 's deliberation
mr. wang say that china which hold a security_council veto support the framework_agreement and believe_that the united_nations should as_well
but he do_not provide any clue as to how firmly the resolution should be word
vice_president joseph r. biden jr. also meet with mr. wang
as the united_states and russia seek to influence the security_council resolution a senior member of the assad_government say that a cease fire should be impose if peace_talk be hold to end the conflict
neither the armed opposition nor the regime be capable of defeat the other side qadri jamil the syrian deputy prime_minister say in an_interview with the guardian
this zero balance of force will not change for a while
mr._kerry plan to meet next_week with mr._lavrov and lakhdar brahimi the united_nations envoy on the syria crisis to discuss planning for a possible peace conference
no date for a conference have be set and russia and the united_states be at odds over who should attend
russia for_example have insist_that iran should participate
the united_states have opposed include iran and say the london 11 a group of european and arab nation that support the syrian_opposition should attend
even as he call for a peace conference however mr. jamil object to proposal by the united_states and its allies as to how it should be organize
the united_states have insist_that a syrian_opposition coalition lead by ahmad al jarba play a major_role in negotiate a transfer of power to a transitional government from which mr._assad would be exclude
we_'re feed up with this monopolistic view mr. jamil say
berlin a few_week ago germany_'s leave lean social democratic_party throw a lavish campaign event for more_than 200,000 people next to the brandenburg gate in the middle of berlin
there be bratwurst balloon and song but the party never_quite take off
perhaps that ' because in this sunday 's national election the social democratic_party germany_'s old and proud be likely_to endure yet_another crushing defeat just as it do in_2009 when it be vote out of government with a meager 23 percent of the vote
when you ask lead member of the social_democrats to explain_why on_earth they be lose so_much ground at a time when global capitalism have be get such bad press they have an easy answer
it be chancellor_angela merkel_'s fault
the right of center chancellor they feel constantly outflank them on the left minimum_wage gender quota in the workplace same_sex marriage they name it she hasten to adopt it
she even order the shutdown of the country_'s nuclear_power plant a signature goal of the social_democrats ally the green party after the 2011 fukushima disaster in japan
but blame ms._merkel be too easy
there be a long story to tell
the social democratic_party which be celebrate its 150th birthday this_year be once the world 's large and most influential worker party the global standard bearer for the modern european welfare state
by the end of the 20th_century though it be often more about nostalgia for past accomplishment than the present and future of its constituent
but by the early part_of the last decade the social_democrats under the leadership of chancellor gerhard schrã¶der be once_again ahead of the game
the party saw itself as a force for modernization it romanticize the future not the past
the welfare state have to be adjust if it be to survive at all and have to fit an age country with more migrant fewer natural resource and few child
our current wirtschaftswunder or business miracle of economic success amid a europe wide recession be largely a result of painful labor reform put in place by mr. schrã¶der and the social_democrats begin in 2003
the reform pay off for the country as a whole but they be hard on the poor
union lambast mr. schrã¶der and thousand march in the street against_him
the reform cost his party a third of its member many of whom flee to a new party the left which draw much of its strength from those disappoint with post communist life in the former east germany
that membership exodus cost the social_democrats control of the government in 2005 after which they be force into a so_call grand_coalition with ms._merkel 's christian_democrats
in response the social_democrats distance themselves from mr. schrã¶der and his reform apologize profusely for their great achievement
so while ms._merkel may co opt some left wing issue as her_own on the big issue of all it be the social_democrats who have cede the political payoff of mr. schrã¶der 's reform low unemployment and a stable social_security system to the right
the christian_democrats would never dream of pick a fight with the union or face demonstrator in the street
ms._merkel recently admit as much we would not be where we be today without the courageous step take by my predecessor chancellor schrã¶der
all be not lose for the social_democrats however
for month peer_steinbrã¼ck the sharp tongued witty candidate of the party stumble from one gaffe to the next
he come across as arrogant technocratic and uncaring and as a centrist uncomfortable with take up the left 's banner
at the low point of his campaign he find_himself reduce to tear during a public appearance with his_wife after she express her support for him
but he have begin to turn thing around
in a recent tv debate mr._steinbrã¼ck manage to come across as decisive and politically brave by question ms._merkel 's one weakness her unwillingness to take a stand to run a political risk
suddenly mr._steinbrã¼ck 's technocratic arrogance look_like a strength
with election day approach social_democrats have long give_up on the idea of win outright
what they dread now be do just well enough to be force again into a coalition with the invincible ms._merkel
yet that be increasingly the most_likely outcome
it_' also what an overwhelming majority of germans want
many social_democrats fear be stifle as the junior partner to a powerful chancellor
but there be no shame in be part_of a grand_coalition
if the party can own up to its success it can use its coalition role to build on that record
it may not lead to victory right away but one day it could
contrary to what many seem to think angela_merkel will not be around forever
mariam lau be a political correspondent for the german weekly newspaper die zeit
stanford calif. the specter of violence cause_by mental_illness keep raise its head
the newtown conn. school killer may have suffer from the torment voice characteristic of schizophrenia it_' possible that he kill his_mother after she be spook by his strange behavior and try_to institutionalize him
we now know that aaron_alexis who kill_12 people at the washington_navy yard on_monday hear_voice many observer assume that he too struggle with_schizophrenia
to be clear a vast_majority of people with_schizophrenia a disease we popularly associate_with violence never commit violent act
they be far_more likely_to be the victim of violence than perpetrator of it
but research show us that the risk of violence from people with_schizophrenia be real significantly great than it be in the broad population and that the risk increase sharply when people have disturbing hallucination and use street drug
we also know that many_people with_schizophrenia hear_voice only they can hear
those voice feel real speak by an external command authority
they be often mean and violent
an unsettling question be whether the violent command from these voice reflect our culture as much as they result from the disease process of the illness
in the past_few year i have be work with some colleague at the schizophrenia research foundation in chennai india to compare the voice hear experience of people with_schizophrenia in the united_states and india
the two group of patient have much in common
neither particularly like hear_voice
both report hear mean and sometimes violent command
but in our sample of 20 comparable case from each country the voice hear by patient in chennai be considerably less violent than those hear by patient in san mateo calif. describe his_own voice an american matter of factly explain
usually it_' like torture people to take their eye out with a fork or cut_off someone 's head and drink the blood that kind_of stuff
other americans speak of war as in they want_to take me to war with them or their suicide voice ask_why do_not you end your life
in chennai the commanding voice often instruct people to do domestic chore to cook clean eat bathe to go to the kitchen prepare food
to be sure some chennai patient report disgusting command in one case a woman hear the god hanuman insist_that she drink out of a toilet bowl
but in chennai the horrible voice people report seem more focused on sex
another woman say male voice very vulgar word and raw
i would cry
these observation suggest_that local culture may shape the way people with_schizophrenia pay_attention to the complex auditory phenomenon generate by the disorder and so shift what the voice say and how they say it
indeed that be the premise of a new patient drive movement more active in europe than in the united_states which argue_that if_you treat unsettling voice with dignity and respect you_can change them
the hearing voices movement encourage people_who hear distress voice to identify them to learn about them and then to negotiate with them
it be an approach that fly in the face of much clinical practice in the united_states where psychiatrist tend_to assume that treat such voice as meaningful encourage those_who hear them to give them more authority and to follow their command
yet while there be no judgment from the scientific jury at this point there be evidence_that at_least some people find that when they use the hearing voices approach their voice diminish become kinder and sometimes disappear altogether independent of any use of drug
this evidence be strengthen by a recent study in london that teach people with_schizophrenia to create a computer animate avatar for their voice and to converse with it
patient choose a face for a digitally produce voice similar to the one they be hear
they then practice speak to the avatar they be encourage to challenge it and their therapist respond use the avatar 's voice in such a way that the avatar 's voice shift from persecute to support them
all of the 16 patient who receive a six_week trial of that therapy find that their hallucination become less frequent less intense and less disturbing
most remarkably three patient stop hear hallucinate voice altogether even three_month after the trial
one of those three patient have hear_voice incessantly for the prior 16 year
the more we know about the auditory hallucination of schizophrenia the more complex voice hearing seem and the more heterogeneous the voice hear population become
not everyone will benefit_from the new approach
still they offer hope for those struggle with a grim disease
meanwhile it be a sobering thought that the great violence in the voice of americans with_schizophrenia may have something to do with those of us without schizophrenia
i suspect that the root of the difference may be relate to the great sense of assault that people_who hear_voice feel in a social world where mind be so private and for the most part spirit do_not speak
we americans live in a society in which when people feel threaten they think_about gun
the same cultural pattern that make it difficult to get gun_violence under control may also be responsible_for make these terrible auditory command that much harsh
t. m. luhrmann be a professor of anthropology at stanford university and a contribute opinion writer
early this_year bobby jindal the governor of louisiana make headline by tell his fellow republicans that they need to stop be the stupid party
unfortunately mr. jindal fail to offer any constructive suggestion about how they may do that
and in the month that follow he himself proceed to say and do a number of thing that be shall we say not especially smart
nonetheless republicans do follow his advice
in recent_month the g.o.p. seem to have transition_from be the stupid party to be the crazy party
i know i be be shrill
but as it grow increasingly hard to see how in the face of republican hysteria over health_reform we can avoid a government_shutdown and maybe the even more frightening prospect of a debt default the time for euphemism be past
it help i_think to understand just how unprecedented today 's political climate really be
divide government in itself be not unusual and be in fact more common than not
since world_war ii there have be 35 congress and in only 13 of those case do the president 's party fully control the legislature
nonetheless the united_states government continue to function
most of the time divide government lead to compromise sometimes to stalemate
nobody even consider the possibility that a party may try_to achieve its agenda not through the constitutional process but through blackmail by threaten to bring the federal_government and maybe the whole economy to its knee unless its demand be meet
true there be the government_shutdown of 1995
but this be widely recognize after the fact as both an outrage and a mistake
and that confrontation come just after a sweeping republican victory in the midterm election allow the g.o.p. to make the case that it have a popular mandate to challenge what it imagine to be a crippled lame duck president
today by_contrast republicans be come off an election in which they fail to retake the presidency despite a weak economy fail to retake the senate even_though far_more democratic than republican seat be at risk and hold the house only through a combination of gerrymandering and the vagary of districting
democrats actually win the popular ballot for the house by 1.4 million vote
this be not a party that by any conceivable standard of legitimacy have the right to make extreme demand on the president
yet at the moment it seem highly likely that the republican_party will refuse_to fund the government force a shutdown at the beginning of next_month unless president_obama dismantle the health_reform that be the signature achievement of his presidency
republican_leader realize_that this be a bad idea but until_recently their notion of preach moderation be to urge party radical not to hold america hostage over the federal budget so they could wait a few_week and hold it hostage over the debt_ceiling instead
now they have give_up even on that delaying tactic
the late news be that john boehner the speaker of the house have abandon his effort to craft a face save climbdown on the budget which mean that we_'re all set for shutdown possibly follow by debt crisis
how do we get here
some pundit insist even now that this be somehow mr._obama 's fault
why can_not he sit_down with mr._boehner the way ronald reagan use to sit_down with tip o'neill
but o'neill do_not lead a party whose base demand that he shut_down the government unless reagan revoke his tax cut and o'neill do_not face a caucus prepare to depose him as speaker at the first hint of compromise
no this story be all about the g.o.p. first come the southern strategy in which the republican elite cynically exploit racial backlash to promote economic goal mainly low tax for rich people and deregulation
over time this gradually morph into what_we may call the crazy strategy in which the elite turn to exploit the paranoia that have always be a factor in american politics hillary kill vince foster
obama be bear in kenya
death panel to promote the same goal
but now we_'re in a third stage where the elite have lose control of the frankenstein like monster it create
so now we get to witness the hilarious spectacle of karl rove in the wall_street journal plead with republicans to recognize the reality that obamacare can_not be defunded
why hilarious
because mr. rove and his colleague have spend decade try_to ensure_that the republican base live in an alternate reality define by rush limbaugh and fox news
can we say hoist with their_own petard
of course the come confrontation be likely_to damage america as a whole not just the republican brand
but you_know this political moment of truth be go to happen sooner or later
we may as_well have it now
for decade soccer official in the united_states simply want some fan in their stadium
now they have them and some of those fan have bring an_unexpected problem a vulgar chant in the vein of more notoriously rabid soccer fan in other country
hardly clever it be only three word an insult direct at the oppose goalkeeper but enough to give m.l.s. official fit as they hear it spill over into live television broadcast
the chant 's simplicity be what make it appealing or appalling depend_on your perspective
it have be hear this_season at major_league soccer game in seattle sandy utah harrison n.j. kansas_city kan. and columbus ohio among_other place
it have be shout by thousand_of fan at man 's national_team game too
sport be spontaneous it_' passionate and i do_not think any of us would want_to remove that from the game say evan dabby senior director of supporter relation at m.l.s.
that ' what make it beautiful
that ' what make it enticing
but there be boundary around that beauty the league have decide
dabby this_season have oversee a new focused initiative to get club to eradicate the chant which accord_to him be neither passionate nor spontaneous
the sentiment behind the effort be not new
commissioner don garber speak out publicly against the chant last_year
before that team like the portland timbers and the new_england revolution among_others engage_in something like fan diplomacy behavioral psychology or motivational tactic or perhaps all three
their effort have reveal how a fledgling sport league try_to nurture and shape an emergent fan base
it appear to be succeed partially
the league say the chant be no_longer do in organized fashion at any m.l.s. stadium though it remain a delicate situation
what anyone can witness be progress dabby say
it be deploy in one specific game situation when the opposing team 's goalkeeper prepare to restart the game on a goal kick there be a crescendo of percussive noise and swell voice
when the player then put his foot through the ball the fan yell out the phrase in unison
the three word chant know as the y.s.a. chant be a more vulgar expression of you suck jerk
it have deep but unclear root date back at_least a decade
its form and usage be similar to one use in south america central america and europe suggest_that early m.l.s. fan who borrow heavily at first from international fan culture adopt the structure and add their_own choice word
it be a way to be antagonistic in a tongue in cheek way say dave hoyt a former_president of portland 's fan group timbers army
it get people 's attention
timber fan use the chant from about 2007 to 2009 when the club play in a minor league hoyt say before decide as a group that it be overuse
hoyt say it be not about censorship
we still have plenty_of chant that have blue language or whatever you_want to call it he say
its obscenity be the chief concern for its harsh critic
others like hoyt simply find it play out
and some particularly those expose to overseas soccer stadium may wonder_what the fuss be about
anti semitic chant last_season at a premier league stadium in england cause a scandal
racist chant direct at black player continue to be a scourge for many european league
set against these example the american chanting may_seem harmless
but jerome de bontin a former_president of the french club monaco who be hire last_year as the general_manager of the red_bulls say residual european hooligan culture be nothing to aspire to
he say he appreciate that american fan seem interested_in game rather_than create a ruckus and be disappointed when he hear the chant for the first time.â i_think it be absurd that it really do_not belong and that if we do_not take some action it would probably get bad because as more fan come to the game they would develop this false idea that it_' accept that it_' encourage de bontin say 1_2 next_page
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_20 2013a previous version_of this_article misidentified one of the city where major_league soccer fan have use a vulgar chant this_season
it be kansas_city kan. not kansas_city mo.
underwater creature and medieval knight may_seem unlikely theme for an exhibition of contemporary_art but the glyndor gallery at wave_hill be fill_with work inspire_by fish suit of armor and intersection of the two
tandem pursuits armor ichthyology present piece in a range of medium from intricate watercolor of fanciful fish to aluminum sculpture suggestive of codpiece to a video document a dress that inflate like a blowfish when its wearer feel threaten
tandem pursuits be the second in a series of program and exhibition at wave_hill a former bronx estate that be now a 28-acre public garden pay tribute to former resident
the show 's title refer_to the profession and passion of bashford dean who_live in wave_hill house one of the home on the property from 1909 until his_death in 1928
an ichthyologist specialize_in placoderm or armored fish dean be also an enthusiastic collector of armor
he be concurrently the first curator of fish at the american museum of natural history and the founding curator of the arm and armor department at the metropolitan_museum of art
bashford dean and the creation of the arm and armor department be on view at the metropolitan_museum through the fall of 2014 to commemorate the department 's centennial
visitor to the georgian revival style glyndor gallery another former home at wave_hill will encounter an intriguing assortment by 16 artist range in age from their 20 to their 80
i like to think these be work that bashford dean himself may have choose say jennifer mcgregor wave_hill 's director of art and senior curator
he probably would have be take by holly sumner 's two large_scale illustration of radiolaria tiny ocean zooplankton with spiky exoskeleton
and he may have be surprised to learn that she pursue dual interest akin to his
at the time ms. sumner start draw radiolaria she be also explore the armor gallery at the metropolitan_museum

fish also serve_as muse for ben snead who paint a portrait of dean for tandem pursuits collaged from catfish the focus of dean 's doctoral thesis
mr. snead paint the fish from image in field guide then photocopy them cut them up and arrange them as a mock up for the final piece
i divide each fish into three section head tail and body he say explain that he assign specific part to different area of dean 's face
it_' my personal classification system base_on aesthetic rather_than science
in the painting dean appear virile and impose with heavy eyebrow and a jut jaw
a different interpretation be conceive by camilla huey a professional couturier who have dress the like of aretha franklin and katy perry and an artist who combine costume and artifact to build sculptural personification of historical figure
for tandem pursuits her subject be dean and his_wife mary alice dyckman dean
mrs. dean 's portrait be a lacy corset garment with dean invoke by a fishbone emerge_from the frilly neckline
for her bashford dean portrait in a cabinet across the room ms. huey construct a jacket inspire_by japanese karuta kotes pad coat cover with chain mail and lacquer leather that samurai wear beneath their armor
refer_to dean 's ichthyologic achievement the jacket be frame by a satin representation of oversize embryonic pectoral bone with fin that reach to the floor
wander through the exhibition gallerygoers be bind to find unexpected association between fish and armor the layer of articulate metal plate like scale pattern and protective hug the body in motion
it_' interesting to see the tease out between the two ms. mcgregor say
it_' not a natural connection but once you delve into it it start to make_sense

kathleen sebelius the secretary of health and human service have be visit the state to encourage private group to help resident understand_what insurance policy and federal subsidy will be available to them when the enrollment period open oct._1

in what can be see only as an act of supreme indifference house_republicans pass a bill on_thursday that would drastically cut federal food_stamp and throw 3.8 million americans out of the program in 2014
the vote come two week after the agriculture department report that 17.6 million household do_not have enough to eat at some point in 2012 because_they lack the resource to put food on the table
it come two day_after the census_bureau report that 15_percent of americans or 46.5 million_people live in poverty
these number be basically unchanged from 2011 but in a grow economy steady rate of hunger and poverty amount in effect to backsliding
cut food_stamp would accelerate the slide
food_stamp keep four_million people out of poverty last_year and keep million more from fall deeper into poverty
under the house republican bill many of these people would be impoverished
the struggle middle_class be also fare poorly
though the unemployment_rate drop to a low of 7.8 percent last_year from a high of 9.1 percent in_2011 median_household income be virtually unchanged at $ 51,017
in a healthy economy income would rise when unemployment fall
but in today 's weak economy much of the decline in the jobless rate be not due to new hiring but to a shrink work force the very definition of a feeble labor_market in which employ people work for year without raise and unemployed job seeker routinely end_up in new job that pay less_than their previous one
even so congressional republicans have show no inclination to end the automatic budget_cut that if leave in place will lead to an_estimate loss of 900,000 job in the coming year keep poverty high and income stagnant
in_addition there seem to be little republican appetite for renew federal unemployment benefit a lifeline for million of unemployed americans when they expire at the end of 2013
it be nothing new that poor people be stuck and those in the middle_class be struggle
the poverty_rate though steady last_year have worsen or fail to improve in 11 of the last 12 year
the late number would have be bad but for double up
there be currently 10.1 million adult age 25 to 34 who be not in school and who_live with parent or others who be not spouse of cohabitating partner
if_they be on their_own 43 percent of them would fall below the poverty line which last_year be $ 11,945 for someone under age 65
similarly while median_household income hold steady last_year it be still low by 8.3 percent or $ 4,600 measure in 2012 dollar than in 2007 before the recession
and the longer the historical perspective the more dire the situation
from 2000 to 2012 median income for work age household head by someone under age 65 again in 2012 dollar fall almost $ 7,500 from nearly $ 65,000 to just under $ 57,500 a decline of 11.6 percent
against that backdrop there be no justification for savage the safety net and decimate the budget

new_jersey have some of the strong pay to play law in the country aim_at regulate the awarding of contract and other favor in exchange for campaign contribution
that have make little difference this_year for some new_jersey player who have find a backdoor way to support gov. chris christie_'s campaign for re_election
since 2005 a government contractor who donate more_than a set and very limited amount to a state campaign the race for governor for_example could lose state business as a result
the law even have an anti circumvention clause that be suppose_to keep a contractor from hide donation by send money to an outside group that then bounce the money back to a new_jersey politician
as nicholas confessore write in the new_york times this_week some new_jersey donor appear to be work around those law rather easily
at_least 15 contractor do business with the state have give more_than $ 500,000 to the national republican governors association
the governor group in turn have pour $ 1.7_million into mr._christie 's re_election effort
the association have insist it do_not earmark donation even for mr._christie who will be the group 's chairman next_year
a spokesman at mr._christie 's campaign say that everybody be in strict compliance with the law
maybe so
but the bounce from new_jersey contractor to the governor association to new_jersey deserve investigate
the citizens campaign in new_jersey which lead effort to pass the state 's pay to play law be concern
as heather taylor a spokeswoman_for the group have suggest at the very least the state treasurer should look into for potential circumvention by state contractor make these donation
in_addition the state 's election law_enforcement commission should delve into detail of what appear to be an_attempt to evade the pay to play statute
mr._christie be league ahead of his democratic opponent state_senator barbara buono and these dicey fund may not make much difference in a lopsided race

ross ramsey the executive editor of the texas tribune write a regular column for the tribune
texas republicans do_not have the problem texas democrats have there be plenty_of conservative clamor for the top spot on the ballot
but in a year when their liberal opponent be accuse them of wag a war on woman they could end_up with very few woman at the top of their ticket
it be easy to see that as a talking point especially if the democratic ticket be lead by a woman but it be difficult to tell what it may mean on election day in november 2014
many political consultant will say that female candidate outdo male candidate when all other thing be equal
others like bryan eppstein of fort_worth say the answer be more complex
gender matter less and ideology â not party but ideology â matter more he say
it_' not a general advantage or disadvantage
the contention that meg whitman a republican may have an advantage over jerry brown a democrat in the 2010 race for california governor prove to be wrong
kay bailey hutchison lose to rick perry in the republican_primary for texas governor that same year
mr. eppstein a republican attribute the win and the loss to other factor
democrats rev up by state_senator wendy davis 's sudden celebrity during and after a june debate on a contentious abortion bill see a potential advantage in top their slatewith a woman against a republican ticket where woman be scarce
in some way the political campaign on the republican side be well under_way
mr. perry say in_july that he would not run for another term and attorney_general greg abbott quickly confirm his plan to run for that job
that open the gate and the day between then and now have be fill_with political news
candidate be raise money appear at forum hug voter and kiss baby
in some way the beginning be still under_way
candidate can_not file for office until nov. 9 and they have until a month after that to make their intention officially know
democrats be still put_together their announcement
ms. davis of fort_worth say this_week that she would announce her plan oct._3 it would surprise many democrats to hear anything other than the start of her run for governor
fuzzy as that may_seem it be the clear peek into the democratic playbook
others like state_senator leticia van de putte of san_antonio be consider statewide run in 2014 but none have say anything official yet
some announcement have be in the negative mayor juliã¡n castro of san_antonio after a political cotillion at the democratic national convention last_year seem all dress up for a statewide race
but he ' not run tell_reporter and others that he still have thing to do as mayor and that he do_not think this be the right year for him
on the republican side there be woman in both of the top race at this speculative point of the game but neither be expect to slow the juggernaut john cornyn and mr. abbott
mr. cornyn the state 's senior united_states senator do_not have any well_know opponent yet in his race for re_election
the most serious threat to mr. abbott in the race for governor be the underfinanced tom pauken a former state republican_party chairman
if linda vega and miriam martinez be bona fide contender in those two race they have yet to reveal themselves
the race for lieutenant governor and attorney_general be emptyon the democratic side and stag party on the republican side
debra medina be interested_in the race for comptroller if she can pull together the resource to be competitive
the only other nonjudicial statewide race with female republican_candidate be for the texas railroad commission and no front_runner have emerge_from a field that so_far include seven republican
because the democratic candidate have not line up it_' impossible to know right_now whether they will have a similar male imbalance
any advantage attributable to gender may be too small anyhow
the best performance by a statewide democrat since 1994 be 49 percent and most result fall far short of that
the election will be define by the issue the top candidate choose to talk_about and gender could easily change the tenor of that debate

but the official_say mr._obama have not promise iran quick relief from sanction and have steer clear of any detailed proposal
mr. mohebbian and other official and analyst_say that iran be focus_on get quick relief from financial sanction because_they have cut it off from the international banking system and that in exchange it may be willing_to curb its_nuclear enrichment program
some in the leadership be also worry_that if nuclear talk do_not yield quick result iran_'s hard line cleric and military man currently sideline could attack mr._rouhani as a sellout and clip his political wing
the iranian leadership be encourage by what be describe as mr._obama 's offer to conduct face to face talk which they prefer to the more bureaucratic and lengthy negotiating process with a group of five major world power mr. mohebbian say
the one and a half page letter which the iranian president answer with a letter of similar length have kindle hope that the international charm offensive iran begin after mr._rouhani 's election in_june may produce a genuine diplomatic breakthrough

mr. yau and ms. li 's ip_man be a far cry from the hero popularly portray by donnie yen in two earlier hit movie or by tony leung as the smolder fighter in wong kar wai 's film the grandmaster

the integrity of these market be vital to the success of renewable fuel policy
but we_must remember that the environmental_protection agency just administer the tracking system for ethanol credit renewable identification numbers or rins it do_not create the credit
rins be create when people use biofuels
so the transaction of interest be not between the oil industry and the e.p.a. but between different player in the oil supply chain
astute reader will have notice that most of the program 's critic cite in the article_have tie to the oil industry
fundamentally the renewable fuel standard be about use less oil and shift to clean alternative
those goal remain
yes the e.p.a. and other regulator should improve transparency in the rin program

the israeli people once elect a prime_minister yitzhak rabin who be willing_to pursue a peace agreement that recognize the authentic aspiration of both people and who go a long_way toward achieve it before he be assassinate
there be every reason to believe_that israelis would elect such a person again if the right leader come along and there be every reason to believe_that such a leader could complete the work initiate by mr. rabin
on the palestinian side there be already a leader who have show a willingness_to pursue a peace agreement
mahmoud abbas be well aware that the palestinian people need to focus their national aspiration not on the negation of israeli goal but on create the preparatory structure for a palestinian state
and he have talk openly about the palestinians self destructive approach to the conflict
i sincerely believe_that mr. abbas remain ready to pursue peace if he can find an israeli leader willing_to engage_in permanent status negotiation
peacemaking require courageous leadership
and when such leadership be in power a peace agreement and the two state_solution on which it can only be base be anything but an illusion

to the editor_re the duty to protect still urgent op_ed sept._14 prof
michael ignatieff 's argument fail to persuade
first it do_not apply to the syria case since president_obama 's purpose be to punish president_bashar al_assad for an attack that have_already happen rather_than protect victim of continue chemical warfare
second the protect doctrine would have us abandon the rule of law
whatever its shortcoming the united_nations be an expression of the international community the ultimate source of international law
to accord_to the united_states or to any nation the right to determine when to use force strike me as a dangerous proposition
we_need to strengthen the united_nations not weaken it further
third professor ignatieff 's argument rest on the notion of american exceptionalism a belief that we americans know better_than anyone_else how and when to attack unilaterally
who have give the united_states the right to police the world
lastly syria be horrible but so be many other global spot past and present
how can a responsibility to protect principle be implement on a consistent basis

the writer be co founder and former director general of the international development law organization in rome
to the editor michael ignatieff worry_that his version_of the responsibility to protect know as r2p be face a crisis of legitimacy
his notion of r2p assert a right to violate united_nations charter rule prohibit resort to force for certain humanitarian purpose
in 2005 united_nations member reject this assertion
the member reach the decision after the hard lesson of the 2003 iraq invasion an unlawful use of force that mr. ignatieff initially support
united_nations member renew the consensus that the measure of international legitimacy be international legality
r2p have unfortunately distract academic from think creatively about how to enforce international norm like the chemical_weapon ban without resort to unlawful war
popular pressure have force our leader to look for those solution in the syria crisis and one hope beyond

both extreme position ignore the more complex reality that human choice interact_with natural constraint
the biology chemistry and physic of the earth be imperfectly understand
it be not possible to predict precisely what some human choice may lead to or whether some future environmental change may be beyond human control
it be clear however that every additional billion people constrain further the choice available for life on_earth human and otherwise
continue rapid human population growth make it hard and more costly to solve all our problem
the institutional technological and behavioral innovation that have a chance of lead to the rosy future mr. ellis envision will happen only with substantial effort and investment and will be easy with slow or no population growth

let_'s examine the reality of life on_earth today more_than a billion people live below the global poverty_rate of $ 1.25 a day one out of three people on_earth lack modern sanitation nearly 800 million face water scarcity and 18,000 child under 5 die every_day from preventable cause
we_'re alter the climate of the planet by pump billion of ton of fossil fuel emission into the air each year
the real world be already overcrowded as thousand_of plant and animal specie face the threat of extinction
technology can certainly help meet these challenge

â_â â_â
this fantasy that we can keep grow even_though earth doesn't,â recall the economist julianâ l. simon who alsoâ believe_that human ingenuity ensure_that resource would never runâ out.â

no commerce be possible without clean air clean water fertile topsoil a chemically stable atmosphere raw material for food energy and medicine and the natural processing of waste by the million of specie inhabit our soil water and air

in_2009 debra medina begin an underdog bid for governor of texas deliver one fiery speech after another to any republican club or tea_party group that would let her make the case for a platform focus_on state sovereignty gun right and eliminate the property tax
for nearly a year until her appearance in a televise debate draw national attention and energize her fund_raising the campaign sustain itself on a shoestring budget
four_year after emerge as a tea_party darling in texas ms._medina be eye the open race to succeed comptroller susan combs
but as she weigh another run she know that donation from grass root supporter can take a candidate only so_far in texas
i_'m hesitant to go out to these meeting and say i_'m run because i be not go to run underfunded say ms._medina who predict that grass root supporter could provide 30_percent of what she need for a campaign
i_think the other 70_percent be go to have to come from high wealth individual who fund campaign in texas ms._medina say
there it_' not come
her comment underscore the huge role that wealthy donor play in texas election where there be no limit on how_much an individual can donate to a candidate for a state office
with the majority of voter spread among several large medium market run a statewide campaign can be prohibitively expensive
i_think that debra medina be probably right that it_' very difficult to run a grass root fund statewide campaign for that reason say andrew wheat research director for austin base texans for public justice which study campaign financing
more_than half of most statewide official campaign account stem_from contribution of $_10,000 or more he say
ms._medina 's campaign for governor come on the heel of the birth of the tea_party movement
though gov. rick perry who ultimately win re_election quickly embrace many of the movement 's view of limited government some voter believe it conflict with his record and they turn to ms._medina in the republican_primary accord_to mark p. jones chairman of political science at rice university in houston
there_' a certain level of support she have out there mr. jones say
there be people_who remember her and identify with that wing of the party
rice university be a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune
in_july ms._medina report have $ 55,000 in her campaign account
two republicans already run for comptroller state_senator glenn hegar of katy and state representative harvey hilderbran of kerrville report war chest of $ 1.8 million and $_1 million
the comptroller serve_as the state 's chief_financial officer oversee tax collection and estimate the amount_of revenue the legislature can employ to create its next two_year budget
texas comptroller have also use the position to encourage public debate on various economic issue
ms._medina say the office be uniquely suited to her interest in influence the state 's approach to finance government over the long_term
my driver be not be in elect office my driver be change policy ms._medina say
actually drive policy where our so_call conservative leader have tell_us they_'re take it
that mix of bluntness and ideological purity be evident to voter during ms._medina 's unsuccessful bid for governor
whereas many republican_candidate have nothing but praise for texas conceal carry permit system ms._medina deride it as government interference
she continue to say that texas lawmaker defy the state 's conservative image by spend liberally and institute regulation that unnecessarily distort market
i_think that debra feel_like a_lot of conservative who back perry be not real conservative say luke macias a republican consultant whose client include several texas house member with strong tie to the tea_party
i have not see her build coalition since_then
her campaign for governor find fast momentum after a january 2010 televise debate in which she be widely view as defend her view and question her opponent better_than mr. perry or kay bailey hutchison then a united_states senator
ms._medina quickly draw more_than $ 400,000 in donation from thousand_of new supporter
it be more_than she have raise in the previous year but a far cry from the million be spend by mr. perry and ms. hutchison at the time
yet ms._medina 's standing in the race continue rise until feb. 11 when the conservative radio host glenn beck ask her whether she agree with those_who believe the government be involve in the sept._11 2001 terrorist attack
i_think some very_good question have be raise in that regard ms._medina tell_him add that she do_not have a position on the issue
her opponent immediately vilify her and her campaign never recover
ms._medina say she never mean to suggest_that she believe the government be involve in the attack only that people have the right to question their government
after finish third in the primary with 19 percent of the vote ms._medina start we texans a nonprofit that advocate many of the same position of her campaign include replace the property tax in texas with a tax on consumption
the group 's work have help ms._medina maintain a presence in the liberty movement a libertarian branch of conservatism that overlap somewhat with the tea_party and be closely identify with ron paul the former texas congressman and two time republican presidential candidate whom ms._medina count as a mentor and ally
no_matter how_much she raise ms._medina be almost certain to be outspent throughout the republican_primary mr. jones say
absent to have a credible statewide medium campaign it_' difficult to see her beat either hegar or hilderbran because_they 're_go to get a ton of money dump in their lap if_they 're run against debra medina mr. jones say
the last thing the republican establishment want be debra medina as state comptroller

in texas where oil lubricate the economy the same_way it do pickup truck energy consumption be no exception to the state 's everything be big reputation
the nation_'s lead energy producer also use more energy by far than any_other state
as the state 's population keep surge demand be expect to grow prompt leader to think_about how it will meet its long_term need
now a diverse coalition which include renewable energy advocate city official banker and others be race to institute a plan to increase energy and water efficiency upgrade that supporter say could help texas improve its conservation record and become a model for other state
we_'re such a big energy user say kip averitt a former republican state_senator who be part_of the effort
that mean our opportunity to be efficient be huge as_well
supporter acknowledge the challenge of avoid pitfall that have trip up similar effort elsewhere
the approach know as property assessed clean energy or pace address the big barrier to efficiency investment initial cost that can take year to recoup
a law allow city and county to set_up program pass this_year with overwhelming support in the legislature
pace allow the owner of commercial and industrial property to use a property tax lien to finance energy_efficiency upgrade like solar panel and water recycling system
pace program bill an owner through the lien and forward payment to a private lender
under a smooth run program property owner pay less_than what they save on their energy bill
if a property be sell the new owner would inherit the debt a rule mean to further reduce the risk of investment
tony bennett the president of the texas association of manufacturers say that after scrutinize pace his group be back the plan
we do_not like subsidy he say
we do_not like pick winner and loser
but pace be different he say and it would spur investment that could help his group 's 450 business cut cost
thirty other state allow similar financing plan though most apply only to energy unlike in texas
most of the state have stumble largely because of the objection of mortgage regulator who fear that pace lien would take precedence over mortgage if a homeowner default
and in california one of a few state that have have investment under pace observer say a patchwork of rule across city have discourage investor from finance project statewide
we have some baggage to overcome say charlene heydinger a lawyer lead the texas coalition call keep pace in texas
but she and her colleague say they benefit_from their state 's late entry to the movement and ability_to learn from others stumble
the coalition be devise what it call pace in a box a model it hop many of texas 254 county and more_than 1,200 city will adopt encourage consistency in a state that value local power
it plan to unveil the program by the end of the year and it be raise money to travel and make pitch to local government
many pace supporter would prefer the program to apply to home upgrade as_well
but by focus solely on commercial and industrial property advocate have garner support from banker
in a state where industry guzzle more_than half of the energy use and make up close to 20_percent of all the industrial consumption in the united_states the narrow focus could have an impact on energy demand
the scale here be so_much big say doug lewin the executive_director of the south central partnership for energy_efficiency as a resource base in austin
i_think texas could be a leader in energy_efficiency
baghdad as a former interpreter for the american_military and as a gay man hassan say he be a focus of frequent discrimination by his fellow iraqis
that be why hassan who ask to be identify only by his middle name because he fear for his safety do_not see any future in his_own country where he be shun for his sexuality and view as a traitor
his last and best hope he say be a visa to the united_states
but that chance be now fade for hassan and many others who work for the american_military
as they face increase violence here they find_themselves trap in a glacially pace visa program set_up for iraqis that will expire at the end of the month unless new legislation be enact to save it
the united_states be my last hope for salvation say hassan whose case be be assist by a new_york base organization the iraqi refugee assistance project at the urban justice center
it_' a place_where i can be who i be where people will accept me for who i be
that many iraqis who work with the american_military be still in the pipeline for special visa to emigrate to the united_states the state_department will not say how_many but activist estimate it be in the low thousand remain an unresolved legacy of the american war
it be also a reflection of the perilous state of the country nearly two_year after the departure of american troop the rise violence which include the remobilization of militia that once target iraqis who help the united_states have raise new fear and lead more former interpreter to apply for the program just as it be set to expire
becca heller the director of the refugee assistance group say she be hopeful that legislation would eventually be enact to preserve the program
but she be worry_that if the program go dark for even a few_month current applicant may have to start the onerous process again under a new law
senator jeanne shaheen a new_hampshire democrat who be back new legislation to save the program say we have a responsibility as americans to provide assistance to those people_who have be helpful who risk their life to help our country
and i_think we_need to make_sure we fulfill that obligation
a group of representative and senator in washington include some lawmaker who be themselves iraq veteran be hurry to save the program which be enact in 2007 and have be hamper all along by long delay because of security check
the original legislation earmark 25,000 visa over five_year and over that time roughly 8,000 have be issue
so_far this_year the state_department have issue just 454 special immigrant visa for iraqis
lawmaker say there be little actual opposition in congress but the issue have be catch in a legislative logjam and have be give little attention by many politician who would prefer to forget about the iraq war
as the deadline approach option be run out
attempt at pass immigration and defense bill that include provision for the visa program fail and now lawmaker hope to include it in a continue resolution that would keep the government run from october through the end of december
representative adam kinzinger a republican from illinois who serve two tour in iraq before enter politics be among the lawmaker try_to save the visa program
as a pilot mr. kinzinger do_not work much with iraqi interpreter
but he be move to action after read a book by dakota meyer a marine who earn the medal of honor for bravery in afghanistan
mr. meyer speak out about his interpreter 's difficulty in secure a visa to the united_states despite his have be with mr. meyer at the battle for which he be award the medal
look mr. kinzinger say in an_interview we_'re a big country
we_'re a country with plenty_of room
and when you have people willing_to fight alongside of us and put them and their family 's life in danger then we ought to repay them
about a year_ago hassan give his passport to the american embassy in baghdad and believe it would be return within a few_month with a visa
his last communication with the state_department be an automate reply to an_e mail tell_him that his case be in administrative processing and warn him that the program may expire at the end of september
he be live with a sister in northern iraq where it be safe but be still without his passport
i can_not get out of iraq at all he say
former interpreter not only worry_about their safety but say their employment prospect in iraq be bleak because of discrimination against anyone_who aid the american war effort
some see a visa as a ticket for a better life for their child
i_'m try_to give my_son the opportunity to be an astronaut if he want_to be say yousif al timimi another former interpreter catch in the visa backlog
if he ' in iraq these option be not available
if he go to the state and fail to be something important it be his fault
my job as a father be to make these option available to him
on a recent afternoon another iraqi man in a similar predicament and who also ask his name not be publish because of safety concern unzip a black briefcase and pull_out a laptop and a thick file folder contain his case document

when the mets move into citi_field five_year ago they be also as it turn_out settle into fourth_place in the national_league east and make themselves comfortable
if their season end friday they would finish in that very undistinguished spot for the fifth straight season
it would be a franchise record dubious as it may_seem for never in their uphill history have they end_up stay in the same place for so long
even in the 1960 when the mets make a name for themselves as one of the bad team in baseball history they finish 10th and last only in their first four_year of existence
in the fifth year 1966 they finish next to last in ninth
in baseball 's current division format fourth be the new ninth a home for team that be usually overmatched and not go anywhere in particular
that certainly describe the current mets who have now be in fourth_place long enough to buy a new recliner hang up some picture and get to know the neighbor hello miami marlins
thing could still change this_season although the odds be that they will not
after thursday afternoon 's loss to the san_francisco giants the mets be 68 84 three game_behind the phillies whom they will play in philadelphia this_weekend
if_they can somehow sweep the phillies then an escape route from fourth_place would actually present itself in the final week of game
that in turn may liven up what have be another dreary september for mets fan with key player injure or trade with youngster up from the minor hop to impress but maybe not_quite ready
for the mets september have become the month that will never end and when it actually do they be what do you_know in fourth_place again
they land there in_2009 with a 70 92 record that follow on the heel of two straight september collapse that cost them spot in the postseason
in the three season that follow the mets record get a little_bit better and then a little bad 79 83 then 77 85 and then 74 88 but fourth_place continue to beckon as it do again
and finish next to last in 2013 would conform with the general direction of their history
in their 51 previous season the mets have finish first just five time and dead last whether it be 5th 6th 7th or 10th place 13 time
next to last
thirteen time as_well and count
in other_word the mets have finish in the basement or right next to it for more_than half of their existence
so how_much would it matter if the mets could at_least sneak into third place by the end of september
would it make a season fill_with the usual assortment of disappointment any brighter
manager terry collins_say beat out the phillies would be a great accomplishment with all the thing we have go_through
his player do_not disagree although it be clear that the constant fourth_place finish be not the foremost thing on their mind
and what about the fan
on a recent chilly weeknight pat o'donnell 66 and his_wife eleanor sit in the upper deck of citi_field lean on a railing eye each pitch as they watch the mets lose
he wear his ron darling jersey
she wear a daniel murphy t_shirt
what about it
they be ask
would third place feel liberating
do finish fourth again bother them
they actually have a chance earlier in the season to finish second
o'donnell exclaim
he then list off all that go wrong this_year and add ah but it be not to be
he say he hop the mets catch the phillies and finish third if only because the phillies have the bad fan in the world when they come here
they get in fight he say
they_'re very obnoxious
they talk down to our fan
out in the concourse kevin kuffner 34 and his girlfriend ariana smith have step out to take a break from the game
ask about the mets be stick for what seem_like forever in fourth_place kuffner have a three world response i do_not care
i hope they spend some money in the off_season i honestly hope kuffner add sit on a bench his head down his hand clasped

even as the administration inform legislator on capitol_hill on_thursday that ms._yellen probably would be president_obama 's nominee one official_say the point of the call be not so_much to gauge support but to tell democratic senator they should defend ms._yellen if she come under attack before a formal nomination
the second even big challenge would be to manage the central_bank 's retreat from its unprecedented effort to stimulate the economy even as the nation_'s job market remain frustratingly weak more_than four_year after the great recession
with the collapse of mr._summers 's candidacy white_house official begin call senate_democrats about the fed choice a senior congressional aide say the only name they mention be ms._yellen 's
since she have become the focus of public discussion the president 's staff be worry_that she could become a target for criticism just as mr._summers be before the white_house actually nominate her and can defend her
jeff merkley an oregon democrat who serve on the senate banking_committee saidâ in an interviewâ thursdayâ that the white_house have accelerate the vetting process for ms.â yellen
certainly my impression be the white_house be take a very serious and fast track examination of her as a potential nominee mr. merkley say
while ms._yellen enjoy strong support from senate_democrats a third of the caucus take the unusual step of sign a letter urge the president to nominate her even before the white_house indicate it be lean toward mr._summers senate republicans will be more_difficult to persuade

that flexibility be something that ms._yellen may well take_advantage of
as the most_prominent member of the fed_'s dovish flank other than mr._bernanke himself ms._yellen have focus more on the dismal state of the labor_market and the pressure face poor and middle_class family than on the potential threat of financial instability and inflation down the road
in a major speech in_february ms._yellen highlight not only the elevate unemployment_rate but also long_term joblessness the high poverty_rate sluggish wage growth labor force dropout and homelessness as major reason for the fed to continue the stimulus
the effect of the recession and the subsequent slow recovery have be harsh on some of the most vulnerable americans ms._yellen say
while the unemployment_rate have fall steadily hit a five_year low of 7.3 percent in_august much of that improvement have come from worker drop out of the labor force rather_than vigorous job creation
the monthly pace of new job have slow fall from well over 200,000 new job be add each month at the end of 2012 to 169,000 in_august 2013
a more telling indicator of the continue weakness of the economy analyst_say be the proportion of americans who be part_of the labor force which in_august hit 63.2 percent a 35-year low
while some of that decline be because of structural factor like the retirement of baby_boomer and the continue shift from industrial job the trend have accelerate significantly since_2007 prompt many economist to conclude it be primarily a cyclical phenomenon that can be cure only by fast economic_growth

a sense of divine justice seize us whenever two of the world 's pretty people find each_other
this be true when taylor meet burton when brad meet angelina when paris meet helen or even when narcissus meet his reflection
we just can_not help sigh over the glory of separate soul wrap in the luxury of share beauty
then there_' that other part_of us that think both fearfully and hopefully it can_not last
such thought be inevitably stir by david leveaux 's lopsided production of romeo and juliet which open on_thursday night at the richard rodgers theater with the equally exquisite look orlando bloom and condola rashad in the title role
when these doom lover first set eye on each_other it_' so obvious that they_'re a match set and that they know it that the whole world seem to stand still in deference
though the kiss they subsequently share be long and deep it do_not feel_like the product of teenage lust
the chemistry be less erotic than aesthetic
this do_not mean that the connection be not real and it_' hard not to feel protective of porcelain figurine that be destine to fall and shatter
that one of them be white and the other black may underscore the division between their family yet it register as irrelevant when they_'re together
as a director mr. leveaux have always believe in the power of loveliness
this be the man_who give us a fiddler on the roof 2004 that look as if it have be style for a russian vogue shoot
with romeo and juliet his trust in appearance be not_entirely misplaced
mr. bloom in a first rate broadway debut and the gifted ms. rashad exude a too fine for this world purity that make their character love feel sacred
it seem right that they should speak in some of shakespeare 's most gossamer spun poetry which they do with beguiling effortlessness
yet while the production feature stunning column of flame as part_of its eclectic mise en scã¨ne it never acquire the fiery all consume urgency that romeo and juliet should deliver
cut to a fast 2 hour and 20_minute this version may well leave you glow and misty eye at the conclusion of its first_half which end shortly_after a genuinely luminous balcony scene
but the tragic event that follow pas in such an anticlimactic blur that when our hero and heroine finally off themselves it_' hard to feel bereft
feature an era straddle set by jesse poleshuck which suggest a contemporary italian city long past its renaissance glory day the show have a certain elegant sparseness
yet it also feel overstuffed visually aurally and conceptually
a giant ominous bell be periodically raise and lower ready to toll for you_know who
a well behave white dove appear for the prologue speak by brent carver who play friar laurence
and a frescoed wall its botticelli esque figure overwrite with graffiti slide in and out of view
the writing on that wall bring to mind romeo + juliet the hit 1996 movie by baz luhrmann which star a young leonardo dicaprio and claire danes and be set in a trendy beach town
and i suspect that mr. leveaux be hop to capture some of the youth appeal of that film along_with that of franco zeffirelli 's countercultural screen version_of 1968
david van tieghem 's background music cheekily quote the opening note of the earlier film 's theme song
hence we have romeo arrive leader of the pack style on a motorcycle his jean fashionably tear at the knee
fabio toblini do the costume
as a star entrance it_' both cumbersome and embarrassing though i_guess it_' mean to establish the character 's bad boy credential
in contrast juliet be first glimpse giggle her way through a pillow fight make us think of her as still very_much a little_girl
i have develop a_lot of respect for juliet 's perceptiveness in recent_year especially after see lauren ambrose 's smart and spirited interpretation for shakespeare in the park in 2007

washington only two week after washington and the nation be debate a unilateral military_strike on syria that be also intend as a forceful warning to iran about its_nuclear program president_obama find_himself at the opening stage of two unexpected diplomatic initiative with america_'s big adversary in the middle_east each fraught with opportunity and danger
without much warning diplomacy be suddenly alive again after a decade of debilitating war in the region
after year of increase tension with iran there be talk of find a way for it to maintain a face saving capacity to produce a very limited amount_of nuclear fuel while allay fear in the united_states and israel that it could race for a bomb
syria give little room for maneuver suddenly face imminent deadline to account for and surrender its chemical_weapon stockpile or risk lose the support of its last ally russia
for mr._obama it be a shift of fortune that one senior american diplomat describe this_week as head spinning
in their more honest moment white_house official concede they get here the messy way possible with a mix of luck in the case of syria year of sanction on iran and then some unpredicted chess move execute by three player mr._obama deeply distrust president_bashar al_assad of syria president_vladimir v._putin of russia and iran_'s erratic mullah
but the official_say these be the long delay fruit of the administration_'s selective use of coercion in a part_of the world where that be understand
the common thread be that you do_not achieve diplomatic progress in the middle_east without significant pressure benjamin j. rhodes a deputy national_security adviser say thursday
in syria it be the serious threat of a military_strike in iran it be a sanction regime build up over five_year
skeptic and there be plenty in the national_security council the pentagon america_'s intelligence agency and congress be not so optimistic
they think mr._obama run the risk of be drag into long negotiation and constant game of hide and seek that ultimately will result in little change in the status_quo
they argue_that the president 's hesitance to pull the trigger on tomahawk strike on syria nearly two week_ago and the public and congressional rebellion at the idea of even limit military_strike be unmistakable signal to the syrian and iranian elite that if diplomacy fail the chance of military_action order by the american president be slight
these two situation be deeply intertwine say dennis b. ross who serve_as mr._obama 's lead adviser on iran for the first three_year of his presidency and who argue for attack syria after the aug._21 ga attack that kill more_than a thousand civilian
if the syrians be force to give_up their weapon it will make a difference to the iranian calculation and would raise the prospect of some deal_with tehran
if the syrians can drag this out and give_up just a little that will send a very_different message to the supreme_leader he say
hover over it all be a third negotiation secretary of state_john kerry 's effort to jump start talk between israel and the palestinians a political minefield that mr._obama and mr._kerry 's predecessor hillary_rodham clinton for the most part avoid
all_these possibility could evaporate quickly just ask the state_department diplomat who in the last_year of the bush_administration think they be on the way to keep north_korea from add to its_nuclear arsenal or the clinton administration_official who think they be on the verge of a middle_east peace deal
mr._obama will most_likely know whether the syrian accord stand a chance of success long before he know whether the sudden iranian charm offensive be real or a mirage
the syrians now face a series of deadline
the first come this_weekend when they must issue a declaration of their chemical stock that pass the laugh test as gary samore mr._obama 's former top adviser on unconventional weapon put it earlier in the week 1_2 next_page
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_21 2013a news analysis article on_friday about the opportunity and danger present by two unexpected diplomatic initiative with the united_states big middle_east adversary syria and iran misidentified in some_edition the type_of weapon stock about which syria must soon issue a declaration

newark a new_jersey municipal judge who be also an establish stand_up comedian and actor resign on_thursday after the state supreme_court rule he can_not moonlight as an entertainer
the judge vince a. sicari say he tender his resignation after the court release a unanimous opinion that say his acting and comedy career be incompatible with judicial conduct code and essentially give him the choice of do one or the other
i_'m not surprise by the result but i be very disappointed say mr._sicari a 44-year old lawyer
i take great pride in be a judge and to give that up be disappointing
mr._sicari whose stage name be vince august have carve_out a career as a comic and actor appear on network television and in new_york city comedy club and warm up comedy central audience
he be also a part time municipal judge in south hackensack where he handle matter like traffic ticket case and disorderly person offense
several justice question_whether the public could separate mr._sicari 's position as a judge from role he have play on the abc hide camera show what would you do
in which he have portray homophobic and racist character
that quandary play a central role in the ruling on_thursday as the justice note_that someone tune into the show may not know that actor be use in the sketch
they apply the same standard for mr._sicari 's stand_up performance
in the course of his routine sicari have demean certain people base_on national origin and religion and have reveal his political leaning accord_to the court 's opinion
the court can_not ignore the distinct possibility that a person_who have hear a routine found on humor disparage certain ethnic group and religion will not be_able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appear can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceeding
mr._sicari 's lawyer e. drew britcher say his client never crack wise on the bench and never let on that he moonlight as a comic
in his comedy routine mr. britcher add mr._sicari refrain_from joke about the legal profession and never divulge his judicial job
a lawyer for the state attorney_general 's_office kim d. ringler argue against mr._sicari 's be allow to hold both job say municipal judge represent the most frequent contact that the public have with the justice_system
some of the character mr._sicari have depict could confuse the public and reflect badly on the judiciary she_say
mr._sicari of the screen actors guild and other professional performer union have say his entertainment work entitle him to health benefit and earn him more_than his $ 13,000 salary as a part time municipal judge
i_'ve be balance these profession my entire career he say
i have a passion for all of them
if i do_not have a passion this would not be a supreme_court case
mr._sicari say he would continue practice law

after a 10-year wait emirates team new_zealand and its skipper dean barker have to wait at_least one more day as they attempt_to win back the america_'s cup
their nautically minded nation be again poise to party on_thursday with a rowdy crowd gather in front of the big screen at america_'s cup park and a big crowd gather in faraway auckland to watch in shed 10 on the city 's waterfront
team new_zealand still need one more victory to secure the 34th america_'s cup but a decade 's worth of pent up angst and expectation remain unreleased
thursday deliver a one two punch to the kiwis
punch 1 come from the defender oracle_team usa which be poise and deeply impressive from the start of the first race despite face match point win by 31 second
punch 2 be deliver by the wind_limit that have turn this new age cup into an all too familiar waiting game and force the second race to be delay and ultimately call off even_though both ac72s have_already enter the start box
it be the third straight day with at_least one race postpone
the kiwis who lose the cup in auckland in 2003 lead this series 8 2
conspiracy theorist who tend_to thrive in this high stake and low disclosure microcosm may be tempt to see the delay as a way of prolong the inevitable and the merchandise sale after this regatta 's disappointing preliminary phase which begin in_july with an uncompetitive challenger series and have only now pick_up the pace
but the regatta director iain murray have simply be respond to the weather data and directive deliver to his computer on the committee boat
the current wind_limit be establish in may for safety reason after the death of the british sailor andrew simpson in a training accident in san_francisco bay and there be no agreement from the team on change
on_monday oracle propose to team new_zealand that the wind_limit to start a race be raise to 24 knot from 23 and that the fix wind speed limit in effect after the start should be remove
but team new_zealand which would have have to agree to take the proposal any further decline say the regatta be already well under_way
we_want to race that '_why we_'re here say james spithill the oracle skipper and helmsman with his kiwi counterpart barker sit_next to him at a news_conference
i_think if_you look_at the level of these two team now we be way above where we be when iain make those recommendation spithill say of murray
we have two of the world 's best team in sail out there and we have get a beautiful breeze like this in the afternoon and we have to come ashore
you sort_of ask yourself what_we 're do out here
spithill say
but it take two team to agree and if these_guy do_not want_to do it then we will just keep bump into this problem each day
there have be considerable friction between team new_zealand and oracle_team usa which be be run by russell coutts the former team new_zealand star who defect to the swiss syndicate alinghi for the 2003 cup and end_up wrest it away_from his onetime protege barker and the kiwis
coutts 's once adore compatriot have not forget
nor have oracle 's sailor forget that team new_zealand 's managing director grant dalton be particularly vocal when oracle be accuse of cheat in preliminary race in small boat
oracle end_up be hit with a two race penalty which mean that although it have win four race in this series it be get scoreboard credit for only two
we be shock with the decision spithill sad
there_' no question_about it but what can i do about it
absolutely nothing and the team can_not do_anything about it
despite the back story the wind_limit sniping be a public shift in tone for this series
barker say oracle actually argue for even low wind_limit in may before agree to the 23-knot ceiling
barker say team new_zealand be in favor of 25 knot during the may discussion but have now prepare and update its boat for the new limit
it just seem a little_bit strange that halfway through a series you feel you need to change a wind_limit that have be agree barker say
prior to race we would have agree
we just do_not think it_' right in the middle of a series
the kiwis believe_that oracle would not be argue now for high wind_limit if it do_not happen to be sail particularly well in strong condition
spithill say his team 's conservative approach in may be due to simpson 's death
it be a huge tragedy he say
but as we have both go along and i_think since the start of this regatta the confidence both team have get now and you see the racing how hard we_'re push it seem_like the team be up for it
apparently not
but spithill continue to project plenty_of positive energy and with the cup in the balance he clearly win the start on_thursday after barker and team new_zealand get too close to the line too early
spithill perform a cocksure hook maneuver to get around the kiwis and force them to tack away_from the line to avoid a penalty
oracle cross the start with a three boat length lead and never trail look particularly impressive upwind fully foil and hit speed in excess of 30 knot that once would have be unthinkable in cup racing
i_think the way the guy be sail the boat be the best we have sail it spithill say
upwind and foil in that sort_of breeze be pretty impressive and it be really just zero mistake
more much_more glitch free sailing will presumably be require if spithill and his crew be to keep postpone kiwi celebration and work toward what would be the great america_'s cup comeback in its 162-year history
because of sukkot alternate side street cleaning regulation will be suspend in new_york city on_friday
other regulation will remain in effect
boston no_one seem happy the other day than mayor thomas m. menino as he join in the ceremonial groundbreaking for a high rise tower at the site of the old filene 's department_store in downtown boston
under blue sky a brass band strike up a sousa march a forest worth of white confetti swirl down on the assemble crowd and the mayor wear a sharp new suit and tie proclaim the dawn of a new era
the start of construction celebrate the beginning of a new chapter in the history of this historic building and highlight the promising future that be in store for this neighborhood he say
it be a scene that have be repeat itself with some frequency these_day as mr._menino the city 's longest serve mayor prepare to leave office
during his 20-year tenure he have oversee the addition of 80_million square_foot of development increase the city 's total square footage of office and residential space by 11 percent
the project range_from the $_1 billion boston convention and exhibition center complete in 2004 to almost 12,000 college dormitory room
he have back a new casino he propose spend $_16 billion in private and public money to build 30,000 housing unit by 2020 and developer be plan a new residential tower at the christian science plaza that at 691 foot will become the tall residential build in the boston skyline
we call it the menino effect say peter meade director of the boston redevelopment authority which oversee all construction project in the city
as mr._menino 's time in city_hall run out the pace of development be accelerate evidence by the construction crane puncture the cityscape at virtually every turn
last_year about_$ 4 billion be invest in project this_year $ 5.1 billion be expect
the vibrant local economy fuel by growth in food service and computer relate industry with a strong underpinning in biotechnology education and health_care be drive the building boom
moody 's last_year call boston the strong commercial real_estate market in the country since the 2008 recession
those industry be grow along_with the city 's population which reach 636,000 in 2012 not as high as its_peak of 800,000 in 1950 but up more_than 3_percent since_2010
the building spree may be partly a function of mr._menino himself
three_year ago the mayor say i_want to get stuff done,'â mr. meade recall
so this be the b.r.a. be commit to get stuff do
others have suggest_that the mayor 's departure may be prompt some developer to speed_up their plan because_they expect the change in administration to slow down the process at_least initially as new people move into new job
you have the demand and interest_rate be still relatively low but this be couple with a fear of the unknown say michael k. vaughan president of nauset strategies a real_estate consulting firm
developer property owner builder have 20_year invest in this relationship he say
there_' a sense of let_'s get this stuff do because you do_not know_what ' around the corner
some of the candidate who be run to succeed mr._menino the preliminary election with 12 candidate be tuesday want him to scale_back worry_that his $_16 billion housing plan in particular could saddle the city with debt
another concern be that the building boom be gentrify some neighborhood to the point where resident be be price out
we_'re commit to so_many thing i worry we will be handcuff bill walczak one of the candidate say at a recent debate
mr._menino brush off the criticism say he intend_to finish his tenure on a strong note and would be roll_out even more initiative in the come week
after two_decade in office mr._menino 's hold over every aspect_of city life be complete and his power to make or break any construction project be legendary
the filene 's property be a case in point
a few_year ago it be be develop by vornado realty trust base in new_york but construction have stall because of the recession leave a crater in the middle of the city 's historic shopping district
the company 's chief_executive steven roth suggest_that he may have deliberately allow the site to become an eyesore to put pressure_on the city for a tax break
this incense the mayor who give no tax break
vornado never resume construction and eventually millennium partners another new_york developer but one with a good relationship_with the mayor take_over the project
on the eve_of the groundbreaking this_week the menino administration reverse itself and agree to give $ 7.8 million in tax break to help millennium partners attract retail and office tenant to the $ 630 million development
at the groundbreaking the mayor defend the tax credit say the project would generate $ 60 million in new property tax and stimulate the downtown economy
david begelfer chief_executive of naiop massachusetts a commercial real_estate development association say that market force rather_than a mayor drive a building boom
but he suggest nonetheless that mr._menino may have be think of his legacy when he propose build the 30,000 new housing unit

opponent of the bankruptcy lead by the city 's public employee union have argue_that the filing in_july violate michigan 's constitution which expressly protect pension right for worker

the city be try_to reduce an_estimate $ 18.5 billion in long_term debt
judge rhodes have so_far reserved decision on the pension and bargaining issue until formal eligibility hearing start on_oct. 23
he also order hundred_of creditor to participate_in mediation session before then to possibly reduce some of the city 's debt
but the judge make it clear thursday that he consider the testimony of resident retiree and community leader to be a key element in decide_whether detroit should be in bankruptcy and how its 700,000 resident and rank and file worker should be treat
everyone who have a stake in the outcome of this case should take the time to listen_to this the judge say
the hearing have its difficult moment
one woman lucinda darrah be remove by a security_guard when she refuse_to leave the microphone after the three minute limit
and temper flare at time when resident raise a racial issue whether mr. snyder a republican who be white have deliberately impose emergency manager on several michigan city that have largely black population

one resident jean vorkamp tell of how a gunshot victim lay dead on her street last_month for five hour because of staffing reduction in the county coroner 's_office
this be austerity she_say
and there be no more room for any more austerity in detroit
bankruptcy expert say that allow resident and retiree to testify be a prudent and compassionate move by judge rhodes but not one that will likely affect whether the city be find legally eligible to file for bankruptcy
an individual objector that do_not have a_lot of resource be probably not go to make an adequate case with sufficient evidence to overcome the city 's argument on those issue say michael a. sweet a bankruptcy lawyer with the firm fox rothschild
yet the stir anecdotal testimony of regular detroiters seem to frame the case in way far different from the legal issue at stake
cynthia blair the widow of a detroit police_officer say she rely_on her_husband 's pension to make a home for her family
the bankruptcy could take me and my_daughter 's pension away she_say
and we would be throw directly to the welfare roll
about half of the 110 individual who file objection to the bankruptcy testify on_thursday
judge rhodes say he find their statement move thoughtful and passionate and call the hearing a truly extraordinary session of the court
a second hearing on_thursday address a motion by a retiree committee represent former city worker
the committee be seek a stay of the bankruptcy and all further hearing until the michigan constitutional issue be settle
the committee 's lawyer claude montgomery argue_that the question_about the state 's protection of pension should be deal_with in federal_district court rather_than in bankruptcy court
judge rhodes indicate_that he believe the city could_not afford to squander any time in its effort to restore service and fix its finance
if we put off the eligibility hearing we delay the whole process he say
the second hearing conclude without a decision from the judge who say he would rule on the issue within a few_day

a singular divisive much debate personality sterling seem likely_to move with the yankees radio right next season from wcbs am to wfan which will simulcast the game at 660 am and 101.9 fm. if sterling return with or without suzyn waldman it will not be because he be a great broadcaster
he be frequently awful and laughable yet unforgettable in his overblown way
his return would seem to be predicate on lengthy service as a yankees homer
longevity be a wonderful asset for a local baseball announcer
it help build a fan base even_if you_'re not sublime
have bob gamere last as a yankees voice beyond his nearly forget season in 1970 he may have build a follow

he pause and then add oh it hit and kick over
but it have not go over the wall
after another pause he say i_'m sorry
i be sorry
i get that call wrong
i get that all wrong
at the wall davis make the catch
honestly i do_not think he make it

on the blue_jays radio broadcast jerry howarth say rodriguez line one up the gap and into deep right center field
move back rajai davis and he make a backhanded catch on the track
there be no visual sign that davis have give_up on the ball
kay and howarth saw the routine play clearly
sterling get it wrong in many way and delay correct himself while exaggerate davis 's nearness to the wall he make the catch as he cross onto the warning track
but at_least he apologize
what yankees management think of sterling be not publicly know
randy levine the team president would not comment thursday
whether levine and hal steinbrenner have comb through sterling 's radio archive in the past before renew his contract be unknown too
perhaps management put sterling 's faux pa and nutty shtick an a bomb for a rod in the category of phil rizzuto 's ignore play to send birthday wish to fan or leave early to beat the traffic home to new_jersey
rizzuto be endearing and beloved almost sweet

no the bat meet the ball
no he cut and hit a fly ball down the left_field line and the ball be foul
it be not a foul ball but a sharply hit ground ball
mcgehee be head toward second base as the throw come in and he ' stay at second
sterling sound a bit surprised but mcgehee have hit a ball that bounce fair over third base but land foul
the ball go down the left_field line and it must have hit it and kick in the seat for a ground rule double
the ball do_not kick into the stand and it be not a ground rule double
a supportive partner waldman say we all miss it no other tigers or yankees announcer do and add that the ball be in the air it fly over the bag
there be no fly
honest
the call be skewer the next morning by the wfan host craig carton and boomer esiason carton end their seven minute analysis with a plea to the yankees to sign sterling and waldman to a five_year deal
i can_not live without them he say
he describe their broadcast as unique
he say they produce the most colloquial broadcast ever and would be miss if_they be replace by perfectly competent announcer who would not be idiosyncratic or memorable
esiason and carton have no reason to believe back then that they would ever share a station with the yankees and possibly sterling
but next season carton be carton will_probably invite sterling into the station 's studio to analyze sterling
imagine that carton and sterling belly to belly

the obama_administration have decide to revive a controversial loan guarantee program at the energy department administration_official say on_thursday even as the program remain under congressional scrutiny after lose hundred_of million in taxpayer money on investment in fail green energy start ups like the solar module maker solyndra
this time though the program would devote as much as $_8 billion to help industry like coal and oil make clean energy
although the program which do_not require congressional approval would support a wide_range of technology it could help coal fire_power plant find a way to keep their emission from escape into the atmosphere department official_say
official_say the federal subsidy be necessary to support the development of technology that be too complex unproven and expensive for investor and private company to pursue on their_own assertion that have_already stir criticism from opponent who see the program as too risky and a misuse of taxpayer money
the program 's renewal come just as the administration be release stringent environmental rule that would severely restrict air pollution at new coal_plant
we have a real problem and that '
how do we get new technology to market?'â say peter w. davidson executive_director of the loan program office at the energy department
we partner with industry developer and entrepreneur to demonstrate a new technology at industrial scale or utility scale and hopefully once that technology be prove by deployment at scale we step out of the way and let the private debt market take_over
a spokeswoman_for the house committee on energy and commerce which be control by republicans who have be critical of the loan in the past take a skeptical view of the program
the d.o.e. loan guarantee program 's history of mismanagement bankruptcy and failure to deliver the job promise raise significant concern_about risk billion in additional taxpayer dollar charlotte baker say
we be supportive of effort to encourage the development of advanced fossil fuel technology but we be skeptical that federal loan guarantee be the best way to bring this about
analyst and climate expert also question_whether the program which be originally establish in 2005 and whose new guideline will be complete this fall could make the technology economically viable on a mass scale
there be currently no venture in the united_states that achieve this despite year of government sponsor research and development accord_to the congressional research service
an_ambitious clean coal demonstration project call futuregen propose by president_george w._bush in 2003 have yet to advance beyond the early development stage
it seem sound policy for the administration to provide these loan guarantee say paul bledsoe a former energy aide in the clinton white_house who be now a senior fellow at the german marshall fund
the real question become be that adequate to actually prompt significant number of new build and i_think that the answer so_far be no
the energy department 's loan program be create in 2005 under president bush to spur commercial adoption of innovative technology or those that avoid reduce or permanently store pollutant
in 2008 congress add another section for more fuel efficient car and a year_later create a temporary program to encourage renewable energy and electrical transmission project
that temporary program which be responsible_for the solyndra loan have since expire but the department still have about_$ 50 billion leave that could be lend with a large chunk earmark for nuclear project
the department point to several successful investment from the loan program
ernest j. moniz the energy secretary have point to tesla motors early repayment of $ 465 million as an example
mr. davidson say that since his office finance the first six large_scale photovoltaic solar farm in_2010 and 2011 10 big solar power_plant have start or finished construction without_any federal money

alton iowa the puny yellow corn stalk stand like weary sentry on one boundary of dennis von arb 's field here
on a windy day this spring his neighbor spray glyphosate on his field and some of the herbicide blow onto mr. von arb 's conventionally grow corn kill the first few row
he ' more_concerned though about the soil
during heavy rain in the summer the runoff from his neighbor 's farm soak his field with glyphosate laden water
anything you put on the land affect the chemistry and biology of the land and that ' a powerful pesticide mr. von arb say
but 20 mile down the road brad vermeer brush aside such concern
he grow traited or biotech corn and soy on some 1,500 acre and estimate that his yield would fall by 20_percent if he switch to conventional crop and stop use glyphosate know by brand name like roundup and buccaneer
in short it be just too profitable to give_up
local agronomist be start to say we have to get away_from roundup mr. vermeer say
but they_'re go to have to show me that conventional genetics can produce the same income
the local difference over glyphosate be feed the long run debate_over biotech crop which currently account for roughly 90_percent of the corn soybean and sugar beet grow in the united_states
while regulator and many scientist say biotech crop be no different from their conventional cousin others worry_that they be damage the environment and human health
the battle be be wag at the poll with ballot initiative to require labeling of genetically modify food in courtroom where lawyer want_to undo patent on biotech seed and on supermarket shelf contain product promote conventionally grow ingredient
now some farmer be take a close look_at their soil
first patent by monsanto as a herbicide in 1974 glyphosate have help revolutionize farming by make it easy and cheap to grow crop
the use of the herbicide have grow exponentially along_with biotech crop
the pervasive use though be prompt some concern
critic point in part to the rise of so_call superweeds which be more resistant to the herbicide
to fight them farmer sometimes have to spray the toxic herbicide two to three time during the grow season
then there be the feel of the soil
dirt in two field around alton where biotech corn be be grow be hard and compact
pry corn stalk from the soil with a shovel be difficult and when the plant finally come_up their root be trap in a chunk of dirt
once free the root spread out flat like a fan and be stud with only a few nodule which be critical to the exchange of nutrient
in comparison conventional corn in adjacent field could be tug from the ground by hand and dirt with the consistency of wet coffee ground fall off the corn plant knobby root
because glyphosate move into the soil from the plant it seem to affect the rhizosphere the ecology around the root zone which in turn can affect plant health say robert kremer a scientist at the united_states agriculture department who have study the impact of glyphosate on soybean for more_than a decade and have warn of the herbicide 's impact on soil health
like the human microbiome the plant root system rely_on a complex system of bacteria fungi and mineral in the soil
the combination in the right balance help protect the crop from disease and improve photosynthesis
in some study scientist have find that a big selling point for the pesticide that it bind tightly to mineral in the soil like calcium boron and manganese thus prevent runoff also mean it compete_with plant for those nutrient
other research indicate_that glyphosate can alter the mix of bacteria and fungi that interact_with plant root system make them more susceptible to parasite and pathogen
antibiotic kill bacteria or reduce their growth but some of those bacteria be useful say verlyn sneller president of verity a small company that sell sugar base fertilizer and water system and work to persuade farmer like mr. vermeer to switch to conventional crop
but research detail the adverse effect with glyphosate be limited and other study counter such finding
monsanto which sell roundup and seed resistant to glyphosate say there be no credible evidence_that the herbicide cause extend adverse effect to microbial process in soil
a team of scientist from the agriculture department similarly review much of the research and find the herbicide to be fairly benign
in response to a request from monsanto the environmental_protection agency recently increase the amount_of glyphosate that be allow on food and fee crop 1_2 next_page

washington a year after a plan by president_obama to limit greenhouse_ga emission from new power_plant set_off angry opposition the administration will announce on_friday that it be not back down from a confrontation with the coal industry and will press_ahead with enact the first federal carbon limit on the nation_'s power company
the propose regulation to be announce at the national press club by gina mccarthy the administrator of the environmental_protection agency be an aggressive move by mr._obama to bypass congress on climate_change with executive action he promise in his inaugural address this_year
the regulation be certain to be denounce by house_republicans and the industry as part_of what they call the president 's war on coal
in her speech ms._mccarthy will unveil the agency 's proposal to limit new ga_fire power_plant to 1,000 pound of carbon_dioxide emission per_megawatt hour and new coal_plant to 1,100 pound of carbon_dioxide accord_to administration_official who be brief on the agency 's plan
industry official_say the average_advanced coal_plant currently emit about 1,800_pound of carbon_dioxide per_megawatt hour
new power_plant both natural_ga and coal fire can minimize their carbon_emission by take_advantage of modern_technology ms._mccarthy will sayâ friday accord_to her prepared remark
simply put these standard represent the clean standard we have put forth for new natural_ga plant and new coal_plant
aide say ms._mccarthy would also announce a yearlong schedule for an environmental listening tour a series of meeting across the country with the public the industry and environmental_group as the agency work to establish emission limit on exist power_plant a far_more costly and controversial step
mr._obama have tell official he want_to see greenhouse_ga limit on both exist and new power_plant by the time he leave office in 2017
we will respond to the threat of climate_change know that the failure to do so would betray our child and future generation mr._obama say in_january
but he acknowledge_that the path toward sustainable energy source will be long and sometimes difficult
the limit to be unveil friday be a slightly more relaxed standard for coal_plant than the administration first propose in_april 2012
official_say the new plan which come after the e.p.a. receive more_than 2.5 million comment from the public and industry will give coal_plant operator more flexibility to meet the limit over several year
still environmental_group be likely_to hail the announcement as an_important step in target the large source of greenhouse_ga emission in the country
forty percent of all energy relate emission of greenhouse gas in 2012 come from power_plant and most of that come from coal burn power_plant accord_to the energy information administration
we be thrilled that the e.p.a. be take this major step_forward in implement president_obama 's climate action plan say tiernan sittenfeld a senior_vice president at the league of conservation voters in anticipation of ms._mccarthy 's announcement
it_' a great day for public heath and a clean energy future
but republican lawmaker and industry official have_already attack the expected proposal
opponent of the new rule argue_that the technology to affordably reduce carbon_emission at power_plant be not yet available and will drastically increase the cost of electricity
senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky the senate republican_leader and a fierce advocate for coal in a coal dependent state say in an_interview thursday that he expect the bad
although he have not see the administration_'s late proposal mr. mcconnell say it be likely_to alarm people in his state
it_' a devastating blow to our state and we_'re go to fight it in every way we can mr. mcconnell say
scott segal the director of the electric reliability coordinating council which represent power company say the detail he have hear about the rule suggest_that the administration would drive investment away_from a plentiful source of power
i_'m afraid it_' go to be illegal counterproductive from an environmental perspective and contrary to our long range interest in create job hold down cost and produce reliable energy mr. segal say
the rule on new power_plant will_soon face a 60-day public_comment period likely_to be follow by intensive industry and environmental lobbying and possible court challenge
official_say the rule could be finalize by the fall of 2014
once the rule be in place coal power_plant would be require to limit their emission likely by instal technology call carbon_capture and sequestration which scrub carbon_dioxide from their emission before they reach the plant smokestack
the technology then pump it into permanent storage underground
industry representative argue_that such technology have not be prove on a large_scale and would be extraordinarily expensive and therefore in violation of provision in the clean air act that require the regulation to be adequately demonstrate and not exorbitant in cost
i_think the agency have real problem meet both of those standard mr. segal say
but e.p.a. official argue_that the carbon_capture technology have be use in several location and that a review of the industry over the past year prove that owner of new coal fire_power plant can meet the new standard as require by the act
senator edward_j. markey democrat of massachusetts say in a statement that the propose rule would begin a new era in which the united_states begin real effort to control climate alter pollution from the nation_'s power_plant
these rule be reasonable mr. markey say
they be feasible
and they should soon be expand to include standard for exist power_plant
in one concession to the industry official_say the agency would provide some flexibility
plant that could install the technology within 12_month would be require to meet the 1,100-pound limit official_say
owner of coal_plant would also have the option of phase in the limit over a seven_year period official_say
but those plant would be require to meet a strict standard of 1,000 to 1,050 pound per_megawatt hour average over the seven_year
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_21 2013an_article on_friday about the obama_administration 's plan to enact the first federal carbon limit on the nation_'s power company refer_incorrectly to the amount_of carbon_dioxide emission from the average_advanced coal_plant

they win three of four in baltimore and go into friday 's game at boston one game out of a playoff spot
but they lose all three game at fenway park in humiliating fashion and five of the last six on the trip
we run into the red_sox wave and we have not recover alex_rodriguez say
but tomorrow be a good time to get on our home field and play some good baseball
good baseball be not something the yankees have play since their charter jet leave baltimore last_week aside from the eighth inning wednesday when they rally for four_run
the offense which manage only five_hit thursday have be stagnant and fatigue seem to be affect nearly everyone
that include joba chamberlain who give_up a three run_homer to adam lind in the seventh_inning that put thursday 's game out of reach
it be a tough road trip alfonso soriano say
you_can blame it on that
we get tired
we go home tonight and we have six very_important game at home
hiroki kuroda start and have runner on base throughout his six_inning of work
curtis granderson hit a home_run in the sixth that close the yankees deficit to 2_1 but kuroda give_up a home_run to anthony gose in the bottom of the inning that put the blue_jays ahead by 3 1
with the yankees trail by two run in the seventh manager joe_girardi summon chamberlain who have be use primarily in mop up situation in the second_half of the season
in this case the game be still competitive and the season may have be hang in the balance
chamberlain promptly give_up a leadoff walk a single and the home_run to lind
girardi explain that he do_not want_to use david robertson if possible
he have the left hander cesar cabral warm up before lind 's at bat but decide to go with the more experienced option in chamberlain
he ' be throw the ball pretty well girardi_say
but he do_not do it tonight
the yankees do_not score until granderson hit his home_run in the sixth attack a 1_2 fastball that be up in the zone and drive it into the seat in right field for his seventh home_run
rodriguez follow him and tap out to short make him 1 for 19 since the end of the series against the orioles on_sept. 12
the yankees put_together a mod rally in the ninth to score one run but it be far too late
the decisive blow of the game and perhaps the season have_already be strike by lind leave the yankees to_reflect on what permutation of their victory and their opponent loss would get them into the postseason
the yankees have six game leave at home three against the san_francisco giants begin friday and then three against the rays
the yankees must also hope that the cleveland indians the baltimore orioles and the kansas_city royals all lose
reynolds say the yankees have to run the table
soriano say they could secure a playoff berth by win eight of nine or even seven of nine depend_on what the other team do
shortstop brendan ryan who have be watch the other relevant game on his iphone at his locker after the game_against the blue_jays curse when he saw that the indians have beat the houston astros in 11 inning
it be another game that do_not go the yankees way thursday make the math even more_difficult
it_' not a time to_reflect rodriguez say
it_' a time to win game
inside pitch alex_rodriguez recover_from hamstring and calf strain take some fielding practice thursday and say he hop he would play third base before the season end
andy_pettitte say he prefer not to discuss his upcoming deposition for brian mcnamee 's civil suit against roger clemens.

the report to be issue on_friday do_not refer specifically to president_obama 's suggestion last_month that law_school may limit class to two_year and have student spend their third year clerking or practice in a firm
but it do recommend the elimination of the rule that law student must have 45,000 minute in a classroom to graduate and that they can_not get credit for field placement that be pay

â the system face considerable pressure because of the price many student pay the large amount_of student debt consecutive year of sharply fall application and dramatic change possibly structural in the job available to law graduate it say
â these have result in real economic stress on law_school damage to career and economic prospect of many recent graduate and diminish public confidence in the system of legal education
it call â the predicament of the many recent graduate who may never get the kind_of job they anticipate â particularly compelling
the report be still a draft to be distribute for comment then consider at the bar association 's 2014 meeting

the other issue where there be real disagreement be on the list of item in the accreditation standard that we think should be liberalize or eliminate
among the item on the list be â the standard on credit â for â work â before law_school matriculation distance education student faculty ratio the proportion of course teach by full_time faculty tenure physical facility and more
the overall idea say james

â mr. shepard say that there have be little controversy over the use of â nonlawyer practitioner in part â because the member be so impressed by washington state 's experiment with limited license legal technician train and license to handle certain civil legal matter
that program 's success have lead to an expansion to practitioner for domestic relation an area in which many of those_who come to court be now unrepresented

perhaps the only point on which gun enthusiast and gun_control advocate agree be that firearm should be keep out of the hand of criminal and the insane
supply a gun to someone_who subsequently use it in commit a crime facilitate and abet that crime
it follow that anyone_who supply a gun to another that be then use to commit a crime be an accessory to that crime
supply can mean sell the gun give it lend it or merely leave it out where it can be take rather_than safely lock away and include allow it to be steal by a housebreaker the source of many gun use by criminal
it may be argue_that gun_owner should not be blame for the use someone else make of their weapon but gun right supporter often emphasize responsible gun ownership
what do such responsibility mean if not keep gun out of dangerous hand
just as someone_who provide financial service or who sell or rent house be exhort to know your customer be it not the responsibility of gun_owner and those_who sell gun to take precaution against let criminal or maniac get hold of them
i propose that federal legislation be enact that would treat anyone_who supply a firearm to another person_who later use it in commit a criminal act as an accessory to that act punishable as a principal
in the case of gun that have pass through several hand as be often the case the last identifiable owner should be hold responsible

a. i_feel it have to be a girl 's view to get that one step remove
because i_think it be such a man 's world that otherwise you_can not_quite take that step back to see when certain situation have get to a certain ridiculousness or an irony
it be very easy to get lose in it
a girl can never totally penetrate this world
so it give it a chance to just have a step back and look
which i_feel be important because kate be a fan but it be also give that extra slight distance
q. do you aim to interest non f1 fan
a. i read book in industry that i know nothing about and if the story be good i also like to learn about something totally different or life in a different country
so i hope the book function on the two level one for people_who like formula_one but also for people_who like a good story and an intrigue that work
it may_seem that there could be no big contrast than that between rid a unicycle and drive the fast racing car in the world
the former be one of the slow form of wheel transportation while the latter be the fast
yet as a lifetime fan of formula_one and a longtime rider of unicycle i come to suspect that there be in fact a big connection_between the two than meet the eye
over the year i have repeatedly discover formula_one driver past and present who have ride unicycle before graduate to the big four wheel machine
the first i learn of it be when i_saw mika hakkinen rid a unicycle as he celebrate his world driver title in 1998 when he drive for mclaren mercedes
i later meet an irish former formula_one driver david kennedy who have ride a unicycle in the 1970
more recently i discover that lewis hamilton and nico rosberg who be childhood friend race rival and as of this_year teammates at the mercedes team have also ride unicycle as teenager
and last_year i_saw a short video clip of jean-ãric vergne a driver at the toro rosso team rid a unicycle when he visit the cirque du soleil in montreal
in a related vein i also know that alexander wurz who race for several formula_one team from 1997 to 2007 have win the world_championship of bmx cycling at the age of 13
so i begin to wonder_if there be some connection_between cycling balance and auto racing and i decide to investigate by bring my unicycle to the belgian grand_prix last_month
there i watch as both vergne and rosberg give it a spin around the paddock
despite their claim to have not really ride a unicycle for year both driver be_able to jump on it and ride around without a single fall to my great relief on their first attempt
i ask wurz who at 39 still compete in the top level of sport car racing and also teach race drive course to young driver at the international automobile federation the govern body of auto sport if he think there be a cycling/rac connection
if we talk of the talent of a racing driver part_of whatever talent be define will be balance skill quite a large_part wurz say
all of the driver turn_out to have very_good balance and they can use their balance skill to learn very quickly
so you would maybe see that most of the driver even_if they have not touch a unicycle very quickly get it
he be right
my recollection of learn the unicycle at about 15 be that it take me at_least two week to get it
but hamilton accord_to rosberg learn to ride his unicycle in a couple of hour
the fiercely competitive hamilton be extra motivate by the fact_that rosberg have his unicycle first
rosberg 's father keke rosberg a former formula_one driver have manage hakkinen 's career and know that the finnish driver have go to circus school and use to ride his unicycle to high_school through the snow
hakkinen be also know as something of an acrobatic formula_one driver and his skill be link to the unicycle
rosberg say that he receive his unicycle as a present for christmas
and when i get such a challenge i always make it happen he say
what he do_not count on be that when hamilton his_teammate in go karting at the time saw rosberg rid the unicycle in the paddock he have to do it too
he be the one with a unicycle and be as competitive as i be i_want to be_able to do it as_well say hamilton who like rosberg be 28
he be really good at it and then i get it and practice and practice and practice add i have to be better_than him
eventually i could do it backwards and everything and eventually he give_up
vergne 's discovery of the unicycle also have a go karting link
he learn_how to ride the unicycle at his parent 's go karting track business outside paris aim to improve his balance so that he would be a better racing car driver
i start at 14 15 year old on my_parent 's karting track say vergne 23
my_dad tell_me that it be always important to have a good sense of balance in auto racing and we think that it be a good idea for me to learn_how to do that so i learn_how to do it
he say that although he could_not feel a direct link between unicycling and auto racing he say it be clear that balance be important
balance be important to feel the car better especially in change condition of the track he say
and be a little_bit of an acrobat and know when the car be go to slide be important
wurz say it be the same with bmx.
it_' all about balance in bmx he say
it be very_much about balance and feeling the grip you have on the gravel in corner how_much speed you_can carry the jump the starting gate
cycling be all to do with use balance and a sense of gravity to your advantage
to feel the limit of the car you need to understand how_much your car be roll what your tire be do when the tire be grip and that be a balance skill he_add
still while i have not the slight doubt that if i try drive a formula_one car i would reach speed only roughly half those of these great driver i be pleased to learn that vergne and i do actually share the same technique for learn the unicycle by fall down a_lot as he say
the marina bay temporary street circuit on which the singapore grand_prix run this_weekend be the second slow track of the season after monaco with an average speed of 172 kilometer per_hour and an average cornering speed of 105 k.p.h
with its 23 corner extreme heat and humidity and night run singapore 's 106.8-mile race be one of the season 's hardest on the car brake tire and driver leave no part_of the setup unpunished
it_' a bumpy track and because it be use just once a year for the grand_prix the grip change throughout the weekend as it collect rubber from both the elite competitor car and those of the support race
that mean that the team must spend the entire weekend try_to deal_with the continually move target of the best car setup
ten of the corner be in the final sector of the track driver change gear more_than 5,000 time during the race and at more_than 100 second the lap time be the long of the year
in fact with its 61 lap the race have either reach the official two hour limit as it do last_year or go to within five_minute of the limit every year since the first singapore grand_prix in 2008
approximately 46 percent of the lap be take at full throttle compare_with more_than 75 percent at the previous race at the high speed low downforce track in monza italy
singapore 's twisty layout be hard on brake and with all the gear change on the gearbox
the marina bay circuit have a low average speed due to the high amount_of corner say remi taffin the head of the renault engine provider 's track operation
so the emphasis be on give the driver driveability through the low rev range between 8,000 r.p.m and
13,000 r.p.m
and a responsive engine on the short link between the right angle turn he say
engine map need to give good traction so this be a race we will work particularly closely with the chassis engineer to get a neutral set_up
pirelli will provide the team its medium and supersoft tire
the tight and twisty corner make the supersoft version not use since the canadian grand_prix in_june the right tire to generate traction and grip while the medium tire contribute extra durability
the second_half of the season start off with two of the fast and most demanding race for tire of the year in belgium and italy say paul hembery the director of the pirelli tire motor sport program
singapore be a completely different challenge the final street race of the season which be ideal territory for the supersoft tire he_add
as always our selection have concentrate_on provide the best opportunity for strategy as_well as the most effective race tire
because it be a long race the car carry one of the heavy fuel load of the year
that put a_lot more energy into the tire at the start of the race require particular attention to manage the first stint
one of the big cause of tire wear however be wheel spin
so the rear suspension must be set_up to give maximum longitudinal grip
unusual for a street race singapore be hot and humid with high speed heavy braking area and so_many corner
the tire have to perform well under traction and braking
the only relief for the tire be that because it be a night race the track temperature drop from a high of around 50 degree celsius 122 degree fahrenheit in the day to around 30 degree celsius 86 degree fahrenheit during the race
but that still make for a hot and humid race one of the tough of the season
twenty percent of the lap be do on braking and 45_percent at full throttle
driver undergo 2.5g 's for three second at turn 22
all the corner be generally take in second or third gear so you_'re try_to find the best setup compromise say jenson button a driver at the mclaren mercedes team particularly as you need good end of straight speed for overtake into turn 7
because it be a bumpy circuit the setup must favor the mechanical over the aerodynamic
but its slow twisty nature also require maximum downforce on both the front and rear wing
the many high curb require good suspension compliance and the frequent braking require the car to be set_up soft
brake cooling like engine cooling be difficult not so_much because of hard braking but because of frequent braking throughout the whole lap
the wear and tear be on all part_of the brake disc pad and caliper
to help cool the engine the car 's bodywork must often be open in various place
formula_one have always be an innovative force in technology for road car as the sport 's team seek quick reliable solution to create better faster car in an environment that be more competitive and evolve fast than that of the consumer car industry
in recent_year however as the series have move away_from purely mechanical to electronic system in the race car in the pit lane garage and the whole team environment of a race innovation from the series have expand far beyond the realm of the automobile
they now extend into many other aspect_of daily life from train the military and hospital operating room staff use pit stop tactic to design watch and luggage with formula_one car material and technique
one of the most advanced extension of the lesson learn through the harsh competitive environment of a formula_one race be now help to create a future that will touch on just about every aspect_of life
know as the internet of thing it have to do with the electronic connectivity of our everyday life and the vast network that have_already begin to connect everything from our car to the road to our home and hospital and even agriculture with the smart cow with biometric monitoring and analysis watch grazing rotation and milk solid data analysis
the mclaren formula_one team have even connect sick baby with their telemetry system in a hospital in britain to provide early warning of ailment like a heart attack
in fact no other team of the sport 's elite racing team be as deeply involve in the study of improve the internet of thing as be the mclaren team through its sister company mclaren electronic systems
the company which be base in britain provide the engine control unit or ecu to all of the other formula_one team and since last_year to the nascar team in the u.s.-based auto racing series
an ecu be the electronic brain of a race car that control the engine to ensure optimal performance
it also send data back to the team garage and the team factory and that be one of the link to the internet of thing
the internet of thing consist of the billion of connection a kind_of universal global neural network in the computing cloud that be expect to make almost_every aspect_of our life connect in the future
mclaren 's racing environment be branch out into the large world via its work with the freescale semiconductor company of austin texas which consider itself the internet of thing company
freescale provide the computer chip that be the brain and channel of this electronic equipment
in a report on the internet of thing by kaivan karimi a director of freescale semiconductor and gary atkinson a director at arm a british semiconductor and software company the author use one of the most_common example to illustrate the functioning of the internet of thing a toaster
your old toaster that mechanically control the color of your toast now have an mcu a micro controller in it and the mcu control the color of your toast the author write
the toaster complete its task more consistently and reliably and because it be now a smart toaster it have the ability_to communicate with you electronically use its touchpad or switch
after a device become smart through the integration of embed processing the next logical step be remote communication with the smart device to help make life easy they add
for_example if i be run late at the office can i turn on my house light for security reason use my laptop or mobile phone
that be precisely where the connection to formula_one and the ecu and other electronic sensor and telemetry of a formula_one car come into play
freescale us formula_one something of a microcosm of the wide world of the internet of thing as a laboratory for develop its chip
â» a formula_one event be increasingly one in which everything be connected just like the internet of thing say peter van manen the manage_director of mclaren electronic systems 1_2 next_page
los_angeles on_friday joseph gordon_levitt enter the rank of first_time feature director with don_jon an edgy romantic comedy he star in and also write
but in a way it_' the culmination of a direct education that stretch back to his appearance in robert redford 's 1992 big screen adaptation of the fly fishing brother in montana tale a river runs through it
the cinematographer come_up to me and say you have to hit your mark exactly,'â mr._gordon levitt say recall how at 10 such an admonition would have have him fixate on the colored tape on the floor he be mean to stand on thought of dialogue and motivation out the window
then mr. redford approach him bob say i never hit my mark.'â mr._gordon levitt whose professional acting career have begin four_year earlier and include more_than a dozen appearance on commercial and television would later realize_that mr. redford be show him how a director help a child actor give his best performance
he be put the priority back in line for me mr._gordon levitt say
it be like
yeah it_' important to try and be in the right place but let_them worry_about make the shot technically look right
your job be to focus_on the acting.'â
since_then mr._gordon levitt have absorb direct tip from all manner of gifted filmmaker
steven spielberg who direct him in lincoln teach him that a relentlessly upbeat attitude will spread to a cast and crew
you 'd think
oh steven spielberg
he must be a little blase about it by now,'â mr._gordon levitt say
but he have so_much fun all day every_day
the director gregg araki show him that with a labor of love project like the haunting 2005 drama mysterious skin meticulous preparation be crucial
christopher nolan who direct him in the dark knight rises and inception share important technical know_how like never ever use a tow rig for scene in car because the image will end_up look distractingly phony
mr. nolan also have another lesson to impart a little encouragement go a long_way
on the london set of the dark knight rises mr._gordon levitt tell mr. nolan he would just finish the first draft of a script he plan to direct as_well as star in
he do_not laugh at me mr._gordon levitt say
he just say great and then start ask_me very detailed question like what be you go to shoot it on?'â recall this exchange mr. nolan say joe 's smart the kind_of guy to wear a_lot of hat then remember pay a visit to mr._gordon levitt at warner_brothers when he be shoot a cafe scene
there he be with his trailer and his crew he seem at home mr. nolan say add with a laugh it turn_out he would get a better deal than we be ever offer
i be amazed by this
back in march when mr._gordon levitt dress in bluejeans and a striped hoodie show up at a coffee shop here in the san fernando valley he do_not come off as a crafty negotiator
but he do seem as if he be be pull in a million direction
midway_through ordering he turn his gaze across the street to his car and he realize he would forget to fee his meter
i already get a ticket he say sound downcast but only for a second
give the promising notice that don_jon receive at the sundance film_festival in_january when the title be don_jon 's addiction it would take more_than a parking citation to dampen his great mood
not only be the movie include in many best of sundance list but critic hail mr._gordon levitt 's ability_to transform his lead character the brash new_jersey gym rat jon martello who love score babe brag about his conquest and stoke his internet pornography habit into the warm center of what unexpectedly evolve_into a funny sad coming of age tale
self assure be how variety 's peter debruge characterize the actor 's filmmaking ability
one of the thing you get from him as a director be a very clear vision say tony danza who play jon 's oafish father in the film add that mr._gordon levitt 's clarity of focus as a youngster be best explain with an anecdote from 20_year ago
at the time they be both appear in an update of the 1951 classic angel in the outfield
one day mr. danza ask mr._gordon levitt to join him on one of their regular inline skate excursion around the oakland coliseum and he tell_me no today i be go to follow the director around and try and figure_out what lens he ' go to use
even as a 12-year old he be a serious kid
now 32 he be no less drive
so he would not have to cede creative control to a stable of outside financial backer he carefully conceive the don_jon script to match a spare budget
i write it to not have any explosion or scene in out space he say
he also know that in demand talent sometimes forgo big paycheck in return for the promise of fun or a challenging role
to play his gum chew dream girl barbara sugarman mr._gordon levitt land the actress he write the part for scarlett johansson and corral friend like anne hathaway channing tatum and cuba gooding jr. into make self deprecate cameo
the only near hiccup in casting have to do with julianne moore whose turn as an old woman jon meet at night school become the beat heart of the movie
her agent present the script as a movie about pornography but mr._gordon levitt say that ms. moore who have appear in boogie nights be not interest in another movie on the subject
then she read it on a plane he continue and her_husband be sit_next to her and she turn to him and say this be not about porn at all
this be about intimacy and people connect with each_other and relationships.'â
since_2009 he ' be on a win streak appear in more_than a dozen feature 50/50 looper and premium rush to name a few
he ' host saturday_night live twice
at this_year 's academy awards he make a pair of high_profile appearance deliver a nimble soft shoe with the host seth macfarlane and daniel radcliffe and photobombing two red_carpet reporter so expertly that it make him an internet darling
yet wind back about 10_year and you would find mr._gordon levitt at a different stage of popularity
in the final_season of 3rd rock from the sun the nbc sci fi comedy that put him on the map he ask to be let out of his contract so he could enroll at_columbia university
he enjoy his book tot civilian status until as a 21st birthday present to himself he buy a copy of the editing software final cut pro
he promptly fall in love
it be like i could be write this essay or cut this little video i be start to make,'â say mr._gordon levitt who drop out of columbia and return to his native southern_california to start act again
though he would be go only two_year he be treat like a has be at audition
it be a very weird part_of his career people do_not see him in that movie star way they see him now say mr. araki who be shrewd enough to notice that not only be mr._gordon levitt 's acting skill intact but that in enlist him to play a gay rent boy in mysterious skin he would also be give this still youthful veteran a chance to turn his image on its ear
normally he be the sidekick or the funny kid mr. araki say
this be one of the first_time he be cast as the sexy one
what it mean to be desirable be just one of the many theme mr._gordon levitt explore in don_jon
another be grief and mr._gordon levitt admit that he draw a character 's roiling unpredictable emotion from what he go_through after the 2010 death of his old brother daniel
it be drug relate but it be not a drug overdose as have be falsely report elsewhere in the press mr._gordon levitt say
always close the two found hitrecord a web_site that invite artist from many discipline writing animation direction edit to collaborate on project
indeed mr._gordon levitt 's project after don_jon be
hitrecord on tv a variety series start in_january on the cable_channel pivot
in part it will spotlight live action and animated short produce through the site
mr._gordon levitt will host
will it also follow a traditional variety_show format
will there will sketch cameo appearance a bit of dance
we_'re go to have all those thing mr._gordon levitt promise then offer up the muppet show of all thing as a template
it_' like a variety_show but it_' not a traditional variety_show because_they 're all muppets
this will be a variety_show but the difference be not muppets but that it_' all collaboratively make
somewhere down the line though he also plan to make a documentary_about daniel a professional fire spinner know as burning dan use the video tap conversation and photo that his_brother stockpile on hitrecord
one of daniel 's favorite thing say mr._gordon levitt be to turn on a small digital recorder and just let it run for hour and hour and hour as he talk to people
to make all sort_of stuff out of this material say mr._gordon levitt in a low earnest voice
it will be a lifelong project for me

â bernie ecclestone 82 be president and chief_executive of formula_one management and formula_one administration which own and operate the formula_one racing series
he also own a minority stake in the company
after be involve in formula_one on and off during the 1950 and 1960 ecclestone have work full_time in the series since the early 1970s first as owner of the brabham team and then as the series promoter
since the 1980 he have become the sole promoter of the business of formula_one sell television and other promotional right and negotiate race around the world with circuit owner
he have also be involve in several sale of the series culminate in the sale in 2005 to cvc capital partners a private equity firm
ecclestone speak recently in the motor home that he use as a headquarters at grands prix race with john f. burns of the new_york times and brad spurgeon of the international herald tribune
q.
there have be quite a_lot of nervousness about the state of some of the formula_one team and whether they be financially viable
a. how long have i be really in formula_one run the team
1970
myself when i have money invest nothing 's change frank williams owner of the williams team use to come and borrow money from me to pay for his engine bill
nothing ' change
you go_back to the brabham day when i really get involve in thing
dear old frank use to come and borrow money and he pay it back right on the dot
that ' how it be
there have be very rich team and team that be struggle
nothing ' change
just the amount have go up
the principle have all be the same
formula_one team owner always spend_more than they have get
and they have to find the money
q.
would it be accurate to say that there be more turnover of team in the 50 60 and 70 than there have be in the past 20_year
a.
yes
i be look the other day and i_think since 1950 when the championship start i_think there have be 54 team in formula_one
we_'re 10 now
ferrari have be around frank ' be with us mclaren ' be with us the others have come and go
q. the critic say there be not enough team that half of the team be in a very parlous financial state
and then there be more_complicated question_about cvc the venture capital company that own a control stake in formula_one and the division of revenue between cvc and the teams.â a. of which they get 62 percent
the difference be we control what_we spend and they ca n't
because if_you look_at it very few of them be business people
if_you look_at their history and what they have do it_' pretty clear
they spend too_much it_' as simple as that
all of the team in formula_one include the one at the back of the grid could and should be make a very_good profit
i can_not help them
if_you give all of them 25_percent more next_year you would be sit here with me at the end of next_year with the same story
q. i be not aware of any_other sport or indeed of any_other enterprise where the control of the commercial right have be tie up in a contract last for a century or more as it be in your 1999 agreement with the international automobile federation for the right to formula_one
and some people say there should never have be a 100-year contract that too_much power be invest in you
a. everybody be entitle to their opinion
there_' not much i can do about it
it_' because we have get a 100-year agreement that people can count on benefit_from what_we receive now
if we do_not have any agreement it would be back to the old day when i pull thing together when they would not know_what they be go to get race by race
i use to go and collect the start money for vanwall team and negotiate the start money which they do_not know they be go to get
q. you be refer_to as the tsar the dictator and so forth
do you see yourself as a dictator
a.
no i regard myself as be very lucky
i be 83 year old i be not 83 i hope i will be 83 year old and i be still alive and well and hopefully can still manage our company
q. do it worry you that people look_at you and see you as be the tsar the single dominant figure who control the finance who heavily influence every aspect_of the sport
there can_not be too_many people_who have ever hold a position in a sport such as you have now
a. i do_not know
i be sure there have be
i have never think_about it like that
i be do a job and i do the best job i can do
if_you try_to run this whole business democratically it would not work
half of the people do_not agree with each_other anyway
to get something do it would take two month where we_need an answer in two day
q. stirling moss be quote recently as say that you be the man he most admire for what you have achieve in formula_one
who be the person whom you most admire
a.
oh in our business i have a_lot of respect for obviously because he help me a_lot enzo ferrari colin chapman people_who go_back a long_way with me and be very supportive and very helpful
so i have a_lot of admiration for them
q. you be renowned as be a man_who do_not have many foible of the tabloid press kind you be not see squire around youngâ woman you do_not seem to have a taste for superfast car and this be the most mod motor home in the formula_one paddock
a. i like to think that i be very practical
this motor home do exactly what_we need
i have always get too_many thing to do
so_many thing i_want to finish they keep pile_up and never get finish
q.
what do you_want to do
what do you_want to do with formula_one
a.
there_' lot 's of different thing
do_not forget that our business be a business that really be very technical
the car be technical
i be not too excited about the current regulation
q.
the new one
a.
yes the new one
q.
so why do you allow that to happen
a. because i be not a dictator
the one that could have stop it really be ferrari

saudi_arabia appear resolute it want bashar_al assad out of damascus
the saudis view the fighting in syria with the same intensity that they do the civil_war in yemen that rag in the 1960s as a conflict with wide and serious repercussion that will shape the political trajectory of the middle_east for year to come
the syrian war present the saudis with a chance to hit three bird with one stone iran its rival for regional dominance tehran 's ally assad and his hezbollah supporter
but riyadh 's policy_maker be wary
they know that once fully commit it will be difficult to disengage
and so they be take to heart the lesson of another regional war that flare on their border 50 year_ago
the war in yemen that break out in 1962 when military leader oust the century old monarchy and declare a republic quickly turn_into a quagmire that suck in foreign power
the soviet_union provide the new regime with air support
british airstrikes aid the royalist and the united_states offer warplane in a symbolic show of force
more_than anything_else though the conflict become a proxy war between saudi_arabia which back the deposed imam and his royalist supporter and egypt 's gamal abdel nasser who support the new republic
nasser 's vision of a united arab nation free of western domination and sterile monarchy resonate across the arab world
the saudi monarchy wary of this republican fever on its border decide it be not go to stand on the sideline
the kingdom use all available mean to try_to check nasser 's ambition but it do_not send troop
by some estimate egypt send as many as 55,000 troop to yemen some of whom become involve in fight well inside saudi territory while others be accuse of use chemical_weapon supply by the soviet_union
saudi_arabia provide money and weapon to the royalist
yet neither side achieve its goal
egypt 's war with israel in 1967 lead nasser to withdraw his force but the saudis be unable_to turn the tide
riyadh be eventually force to recognize yemen 's republican government
now as then riyadh see the struggle in syria as a define moment
as the leader of the sunni muslim world it perceive an opportunity to check what it see as iranian plan to encircle the kingdom with hostile shiite dominate regime
as the war have take on a more sectarian character the usually reserve foreign_minister prince saud al faisal have describe assad 's onslaught against his_own people as genocide and syrian land as be under occupation a clear reference to the presence of iranian and hezbollah force
it be no secret that the saudis be supply element of the syrian_opposition with weapon
they all but admit as much when the prince say a few_week ago that if the international community be not willing_to do_anything then they must allow syrians to defend themselves
the saudis will use all tool available to oust assad while take measure to ensure_that the weapon they_'re supply to the rebel do_not fall into the hand of extremist
nevertheless follow the chemical attack on civilian near damascus last_month the saudi foreign_minister speak candidly about the inability of the arab nation to put a stop to assad 's campaign through force of arm add that any military effort to do so would likely involve actor outside the region
recent suggestion that the arab league should assemble a military force to check assad 's aggression do_not seem viable
disagreement among the league 's member nation have prevent it from agree to even endorse a potential u.s. strike
but on_monday the saudi council of ministers issue a strong statement make_clear that it consider prevent another chemical attack by assad to be only a short_term goal
in the long_term he must be oust
saudi_arabia will intensify its effort to arm the rebel and to use its medium outlet and diplomatic clout to rally support for a military_strike
although the kingdom be know for use its troop sparingly it have do so judiciously in the past
riyadh do for_example send troop to bahrain to show its support for the sunni regime in the face of extend mass protest
of course syria be not bahrain but neither be saudi_arabia the same country that it be in the 1960 when it fail to achieve its goal in yemen
the oil rich kingdom of today wield far great influence than it do half a century ago
there be no question that it will wield that influence forcefully support the rebel with gun and diplomacy as it struggle to outmaneuver iran outflank hezbollah and oust assad
fahad nazer be a former political_analyst with the saudi embassy in washington
washington the extraordinary zeal of the tea_party have be a signature development during barack obama_'s presidency with danger for both republicans and democrats
its white hot opposition to mr._obama see first in lawmaker town_hall meeting and then in the 2010 midterm election_campaign help cost democrats control of the house
it could yet help republicans hold their majority in 2014
the downside for republican_leader occur when that political energy propel the party to place that make it harder to win general_election and to govern
just as mitt romney struggle to avoid get drag too far_right in the 2012 presidential race speaker_john a._boehner struggle this_week to steer his caucus away_from what could be an economically and politically catastrophic government_shutdown
but some republican politician display an ability_to absorb the heat and reflect it back in more politically promising direction
that '_why 2016 presidential hopeful and house leader could learn from recent town meeting conduct_by representative tom cole of oklahoma
mr._cole a house deputy whip and a former chief of staff for the republican national committee represent a district that vote two to one republican in the last three presidential_election
since first win his southwest oklahoma seat in 2002 he have never draw less_than 60_percent of the vote
what dominate his session with constituent be as one man in midwest city describe it a sense of outrage about our government
mr._cole embrace the ideological touchstone of his constituent he say he be violently opposed to the new health_care law extol his national rifle association membership and note_that i_'ve never vote for planned parenthood in my_life
yet mr._cole also challenge unhappy constituent on tactic tone and spirit
if replicate effectively on capitol_hill and the 2016 presidential campaign trail those three guidepost could be a path toward expand the party 's appeal
â realism
some congressional colleague indulge the illusion of the party 's most fervent activist produce legislative demand that mr._boehner simply can_not meet
mr._cole do_not
for constituent urge a government_shutdown over the health_care law he warn_that it would doubly backfire by hurt local resident like the worker at nearby tinker air_force base and by heap blame on republicans
a party control neither the white_house nor the senate he say lack the power to reverse a white_house incumbent 's foremost domestic achievement no_matter how often the house vote to do so
it_' awfully hard to repeal obamacare when a guy name obama be president of the united_states he say
we_'re in a position to stop a_lot of what he want_to do
we_'re not in a position to undo
on the nation_'s long_term budget woe he encourage constituent to refocus their concern away_from emotion charge but comparatively tiny account like foreign aid and toward the vast entitlement program benefit them and their friend and neighbor
at a meeting in moore one elderly man complain_about the idea of rein in social_security by apply the chain consumer_price index to benefit calculation
instead the man ask_why do_not you put that chain on the spending
that of course be exactly what the chain c.p.i. proposal_would do
those thing be go to be on the table mr._cole tell_him note_that popular program like social_security and medicare make up 60_percent of the budget
it_' pretty easy to tell people what they want_to hear mr._cole say in midwest city add a barb for some of his colleague there_' a certain amount_of that go on in the republican_party right_now at a very high_level
â respect
a recurrent theme on the republican right be the illegitimacy of opponent
some accuse democrats of profit from vote fraud
others like mr. romney in his famous 47 percent remark insist_that large_number of democrats have grow enfeebled by reliance on government program
mr._cole sound different note
instead of deride political adversary he acknowledge their strength and grit 1

once some mobile viewing be include in the rating total mr. solomon say i_think it will start change the narrative that people be not watch tv show
it_' that they_'re watch on different platform
because nielsen rating exist mainly for the buying and selling of tv advertising time the expansion plan do_not include ad free streaming service like netflix which mainly carry previous season of show
nor do the plan initially include hulu the streaming service jointly own by the parent company of abc fox and nbc because the ad that be stream on hulu differ from the ad on tv.
but nielsen will measure online stream of show that have exactly the same ad in the same order as the tv broadcast of those show

people_who watch scandal via netflix or hulu would not
will somers the head of research at fox be encourage by nielsen 's plan
but like his counterpart at other network he hint at a little impatience he say fox hop nielsen can bring comprehensive and scalable multiplatform measurement service to market as quickly as possible

in an_interview here the vice_president of indonesia characterize high interest_rate and a weakened currency as the new_normal
boediono the country_'s vice_president who use only one name say that indonesia would face a tough international financial environment in the come month and should give great emphasis to a stable currency stable price and a stable trade balance and not just pursue economic_growth
we have be addict so to speak with an easy money environment for four_year say mr. boediono the main architect of indonesian economic_policy since the asian financial_crisis in 1997 and 1998
we know that we have to make some adjustment and maybe by next_year we have to really fully adjust to a new_normal so to speak where easy money be no_longer available
but in mumbai the new governor of the reserve_bank of india suggest_that india face less of an international threat after the federal_reserve decide on_wednesday to continue its economic_stimulus at_least temporarily
the governor raghuram rajan lower a key interest_rate on_friday by three quarter of a percent although he raise another less important rate by a quarter of a percent
india push interest_rate up sharply over the summer to make financial investment there more attractive and slow the fall of the rupee
reverse part_of that increase now will provide a boost to growth reduce the financing distortion that be emerge in the market and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheet raghuram rajan the new governor say friday at his first news_conference on monetary_policy
in monetary term india be zigging while indonesia be zagging despite the many common challenge that have pummel their currency and stock_market in recent_week
both must balance a need to preserve economic_growth for large heavily poor population while at the same_time prevent a buildup of inflation that may discourage long_term investment a tricky balancing act that have bedevil policy_maker in the united_states and other affluent country over the year

economically both have sizable current_account deficit compare to their economic output together with nearly double_digit inflation in consumer_price
perhaps most_important both face national election next_year that limit their ability_to make politically unappetizing economic decision india will elect a new parliament by the end of may while indonesia will elect a new legislature in_april and a new president in_july
the different policy outline on_friday in jakarta and mumbai reflect difference in the seriousness of their predicament however with india appear to be in considerably bad shape
while indonesia 's port and highway still have shortcoming as do the country_'s bureaucracy they be good enough that the country have emerge as one destination for the many company shift operation away_from china in response to surge blue collar wage there

be you nurse the baby again
you will spoil her
cloth diaper
the whole reason someone invent disposable be so we would not have to deal_with those
be you sure that soy formula be enough for him
he keep cry
there be nothing like the arrival of a baby to crystallize the child rearing view of everyone around a new parent especially the view of that parent 's own parent or parent in law
suddenly everyone know exactly how it should be do whatever it be
at the very least they certainly know_how they do it or how they remember do it which i have always suspect be a very_different thing
in this installment of the new parent old parent partnership between the booming and motherlode blog i the new parent be ask the question what ' a new parent to do when the grandparent give too_much advice about the baby
if a new mother nurse when her_own mother use formula or a new father carry a baby in a sling while the stroller be good enough for his dad it_' not always a simple case of different people do thing differently
when we new parent do thing differently our parent may feel judge be we reject the way we be raise
or they may have safety fear be the sling safe
be soy formula really as good as dairy
the result can range_from mild discord to the kind_of thing some new parent would consider unforgivable like slip a breastfed baby a bottle of formula or skip the car seat for just a short ride there be still some grandparent out there who consider their arm safe than the britax
but from the grandparent point of view why not share the lesson learn in the many year of parenting that lead to this moment their child hold their grandchild
there be nothing more frustrating than watch your sleepless son or daughter reinvent the wheel when you_'re certain you could help get that baby sleep more soundly or at_least more often
in fact be not that the point of new parent old parent to share that cross generational wisdom
it be but we note_that it_' far far easy to take advice when those give the advice do_not bring year of family baggage along and settle down in the guest room
as when we ask what you do when your child would not go to school we_'re ask boomer parent who have see this through to exchange idea with motherlode parent who be in the thick of it
if_you have survive the generational dispute that be so often part_of the territory for new parent and grandparent please tell_us how you smile nod and go your_own way or manage to tell your mother to take her formula stash back to the store
and if_you have be on the grandparent end and emerge with your relationship_with your child and their spouse intact what be the secret to raise your child through their_own entry into parenthood
please share your thought in the comment section and i will round up some of the most intriguing response and maybe a few of the best story and post them on motherlode next friday
then the follow week i will pass the baton back to my old parent colleague michael_winerip

in private conversation with israeli official and a few public statement administration_official have emphasize that they remain skeptical of iran_'s intention on the nuclear_program and that they will judge iran by its action not by the conciliatory word of its newly elect president_hassan rouhani
in advance of his arrival in new_york next_week for a meeting of the united_nations general_assembly mr._rouhani have signal a willingness_to negotiate an agreement over the future of iran_'s nuclear_program

there be no need to be fool by the word say a lengthy israeli statement issue late thursday in response to mr._rouhani 's nbc news interview
the test be not in what rouhani say but in the deed of the iranian regime which continue to advance its_nuclear program with vigor while rouhani be be interview
mr._netanyahu who have describe mr._rouhani as a wolf in sheep 's clothing have step up his longstanding campaign against iranian nuclear development in recent day and plan to make it the focus of a meeting with mr._obama in washington on_sept. 30 and a speech to the general_assembly the next day
while american_official have repeatedly tell their israeli counterpart that they would be cautious in their dealing with the iranian president the white_house have also make_clear that it have an obligation to test whether mr._rouhani 's expression of interest in diplomacy be genuine

senior official_say that unlike his_predecessor mahmoud_ahmadinejad he seem to have the authority from iran_'s supreme_leader ayatollah ali khamenei to negotiate on the nuclear issue
he also have a broad political mandate in iran official_say
it_' certainly different perspective look_at the same picture say dore gold president of the jerusalem center for public affairs and a former netanyahu aide
israel be clearly focused on iranian action and the message in washington seem more hopeful about iranian intention
since mr._netanyahu 's united_nations speech last_year lay out his red_line on iran and especially since mr._obama 's visit to israel in march the two country have seem in alignment

everyone on this list have become integral to this city 's dance life and between now and year 's end the work of each one can be see in new_york
perhaps only a few like the alvin ailey dancer matthew rushing have reach full maturity
the others even ms. mearns and mr. ratmansky be still evolve
it_' exciting to think that yet fine work lie ahead

for its part the taxi and limousine commission offer ride in the taxi of tomorrow a model of which have just arrive_at kennedy airport from a plant in mexico
the cab a nissan nv 200 schedule to be release next_month have be the subject of lawsuit one from a group of fleet owner who argue_that the city can_not mandate the use of a single model
anyone_who be tall would certainly wish to mandate this vehicle
as i experience when i drive around with the city 's taxi commissioner david s. yassky on_wednesday afternoon the car have so_much leg room that a person 6_foot 3 inch tall could sit comfortably on a trip from midtown manhattan to jones beach with two surfboard and a spaniel
the commission 's more significant legacy though be sure to be the introduction of its green_cab approximately 200 of which have be visible in upper manhattan and in the other borough since last_month
paint the color of granny smith apple the cab be livery that can be hail
previously this practice have be verboten
i do_not want_to be give the arecibo guy a ticket for take you home from bam mr._yassky refer_to a brooklyn car service explain
the innovation of the green_cab which have meter be mean to help solve the problem of an unequal distribution of taxi in the city with so_many concentrate in lower_manhattan and midtown and so few available elsewhere
its ancillary effect be a marginal disruption of the feudal system that bring enormous wealth to owner of yellow taxi fleet in possession of medallion that now cost more_than $_1 million apiece as driver themselves struggle to make any sort_of reasonable living
the price of a permit for a green_cab be $_1,500 for three_year make it possible for driver themselves to own them and ultimately profit from any appreciation
in_july ebony davila who have be a livery driver in the bronx for several year receive her permit for a green_cab
she begin drive it on_sept. 5 and within 10 day she have cover the cost of her permit and some additional fee she tell_me
increase passenger volume have mean that she have be make more money than she do in the past she can still take flat fee dispatch call through a service but her experience indicate how difficult the life of a driver in new_york remain the mother of a 9-year old_son she clear about_$ 840 a week after fee and leasing cost put in 10-hour day mondays through thursdays and work between 5_p.m. and 2 a.m. on the weekend
one morning last_week i accompany ms._davila as she drive on east fordham road toward the grand concourse in the bronx and through washington heights and other quadrant of upper manhattan
on the west_side green_cab driver be limit to pick_up passenger north of 110th street and on the east_side to the area north of 96th street midmorning activity be minimal
in the two hour i spend with ms._davila she pick_up one passenger in morningside heights who be go to east 72nd street
green_cab in some sense offer another lens into the vast difference_between manhattan and so_much of the rest of the city
do business in the bronx be particularly challenging ms._davila tell_me in part_because so few customer have credit_card and because so_many be accustomed to negotiate flat fee for livery service
this have leave ms._davila to focus her effort in harlem the area around columbia_university and inwood where she have do well
in manhattan people love the meter ms._davila tell_me
in the bronx they run from the meter
a few_day earlier ms._davila have pick_up a woman in westchester square in the bronx who go to burnside avenue
the 12-minute ride cost_$ 21.50 but the woman refuse_to pay more_than $ 11 because that be the cost she have be use to
other passenger have cry when they have hear their fare ms._davila say
at one point when i be with her a yellow cab driver pull up next to ms._davila and start to chat express enthusiasm_for the green_cab movement
yellow cab driver talk to her all the time now she_say often tell her that some day her medallion will be worth ten of thousand_of dollar
she obviously hop so
i_'m a single parent she_say

it_' something we be committed to address over the come year
while ryanair 's focus_on cost cutting have help it to grow it fly more schedule international passenger last_year than any_other airline shareholder say the company 's reputation for poor customer_service be limit its room for growth
i have see people cry at boarding gate say owen o'reilly a shareholder
there be simply something wrong there that need to be address
mr. o'leary who for year have play down such complaint cite statistic about revenue growth and on time departure nod as other shareholder tell anecdote about be verbally attack at dinner_party
i be very happy to take the blame or responsibility if we have a macho or abrupt culture he say

london p.g. wodehouse write in his light hearted mood would have enjoy tell the story of sir albert richardson whose possession be sell this_week at christie_'s
the collector 's pursuit of 18th- and 19th_century decorative art that once grace the aristocratic residence of britain be recount in a preface to christie_'s catalog by his grandson simon houfe
richardson who die in 1964 have belong_to a generation of stiff upper lipped britons uninclined to compromise
life at avenue house be spartan he would not allow electricity or modern convenience in the house and only with great reluctance tolerate the telephone mr. houfe muse
richardson be an extremist in traditionalism
to quote mr. houfe the family shiver in the winter and swelter in the summer make it extremely difficult to keep staff
bedfordshire the county where avenue house be locate in the small_town of ampthill get chilly in the winter
the architectural practice that richardson run at the back of his house presumably account for his love of well structured furniture
column be a recur feature in the piece that the collector seek out whether in a pair of demi lune console make around 1800 that bring â£9,375 or about_$ 15,000 or in the pediment of an octagonal table design by the famous george bullock which rise to â£73,875
but what truly rouse richardson be read the history of the past by trace its object to those_who make them or commission them
a pair of george iii perfume_burner in the shape of white marble urn with ormolu gilt bronze fitting must have overjoy the collector
the perfume_burner be so close to a sketch in matthew boulton 's pattern book that they can be safely recognize as the work of the pre eminent english manufacturer of objets de luxe in the 18th century in the word of adrian hume sayer one of the author of the catalog
orlando rock the international head of decorative art at christie_'s point_out in an_interview by_telephone that when richardson acquire the perfume_burner in 1933 little attention be give to boulton 's work
its true significance only come to light when sir nicholas goodison publish his book matthew boulton in 2002
speak before the sale mr. rock place the perfume_burner among the top lot
yet on_tuesday the pair fetch â£91,875 not even half of what another pair of boulton 's perfume_burner cost last december
true this pair which make â£157,250 at christie_'s london come from the collection of the princess mary the sister of george vi princess royal countess of harewood
the french louis xvi style that inspire boulton have be gradually fall out of favor in the last two_decade and the price difference largely reflect the premium pay nowadays for a glitzy provenance
in a striking contrast a george iii dining_room pedestal cautiously attribute to thomas chippendale more_than triple the high estimate when it go up to â£112,275
the design be in the same neoclassical vein as the louis xvi style perfume_burner credit to boulton
but the pedestal have a_lot more go for it
the figural motif be the work of a supremely accomplish albeit anonymous sculptor
better the laugh ram 's head project from the corner and the frowning mask carve halfway up the side have an expressiveness that give the piece of furniture a surrealist twist attune to current taste
what ' more the inside metallic fitting which have be preserve instead of make room for shelf to transform the pedestal into a pier cabinet make it a museum piece
sadly few among the item amass by richardson benefit_from such advantage and the sale have its ups and down
a set of six georgian armchair from the 1780 closely follow french louis xvi model cost â£20,000 miss the low estimate by a wide margin 1_2 next_page

in her insistence on recognize the social value of religion rather_than merely disparage it as superstition for sap ms._macbain operate very_much in sync with her bos greg m. epstein the humanist chaplain at_harvard
in his 2009 book good without god and in a subsequent 50-city speak tour mr. epstein espouse the creation of secular community
by hire ms._macbain he have put nonbelieving boot on the ground
the purpose of these community mr. epstein write in an_e mail be to help us connect with one another more deeply to spur us to act in the interest of the common good and to change the way we think_about value and purpose in a world where traditional religion be no_longer vital for us
we_'re not try_to build antireligious group the intention be more to answer_question about alienation isolation economic justice and political and environmental sustainability fight back against religious privilege only when necessary
everything in her life prepare ms._macbain for such a role
she grow_up a pk a preacher 's kid and savor the role
she tag along_with her_father on hospital visit
she go with him to class at bible college
she sing in the youth choir and teach sunday school
she also strain to accept the theology of her_father 's baptist faith which reserve the ministry for man
for me the lesson be that doubt be sinful and wrong she_say
if_you have these_thing come_up you suppress them you ignore them you pray them away
this natural inquisitiveness and questioning be just wrong
and if i do them i be displease god
for me life be about be the person_who love god and want_to be everything god want me to be
that just carry me on through decade
grow into adulthood however ms._macbain run aground on what seem_like irreconcilable message in scripture
in first corinthians alone for_example verse 14:34 instruct woman to be silent in church while verse 11:5 refer_to woman pray and prophesy
if text be divinely inerrant as ms._macbain have be teach how could both statement be true
she try_to solve her dilemma and answer god 's call by become a pastor in the more theologically liberal methodist church in the early 2000s
yet despite her sense of purpose in aid the needy despite her professional pride in a well prepared sermon her doubt never subside
they ultimately lead her to write that letter just before easter 2012
an atheist would never believe in providence so let_'s just say that by very welcome coincidence ms._macbain find herself speak at the american humanist association convention one month_later with mr. epstein in the audience
after she finish her address use the character in the wizard of oz as example of how to build community he approach her
i can_not believe you just say those thing she recall his have tell her
i_'ve be work on them for 10_year
then he describe the humanist community at_harvard which be previously unknown to her
he be in the process of raise its annual budget to $ 500,000 from $ 28,000
and his immediate goal be to hire a point person to assist nascent congregation of nonbeliever
seven week_ago move from tallahassee to cambridge ms._macbain become that person
without know it at first she_say of herself and mr. epstein we be on the same page see the desire of people atheist humanist nonbeliever who want_to connect into a community and do_not know_how
within the free thought world the secular world it_' desire but the resource to build it have not be there

he be wear dark long sleeved shirt in all of the photo which be take by video camera in the restaurant and in the hotel
in one image he appear to be wear glass
the police say it be not clear whether he be actually disabled or whether the wheelchair be in effect merely a disguise
either way it apparently let him reach for a purse that have be carefully stow under the bar at nobu 57
and on_friday customer there and hotel guest at the marriott marquis be intrigue by what they consider his creative and brazen modus operandi
how could he do that ask miriam ngom an advertising manager from paris who be look_at e_mail as she sit on a bench in the lobby of the marriott marquis with its glass wall elevator and atriumlike layout
you never know who you_can trust
she have stash her_own tan gucci purse out of sight beneath the sleevelike purple carry case for her laptop computer

accord_to the video camera there be a person in a wheelchair see approach where she be stand and then he leave
we have an image of him come near the person in question and we have an image of him leave the hotel
sergeant ryan say the bandit ride off with the woman 's wallet and about_$ 300 in cash along_with her ipad a necklace and a pair of sunglass
he grab a bag that be lie on an_empty chair at havana central around 9:45 p.m. on_sept. 3

the theft at nobu shortly before midnight on_aug. 30 yield credit_card key and cosmetic say sergeant ryan add that the 34-year old victim have not realize_that her bag be miss until she reach for it later on
the man have roll in close to ask a question at the long onyx and walnut bar say the restaurateur drew nieporent who operate nobu
i_guess that ' when he make the move he say
the woman do_not have the purse on the back of the chair that ' problematic we warn people about that
but in front down under the bar
mr. nieporent say the man do_not order anything
i_think it be quick he say
he size up the place see what he need and get out of there
still when a reporter strike up a conversation on_friday about the theft one woman at the bar lift her purse off the empty bar stool next to her and place it in her lap
another woman marvel_at how the suspect must have maneuver on his way in and out
if somebody come near me in a wheelchair the first thing i do be grab my purse so it would not get run over say a woman at the bar at nobu 57 on_friday afternoon between call and text_message on her two cellphone
but late at night everyone 's drunk
they wo_not notice
it_' not like at noon when everyone 's sober
stratford upon avon england visitors to shakespeare county raceway during the annual yanks weekend could be forgive for think they have stumble into a regular sunday meet at a typical american dragstrip be it not for the british accent and license plate that_is and the track name ' incongruous association with the playwright bear a few mile down the road
among the racecars present last_spring be some hallmark of americana include a 71 chevrolet camaro call the bootlegger and a 57 bel air with honky tonkin'â letter on its door
a show n shine event feature dozen more detroit product restore to original condition and park amid tent and camper on the grassy ground of a former royal air_force base in warwickshire
even in this setting which emphatically favor speed over style norman dawood 's 1949 cadillac series 62 club coupe draw a crowd of admirer
i have other classic car say mr._dawood who own such quintessentially british automobile as a 1966 aston martin db6 and a 1963 rolls royce silver cloud iii.
but no other car get anything like the look that this one get
when mr._dawood a londoner who run a translating and subtitling business saw the black fastback on ebay list by a seller in new_jersey he buy it without hesitation
with characteristic understatement mr._dawood admit that the car be a bit of an impulse purchase
like many fan of the big american car that british enthusiast call yank tanks mr._dawood be particularly draw to cadillacs from 1949 which be the second model year to feature the auto industry 's pioneering foray into tailfin
discreet compare_with the tower appendage that arrive a decade later the fin have be inspire_by a clandestine look_at the lockheed p-38 lightning a fighter plane with twin tail give to general_motors designer work on the 48 model
it be the 49s however that be first to be fit with a new 331-cubic inch overhead valve v-8 which become a standard bearer for g.m. the engine 's considerable power can still be feel on the highway where mr._dawood 's car easily keep up with the flow of modern traffic
mr._dawood 's club coupe also know as a sedanette lack power steering but have several option include a hydra matic transmission which add $ 174 to the 1949 sticker price of $ 2,966 as_well as power window and seat
befit a cadillac it be fit with the modern convenience of its day include a cigar light multiple ashtray and enough headroom for a driver to wear his fedora
it be impractical to keep a behemoth 49 cadillac in london where compact car ply narrow road so mr._dawood store it here about 100 mile to the northwest
that it be a sunny day so uncharacteristic of a british spring when he drive it to the yanks weekend be fortunate as the driver 's window be stick open its power lift mechanism have give out
the window malfunction be emblematic of a series of small problem some potentially incapacitating that plague mr._dawood 's cadillac and indeed many of the american classic increasingly buy on the internet by british collector
the american car scene in the u.k. be just grow and grow because of the internet say john pryor president of the national_association of street clubs a co sponsor of yanks weekend
more people be buy classic american car now because_they can fix them more easily and we_'re now see dedicated shop open up here say mr. pryor who recently trade in his 1959 vauxhall victor for a 56 chevy
while the cadillac be en route from the united_states mr._dawood find a copy of a british magazine classic american
i could_not believe my eye he say
on the cover be a car identical to the one i would just bought belong_to some scottish earl
the article be about a guy who specialize_in restore american car and i_think this be brilliant

cherry jones be one of the great stage actress of her generation
though she be probably best_know for her emmy win portrayal of president allison taylor on 24 watch her on television be nothing like watch her in the theater her sweep unconstrained by a camera
jones win her first tony award for her role in the 1995 revival of the heiress base_on the henry james novel washington square
her transformation from the diminished daughter of a cruel father to an expert in cruelty herself be a master class in voice and movement
her second tony come a decade later for john patrick shanley 's pulitzer_prize win doubt
her_sister aloysius the nun who suspect a priest of sexually molest a boy be as terrifying as you would expect it be her humanity that surprised
now jones be back on broadway as amanda wingfield a frantic single mother whose husband abandon the family year_earlier in tennessee_williams 's glass menagerie
zachary quinto play her alienated son tom celia keenan bolger be laura his disabled pathologically shy sister and brian j. smith be jim laura 's gentleman caller
both jones and the production direct_by john tiffany receive raf earlier_this year at the american repertory theater in cambridge mass.
it will open at the booth theater on_sept. 26
last_month i talk with jones a tennessee native in her greenwich_village apartment before the company reassemble for rehearsal
it be a sunday afternoon and she wear jean and no makeup
for serious actress there be no great challenge than master amanda 's complexity her desperation over her_daughter 's future her frustration with her_son 's disaffection her obsessive reverie of the past
it seem the perfect place to begin
alex witchel
be amanda wingfield a character familiar to you
cherry jones
she be nothing like the southern lady i grow_up with
i find her almost freakish compare to the southern woman i know
a.w. how so
c.j. i grow_up with a creative practical english teach mother and i find amanda to be kind_of abhorrent to tell you the truth
and the play be so depressing
this be where it get embarrassing because clearly i lack the depth and experience to appreciate the play for the masterpiece it be and the woman for who she be because now i have nothing but respect for amanda wingfield
john tiffany talk me into do a reading of it and afterward i just as we say in paris tenn. squeal like a pig under a gate
i_realize what an extraordinary gift it would be to get to play her
a.w. you would see the play before
c.j. i have see glass more time than i_think i have see any play and of course the reason be not because i_want to but because all my_friend or actress i greatly admire be play amanda
my not want_to play her have more to do with the fact_that i just do_not think i be capable of it
i do_not think in cambridge i come close
i gain over the course of the last three_year since my_parent die a good deal of weight
so when i find_myself about to begin glass menagerie i once_again attempt_to quit smoking and i gain even more weight
i_feel because of the extra weight i make her almost too aunty like
oh i should not be say any of this
a.w. why not
c.j.
well because this be for me to work on the next few_week and month and not to be talk_about
i_guess i be try_to say it will be interesting now that i have shed a few stone to see how that affect my playing of amanda
i_think it will and i sha not say another word on that subject
a.w. i read that as a lead lady you also lead the company and that you do it well
you have be know to blast the soundtrack of patton to get everyone motivate before a show
c.j.
i use to do that to get me go occasionally
i always think of myself as be part_of the ensemble
but because i be now usually the old and usually have the leading role i_guess that add up to be the lead lady of the ensemble
this thing about age be so heavenly with these kid because celia zach brian and i be extremely close
we fall on one another like puppy in a box from the moment the four of us get together
as we know the glass menagerie be one of the most intimate quartet in dramatic literature
they make me feel_like a dear friend but occasionally they will write to me and say dear mama and it_' be a treasure for me as a childless lesbian at this point in my career to have this relationship_with them
a.w. tell_me your ritual once performance start 1_2 3_4 5

editor sheila glaser
reply me its very import the subject line demand bossy and impatient
before i even open the message blink over my morning coffee i know where this be go
for a couple of year now i have receive e_mail from complete stranger solicit my opinion on deeply private matter
the content of these query vary widely but there be always telltale sign they be almost always write by nonnative english speaker they all claim as this one attempt_to be important and they always describe a conundrum solicit my direction on what to do
the first_time i receive such an_e mail i assume it be a mistake and ignore it
i ignore the next few e_mail as_well but i begin to wonder_if someone be play a prank on me
the e_mail keep come sporadically and without_any hint of a setup or any sign of a punch line
eventually i discover the explanation
my surname mufti be an arabic word mean one who give a fatwa
in islam the prescribed path to salvation the shariah be really know only to god
muftis be scholar task with decipher god 's will on a give matter from the ancient and profound to the modern and rather mundane which insurance plan to choose what financial investment to make
about 500 year_ago i be tell some of my ancestor be employ as mufti in the court of a muslim emperor in south asia
though i be bear in the american midwest and mostly attend american school my name remain a vestigial marker of my ancestor profession
i google mufti one day and scroll through the result a wikipedia entry a few dictionary definition and a web_site with a parade of man in tight pant and flashy sunglass from a kitschy indian designer
the link to my personal web_site sit at the top of the second page of result
i be the first flesh and blood mufti if only in name you encounter if_you be desperate enough to be look for one on the internet
this e_mail with the pushy subject line be unlike any_other i have receive
my_friend who_live in sweden want_to get marry to a swedish woman it begin in latinized urdu
but this marriage will be a fake marriage
tahir the sender explain that his friend be already marry to a woman in pakistan but want_to marry a swedish woman to obtain swedish citizenship
tahir 's friend want him to deliver fake pakistani divorce paper by forge both his and his_wife 's_signature
oblivious to the forgery the swedes would allow tahir 's friend to marry put the secret bigamist on a path to swedish citizenship and all that it offer
i doubt that either of the woman be privy to the elaborate scheme
it be tahir 's heedlessly narrow question at the end that surprise me the most
if i forge the signature on the divorce paper will that really mean my_friend will be divorce from his_wife
it be this small rather arcane detail about god 's view of the marital bond that nag his conscience not the various international and domestic law and criminal code that he would break
would you do me a favor and resolve this problem
the fate of several man and woman scatter across the world be thrust into my hand
the only thing i know for certain be that this would not be a victimless crime
so for the first_time ever i begin type out a response to such an_e mail my first fatwa
i list the law that tahir would break and the people he would hurt if he go_through with his friend 's scheme
do_n't do it i write
but then i delete it all
this be not a fatwa
tahir 's question be specific as it should be in a fatwa request
stray from this would just expose me as an impostor a novice mufti a hack
so i try again
yes i write out in latinized urdu
if_you sign all_these paper and send them to your friend in sweden this will actually lead to a divorce in the eye of allah
allah do_not differentiate between real and forge divorce paper
i_feel my_heart pound terrify at the ease of my lie and their power to steer the course of others life
as my finger hover over the send button i_feel something tighten around me and like tahir i be paralyze by the decision in front of me
i save the message in my draft folder where it sit today
i_wish there be someone out there anybody who could tell_me what i should do
for the first_time ever i_feel the need for a fatwa

be it ethical to buy something at a yard sale or a flea_market at the seller 's asking price if_you know the value of the item to be significantly high than what be be ask
let_'s say for_example someone be sell an old comic_book worth thousand_of dollar but ask for only a quarter because he or she do_not know the true value
be it incumbent on the seller to do his or her research
if the seller do_not be it fair game
ryan atlas boston
the operative word in your question be true directly place before the word value
you suggest the true value of a specific comic_book be a few thousand dollar but all that mean be someone may be willing_to pay that much for it base_on extrinsic quality rarity for_example
to the person run the flea_market the true value of the comic_book be virtually nothing
there be no true value for any object it_' always a construct provisionally define by a capricious market and the locality of the transaction
thing cost what they be be sell for and they_'re worth whatever the seller can get
it_' unethical for a seller to knowingly take_advantage of someone 's practical desperation in a crisis say sell d battery for $ 75 a pack during a citywide blackout but it_' not unethical for a buyer to accept whatever arbitrary value a seller place on his or her good
look_at it like this let_'s say the person at the flea_market be sell that same rare comic for $ 2,000
you however would be willing_to pay far_more than that because of its sentimental value and the status it will bring among your comic_book collect peer you would gladly fork over $ 5,000
would you feel the need to inform the seller you_know i would actually pay you $ 3,000 more_than what you_'re ask
i do_not think you would and no_one would expect you to
now this do_not mean it_' ethical to take_advantage of people simply because_they 're uninformed about the arcane detail of modern commerce
if_you 're visit an elderly neighbor and notice he ' use a 1909 honus wagner baseball card as a bookmark for his bible you_can not casually offer to buy the card for $_1 in the hope that he wo_not know any better
you_can not proactively look for way to swindle people
but thing change when somebody decide to put a nonessential item on the market the person look_at an object create an imaginary value for what it be worth and ask for the equivalent of that fabricate value in currency
if the number be too high no_one will buy it if the number be too low the seller leave money on the table
but people do_not inherently deserve the maximum potential price for whatever they_'re try_to move
if that ' what they desire they have to get it for themselves
e_mail query to ethicist@nytimes.com or send them to the ethicist the new_york times magazine 620 eighth avenue new_york n.y. 10018 and include a daytime phone number
in 1904 the cooper underwear company run a magazine ad announce a new product for bachelor
in the before photo a man avert his eye from the camera as if embarrassed he have lose all the button on his undershirt and have safety pin its flap together
in the after photo a virile gentleman sport a handlebar mustache smoke a cigar and wear a bachelor undershirt stretchy enough to be pull over the head
no safety pin no button no needle no thread run the slogan aim_at man with no wife and no sewing skill
someone in the u.s. navy must have see the logic in this because the following year the quartermaster 's_office specify that sailor should wear undershirt with no button under their uniform soon thousand_of man become acquaint with the comfort of the cotton pullover
though the cooper underwear company popularize the crew neck shirt they do_not invent the style
the shirt evolve out of the long john that man wear in the 19th_century when a number of garment maker experiment with method that would allow the fabric to stretch over the head and then snap back into shape
in the 1890 the cotton pullover still look_like underwear to most people and wear it in public be consider scandalous
lawmaker in havana go so_far as to ban the public display of any underwearlike top and so laborer have to toil in the heat wear long sleeve shirt with button
but gradually the crew neck catch on
in 1920 the garment be reborn under another name thanks partly to f. scott fitzgerald
accord_to the oxford english dictionary the author be the first to use the word t_shirt in print it appear in the novel this side of paradise in a list of accouterment that a character carry with him to board school
fitzgerald seem to have assume that the idea of a t_shirt so name presumably because of the shirt 's shape would be familiar to reader and that they would associate it with the white flannel bareheaded youth of new_england prep school
by the 1940 t_shirt have become ubiquitous in high_school
a newspaper columnist name nancy pepper write that teenager own closet full of t_shirt and customize them with sew on patch and fringe
she report that some high_school boy even use their t_shirt to advertise that they be available for make out session around the neckline of their shirt the boy inscribe the word neck here
zz top jacques van gool be the owner of backstage auctions an online auction house that specialize_in rock memorabilia
do you sell a_lot of t_shirt
yes t_shirt have become legitimate collector item
i will never forget when jennifer aniston put on an mc5 shirt
do you suddenly see a jump in sale or auction price when that happen
absolutely
keep in mind it_' not unusual to see a 1970s shirt for as little as $_25
but you also find them for $_1,000
some of the most desirable shirt to collect be shirt that be exclusively make by the promoter for the staff that be work a specific concert
let_'s say the academy of music in new_york in 1974 have a show with alice cooper and the promoter print up 30 shirt just for the staff
obviously that shirt be valuable
what be the most you have ever get for a t_shirt
around $_1,500
that be an original fillmore west shirt that be wear by a band member of frank zappa
and it come with unquestionableâ provenance because he ' wear the shirt on one of frank zappa 's album
i assume you collect a few of your_own
i have a zz top 1975 crew shirt that i_love
be it valuable to you because of the memory
that shirt specifically
no
i buy it as part_of a collection
as for the shirt with memory for me i have old kiss t_shirt that i be partial to because kiss be the band that get me into collect back in the 70
anything_else we_should know about t_shirt collecting
i be fascinate by how we have supersized our society
a large t_shirt in 1970 seem really small now
everybody be skinny and shirt be tight back then
the garment industry have change the size almost_every 10_year
the shirt be wide and longer now
when we do our auction we always make_sure that we specify the dimension
you measure a shirt from pit to pit and from the top of the collar to the bottom
and we have to let our customer know the true size because_they could buy a large and end_up with something tiny
dip_into the comment the american text genre of the moment and you_can sense the current that move american life
the comment be where the real america be someone once write in a comment thread
comment also may be the most obnoxious development of the web the wild back alley where people sound their acid yawps
their tenor be now so bad that last november a game designer shane liesegang set_up a twitter feed @avoidcomment where he tweet thing like i once show a comment section to a man in reno just to watch him cry
he now have 27,000 follower
when we complain_about comment i have notice we do so as if we_'re deal_with some emanation of human nature or the lusty democratic energy of the american soul
but when i go dig into the history of the web to find out where online comment really come from it_' clear that they_'re the consequence of what be technically feasible at a certain point and how that feasibility be subsequently implement
we tend_to think that comment represent the culture but in fact the distinct culture of comment grow out of digital constraint
give what web user have to work with comment be bind to get weedy
comment as we know them line of text stack atop one another in chronological order be direct descendant of bulletin board system or b.b.s. which date to the 1970 user could dial in with a modem and contribute to discussion forum
the computer code that determine the order in which text appear on a b.b.s. also provide the basic architecture of the comment thread
that code or script become the basis for an early commenting function call the guest_book a place for simple text entry in which any visitor could type a note
guest_book be attach to the web_site as a whole not to any specific content on it
this create confusion about the sort_of opportunity that the guest_book present
be it the soapbox of the online world
or be it a bathroom wall
fray.com a popular web_site start in 1996 which use freeware guest_book script be among the first to harness the potential of the guest_book
a question would be pose and answer contribute by reader would be publish in real time
the web_site be essentially a collection of guest_book each one with a prompt and the reply be all stand alone contribution adrift in a sea of other people_who be speak to themselves
it_' difficult to give credit for the invention of comment as we now understand them to one specific person or site
an interactive book travel with samantha which allow reader to submit comment via a form much as modern comment be win a best of the web award for document design in 1994 which be the same year that a consortium of world wide web developer create w3 interactive talk to discuss technical matter on which discussion point be submit by a form that make them part_of a topic page
there be compete claim about the first blog to offer comment
one pioneer be bruce ableson who create open diary in 1998 an internet journaling project that allow diarist to respond to one another 's entry
around the same_time the software developer dave winer create a discussion board with a comment feature
the first comment there arrive on_oct. 5 1998 too bad coder can_not be like rock star and get their money for nothing and their chick for free
as the web evolve the simple top to bottom arrangement of autonomous line of text have a huge influence on the culture of comment and it now feel as natural as have sidewalk on two side of the street
but the typical web page present a hierarchy
at the top be the article post video or image while the comment dangle underneath like suckerfish from an indifferent shark
have the comment at the bottom of the page people feel that they feel they_'re not as legitimate a voice as the original post say travis nichols who moderate a poetry foundation blog for several year and draw on this experience to write a novel the more you ignore me whose belligerent narrator take_over a cooking web_site with a venomous lament
commenters show up with an immediate grudge nichols observe they know they have be relegate to the steerage class of the public discourse
as a result commenters become territorial
when we have to be more aggressive in delete comment that violate our comment policy say bill adee the chicago tribune 's vice_president of digital operation i get far_more complaint_about delete comment than i do about the level of discourse

the global elite 's favorite strongman jeffrey gettleman describe rwanda 's president paul kagame as authoritarian and repressive
but as someone_who have study collective trauma in rwanda i believe_that kagame 's policy be a psychologically valid response to the challenge of rebuild the social fabric of rwanda post genocide
it be a basic principle of trauma psychology that for people to deal_with past event they must feel safe in the present
kagame 's social policy have create a sense of security that will make it possible for rwanda to move_forward
carl auerbach professor ferkauf graduate school of psychology at yeshiva university new_york
for those of us who_live in rwanda it be puzzling to see others call kagame a dictator
how do an oppressive regime lift more_than one million_people out of poverty in less_than five_year
how do kagame ensure universal health_insurance and primary education make the country one of the safe and clean in the world create one of the most business friendly environment on the continent and enable an average g.d.p. growth of 8 percent for the past five_year

western leader talk_about stop the next rwanda in syria but what about stop the rwanda in congo
it_' difficult for kagame to credibly negotiate for territory within the boundary of congo

but he pitch a long time and win a_lot and that make him an indelible yankee great
i_'ve have the success that i have have because of so_many great player that have be around me pettitte say friday in announce that this would be his final_season
do i_feel like i have dominate this sport as a pitcher
no i do_n't
every outing for me i_feel like have be an_absolute grind to tell you the truth
when i look_at lineup and team that i be face it seem_like every hitter 's hit .300 off of me you_know
it be vintage pettitte the moment in his news_conference when you smile and laugh a little because you_know the sincerity behind the self deprecation
it be mostly true too
not only do pettitte never pitch a no hitter but he also never pitch a one- or a two hitter
opponent bat .270 off him
the league average over his career .264
pettitte have easy day like all good pitcher but not many
his self evaluation be accurate
what separate pettitte be the way he keep push himself to find a way out of trouble pull that cap down and fight
he know that the bad punishment he could give himself would be to disappoint his_teammate an unpardonable sin
we laugh at him because he '_always yell at himself and talk to himself on the mound derek jeter say friday
it_' fun watch him beat himself up because he expect to be perfect
nobody ' perfect but he have those expectation and that ' the reason why he ' have so_much success
it be fitting that pettitte 's most impressive statistic be his win percentage .627 at 103 game over .500
win and loss be often out of a pitcher 's control as more and more young pitcher recognize
if_they work seven inning allow two run and lose they understand they have still do a good job
pettitte never believe_that
it be comical indeed to listen_to him berate himself after such game know that have the offense score a few more run his outlook would have be so different
pettitte accept all the responsibility as he do in 2008 for his use of human growth hormone the blot on an otherwise sterling reputation
i know my_heart and i will tell you i have never try_to cheat this game pettitte say friday
pettitte retire once before for the 2011 season
he say friday that he would have stay retire have general_manager brian cashman not call him the next_spring
he intend_to pitch only in 2012 but when he lose most of that season to a break leg he come_back
all along he say he have know this would be it
he let another retire yankee mariano_rivera have the spotlight all season in every city and say he plan to retire with a simple announcement the day_after the season
over lunch with rivera in toronto this_week pettitte decide to make the announcement now
it_' great rivera say
it_' give him a chance to say thanks to the fan
bar a miracle playoff berth pettitte will pitch his final home game as a yankee on_sunday when the team honor rivera
jorge posada last play in_2011 choke up by his locker after the playoff finale
only jeter will remain from the title team of more_than a decade_ago assume he pick_up his player option as he have say he intend_to do
it_' be a long hard year say pettitte 41 who be 10 10 with a 3.93 earn_run average
i can_not be happy with my decision
i have be retire and i know_what it_' go to be like
it_' awesome and i_love it
jeter who turn 40 in_june have never seem tempt by retirement
he come_up in 1995 like pettitte rivera and posada but unlike them he have no wife or child
baseball may not be his entire life but it be all he let the public see and he have make no concession to age
if jeter 's ankle bother him this winter as he prepare_for the season you have to wonder_if he would put himself through another year like this which he have describe as a nightmare
it be not in jeter 's nature to want a gauzy farewell tour and it_' no fun for him to be a figure of sympathy
jeter rightly say that it be unrealistic to ever expect another foursome of long_term mostly one team star to reach the major together
you always need to have an influx of young_player come in and help organization he say
that ' how we be_able to be successful and i_think that ' how any organization can continue or maintain success throughout the year
the yankees however do_not appear to have any star on the immediate horizon
if_they do those player would have be among the 56 to suit up for the team this_season
compound the problem be the team 's goal to reduce its bloated payroll
rivera and pettitte clear salary by leave and in some way that help
but mostly they leave an organization at a point of deep uncertainty content with their decision and secure in their legacy
it just feel right pettitte say
i just feel_like my time here be do
my run ' over
moscow russia 's federal security_service announce on_friday that it have seize a greenpeace international ship and its crew after a series of protest at an offshore oil rig in the arctic ocean and that it would tow the ship to port in murmansk to conduct an investigation
the seizure of the ship on_thursday night which be carry_out by armed border_guard drop by helicopter threaten to escalate into a diplomatic confrontation since the crew include citizen of several country include one american
russia 's ministry of foreign affairs have_already issue a protest to the dutch ambassador because the ship the arctic sunrise be register in the netherlands and greenpeace international be base there
the federal security_service which oversee russia 's border_guard say in a statement that the ship have be seize under law govern russia 's exclusive economic zone and that its activity would be report to the country_'s investigative committee for possible criminal_charge
the committee 's regional branch in a separate statement say it be consider charge of piracy
the ship be seize in international water near the prirazlomnaya platform in the pechora sea not far from the island of novaya zemlya
the platform own by the state control energy giant gazprom be the first offshore oil rig in the arctic
it be complete last_year and be expect to begin pump oil next_spring
greenpeace have send its ship to the area last_month to protest what it consider to be the risk of drilling for oil in such an environmentally fragile and largely unspoiled region
on_wednesday two of the ship 's activist manage to scale the rig and be detain prompt the initial russian diplomatic protest
the border troop have also fire several warning shot during protest but no_one be injure during the storming of the ship on_thursday night accord_to the security_service and greenpeace
even so the head of the organization 's arctic oil campaign ben ayliffe say the seizure be unprecedented
we have no idea why they_'re be hold he say of the ship 's crew
be they be charge
why be they detain our ship in international water
the security_service say 27 people be on board include 4 russians
greenpeace say the crew total 30
the reason for the discrepancy be not immediately_clear
greenpeace official in moscow who have monitor the ship 's activity from a war room in the organization 's_office say there have be no contact with the crew since thursday_night and no official response from the authorities beyond the security_service 's statement on_friday confirm the seizure
accord_to greenpeace at its current speed under tow the ship will arrive in murmansk on_monday
before communication be sever the activist have report that the troop who board the ship behave quite correctly but bureaucratically the soviet way say vladimir chuprov a leader of greenpeace russia
in its statement the security_service know by the initial f.s.b. say a search of the ship have uncover a large collection of photographic and video equipment and small boat suggest unauthorized activity against russia 's national_security though it do_not explain the significance of the discovery
what the f.s.b. be do now be not to protect the national interest mr. chuprov say in an_interview in the organization 's moscow office
instead he_add refer_to major energy company now explore the possibility of an energy boom in the arctic the threat to the national interest be in the office of gazprom rosneft shell bp or whatever
for the past 12 year since his laud esther story peter orner have be engage_in a strange quiet and wonderful experiment
he have write four work of fiction two novel and two story collection all compose of canny snippet that build with subtle accumulative power to create book autobiographical in feel if not_necessarily in fact
in all but his first novel the second coming of mavala shikongo the book return to the same character from startle vantage point orner be write in spiral move restlessly out to embody imagine character but always return to the chicago and fall river mass. family of his most frequent first person narrator a young_man who be roughly his age
in each of his book orner 's crystalline sentence and his ability_to pay close and sustain attention to small moment transform the ordinary element of each story into an even more astonishing whole
last car over the sagamore bridge orner 's new collection be compose of 52 story most no_longer than a few page
there be many strand run_through the weave of this book one be a series feature the above mention family another be a group of italicize first person story another imagines people outside of the central character/narrator 's experience like a woman who sell television antenna in a mexico_city plaza and a serbian woman sit in a coffee shop
yet_another strand observe famous people mary todd lincoln richard j. daley ted kennedy geraldo rivera and isaac babel one of many writer with whom orner be in conversation
chekhov be another clear influence as be the evan s. connell of mr. bridge and mrs. bridge novel write in the same episodic manner orner favor
at his strong orner can nail interior monologue in a way that recall grace paley
just listen_to the voice of walt kaplan a character who also appear in esther story and in the novel love and shame and love would my head be a head of lettuce
i drive the last car over the sagamore bridge before the state police close it off
the cape cod canal all atempest beneath
no car come no car go
the bridge cable flap like rubber band
you think in certain circumstance a few thousand foot of bridge be not a thousand mile
a writer who keep return to the same subject run a big risk
the reader can feel_like an invisible observer in a room wall with mirror watch the author fascinate by the endless reflection of himself
just when you think he ' finish examine this interesting feature here it be again from a different angle
when orner return too_often to the same beat or idea he can almost reverse the effect of his true gift which be the ability_to take element we have see before the historical character the suburb the tight knit jewish family chicago and by the force of his fascination make them thrillingly strange
this talent never fail orner yet when he look too_often at the same loss or character or mood he teeter on the verge of return the strange back to the familiar
where would we be though without writer who take great risk
they be the interesting one to follow from book to book
sometimes the risky writer stumble in his funambulist guise and you wonder_if he ' about to dive into the drink
in last car over the sagamore bridge orner be especially daring with structure
though the collection be organize into four loose section base_on what i interpret as loss murder longing and what remain after loss it_' difficult to understand_why these story have to appear in the same book
the leap from historical character to internal narrative to apparent transcription make a reader a little dizzy
most great story collection jesus son by denis johnson twilight of the superheroes by deborah eisenberg variety of disturbance by lydia davis contain story that feel as if_they must be together through character thematic refraction or just a barely detectable urgency
they develop subtle argument from beginning to end
though every story in last car over the sagamore bridge be excellent incisive move
the collection as a whole never_quite coheres there be 52 passionate argument be make in the 52 story but a person come to orner for the first_time may feel that each story be mostly argue with itself
luckily there be other way of read story collection than in a single linear sweep
a reader could dip_into this book anywhere go for a walk and come_back later to be move differently
or a reader could and perhaps should also read the collection as an integral part_of a much great whole one still expand and contracting and coiling inward a living and breathing project that be evolve in a way that uncannily mimic memory or life itself
lauren groff be the author most_recently of the novel arcadia
like most writer i have one particular thing i can_not stop think_about wonder about and in my case it_' the animating spirit of a thing what_we also call the soul

and so you add regal bearing to the picture you see of miss vicks and loosely an era the late 50
the 60
early 70s time and place form as you read along and then come a phrase that make the form stutter
it_' after dinner when the blue green light of the scow those slow move herald of melancholy would begin to appear in the night sky
scow
be not that a type_of boat a barge of some_sort
scows in the sky
but now the dog be sniff around one of the tree the way dog do so you think to yourself maybe scow be another word for blimp like the goodyear blimp that pass over your street in the early 1960 and you feel the melancholy you experience as a 10-year old girl sit on your front porch on a summer night read message the blimp flash along its side that have nothing and everything to do with you
and miss vicks feel her childhood too feel all the miss vickses that have ever be layer inside her like tree ring around heartwood
the chapter be call body-â­without soul the book be call duplex and you have live in a duplex so you think
oh i know_what this book be about
there be parent who drink highball and play canasta as darkness well up and the firefly come_out
there be kid name eddie mary carol roy who wear t_shirt and plaid short trade card and sticker they keep in cigar box play ball in the street and when a car come speed toward them with headlight blaze the kid yell head up and scatter
now the year be fix in your head
it_' 1966 for sure
the only difference be the kid on your street yell car
and then you read this the car be expensive and silver gray and drive by the sorcerer body without soul
and you find out not only do miss vicks know him they be romantically involved and he can make thing vanish or vibrate at unprecedented frequency include her private he can sow fear inside anything and then you read that he can fit his entire hand inside her
time stutter
what
his entire hand what
you read the phrase four time try_to catch_up the way you try_to catch_up when you be a kid and henry the teenager from next_door tell a bunch of you a story about his finger and a girl
finger
girl
what
then a flood of understanding horrify you sham and excite you trail you back into the house to the kitchen where dinner be ready where your chicken potpie be wait to be pierce with your fork and you star at it
oh
a scow be not a blimp
real woman mean something else entirely
and though he drive a car and his name turn_out to be walter the sorcerer be not a real man
he look_at the street but he do_not see the kid he see it crawl with soul like the earth with worm
it be no secret that even the lowly of the unruly uncontainable being live there could partake of love 's mystery and his envious rage know no bound
the real and the unreal be laminate so tightly in duplex you find yourself suddenly lose you do_not know where or when this book take_place you do_not know_what this book be about at all
and that be how it take you in
when i finish duplex i have the unshakable feeling that i would only read half of the book and the other half be still in there and if i_want to finish it i would need to read it again
i be not wrong
by then i would fall in love with davis 's writing what it do to me that combination of horror and excitement that spill out of the book into my past into the now into everything around me
the novel be pack with ordinary thing tuna casserole skinned knee hot water heater red barrette and extraordinary thing robot the size of needle dactilo port in restroom those fly scow and then there be thing that fall somewhere in between the word aquanaut a purse shape thing call a mary bean that can drift across the ocean to other continent a convent name after a girl who be roast on a brazier 1_2 next_page
lynda barry be a writer cartoonist and assistant_professor of interdisciplinary creativity at the university of wisconsin madison
in the national consciousness harlem have usually be define by two era the artistic and cultural explosion of the 1920s know as the harlem_renaissance and the drug fuel devastation that begin in the 1950 and peak in the late 80
the harlem_renaissance have be well document by its poet novelist and essayist as_well as by a legion of scholar in the decade since
the long depressing ghetto year be recount most eloquently by james baldwin and by less mortal like sociologist memoirists politician hollywood screenwriter and rapper
today 's white harlem of multimillion-â­dollar brownstone and flashy eatery be already the subject of book blog and innumerable magazine travel article
in her book harlem nocturne women artists and progressive politics during world_war ii farah jasmine griffin a professor_at columbia_university delve into a largely underexplored aspect_of harlem 's rich history the year just before during and immediately after world_war ii a period of optimism creativity and turmoil
moreover griffin use the life of three female artist the choreographer and dancer pearl primus the writer ann petry and the composer and pianist mary lou williams as signpost through an era in a work that paint the great generation in a much less flattering light than do the usual jingoistic account
griffin 's narrative encompass the war and the second great migration of black to the north from the south
she also highlight two movement that will be less familiar to contemporary reader the double v or double victory campaign in which black americans fight
overseas for their country but also to be recognize as citizen at home and the popular front initiative conceive by the communist_party in response to the economic_crisis of the great depression and the rise of fascism
for black people griffin write of double v the war provide an opportunity to accelerate their demand for equality
black americans highlight the distance between this ideal of america and the reality of ongoing racial inequality often through the black press and civil_right organization
the popular front meanwhile focus_on culture as an especially important forum for educate and mobilize audience in support of an antifascist agenda
although by 1939 its official end have come the idea of it would continue throughout the war year
without popular front venue like cafe society or publication such as pm a leftist newspaper it be doubtful that petry primus and williams could have meet with such success
griffin argue_that her three main subject consistently confront the darkness of our nation_'s soul
they be critical of white supremacy and the excess of american capitalism
yet their art and their activism also denote a firm belief in the transformative nature of social change
none of these woman be native new_yorkers
primus be bear in trinidad and as a child relocate with her family to the city where she be expose to afro caribbean dance the innovation of martha graham and the sweaty swing style popular at the savoy ballroom
as an adult primus fuse these movement with her_own impressive physicality
her ability_to leap majestically high make her popular and john martin the new_york times dance critic praise her tremendous inward power fine dramatic sense and superb technique
of the three woman in griffin 's narrative primus be the most progressive politically join the communist_party when it be still one of the few organize white movement to challenge jim crow and the violence that feed it
the f.b.i. open a file on her in 1944
petry be never a communist but be publish in popular front periodical and serve_as woman 's editor columnist and feature editor at the harlem newspaper the people 's voice a left lean enterprise publish by adam clayton powell the pastor and new_york city_councilman

time have not be kind to the white woman who participate_in the harlem_renaissance
as philanthropist and activist author and patron they seek a place for themselves in that remarkable outpouring of african_american art during the 1920s and 30
some constrain by social expectation efface the record of their work
others make it difficult for historian to treat them with much seriousness
what after all can we do with someone like nancy cunard a british steamship heiress raise on a remote english estate who feel no shame in proclaim i speak as if i be a negro myself
miss_anne the dismissive collective name give to white woman make bit appearance in the literature of the era as a dilettante or imperious patron later she ' depict as a thrill seek slummer
always she lurk in the shadow of her male counterpart in scholarly study of the movement
but she be there encourage writer underwrite cultural institution support progressive political cause
and many lead harlem_renaissance figure include langston hughes alain locke and nella larsen have reason to be grateful to her
at_least for a while
like everything_else about miss_anne those relationship get complicated
in this remarkable work of historical recovery carla kaplan author of zora neale hurston a life in letters do well by a group of woman who get so_much wrong
she resurrect miss_anne as a cultural figure and explore the messy contradiction of her life move her from the periphery of a story about white patronage and boundary test interracial liaison to the center
with a focus_on six of the roughly 60 white woman active in the harlem_renaissance kaplan delineate miss_anne as a counterpart to the better know flapper or new woman of the roaring twenties
but this be really a collection of individual story a group biography that let the idiosyncrasy of the individual woman shine through
negrotarians as the writer and anthropologist zora neale hurston call harlem 's white patron be a diverse crew full of good intention startle blind_spot and astonishing self confidence
miss_anne in harlem give just pass attention to the era 's quiet patron like mary white ovington a founder of the n.a.a.c.p. or the philanthropist amy â­spingarn
kaplan 's eye be on the woman who raise more_complicated question_about racial self identity
so we meet cunard a self appoint expert on african-â­american life who organize and self publish a massive 855-page anthology negro an entirely documentary record of the race even_though she would make only brief trip to america and have never be to africa
and we encounter charlotte osgood mason an imperious anti semite and collector of african art who demand that her harlem protege call her godmother
it would be easy to dismiss such woman as high handed interloper
but kaplan urge us to take them seriously and to use their sometimes overwrought even outrageous expression of cross racial solidarity as a way to understand a broad set of question_about racial identity
the book be full of fresh discovery
â­kaplan learn that lillian wood author of the radical 1920s anti lynching novel let my people go be actually white not black as other scholar have imagine
she reveal that josephine cogdell schuyler the white daughter of a klan member and the wife of the african_american journalist george schuyler collaborate anonymously on much of her_husband 's work and use several pseudonym to write for his journal convey the false impression of a community of white woman who share her anti racist view
but the focus of the book remain squarely on the large issue of racial identity raise by miss_anne 's deep personal identification with african_american life
miss_anne want_to suggest_that race be a construct ideal yet she stumble over the internal contradiction of her impulse
she fight_against racial essentialism and the perverse logic of america_'s one drop rule which proclaim that even a trace of african heritage make one black but she also celebrate the seem vitality and distinctiveness of black culture
josephine cogdell schuyler write in her diary the night before her wedding to my mind the white race the anglo saxon especially be spiritually deplete
america must mate with the negro to save herself
in a similar expression of romantic racialism the philanthropist charlotte osgood mason laud the creative impulse throb in the african race
as kaplan suggest white man could sometimes get away with idea like this a dose of black culture offer a useful inoculation against the debilitating sterility of the industrial world
but white woman who seek an_intimate connection with african-â­american life be see as traitor to the race even sexual deviant 1_2 next_page

like most serious american novel about war the woman who lose her soul want_to explain the country in its entirety
of course that ' a tall order but bob shacochis do_not lack for ambition his novel be about not one but two contemporary war both of them endless the war on terror and the war on drug
it_' a novel about the united_states that take_place largely outside the united_states if_you discount the many scene set on various world renowned american golf_course
although the book strive to paint a full portrait of its panoply of complicated character both in warrior mode and on the home front the problem with endless war in a narrative be that the writer end_up not with war and peace but with war and
more war
one follow from battle to battle from firefight to firefight from political assassination to terror attack to revenge taking without resolution because the endless war can conceive of no resolution resolution which make a narrative complete be not part_of this story
the woman who lose her soul open in the chaotic corrupt landscape of haiti in the 1990 an unpredictable place more or less run as it still be in part by u.n. peacekeeper
this be a country shacochis know well he cover america_'s 1994 intervention and occupation and write about it in his intelligent nonfiction book the immaculate invasion which show real sensitivity and sympathy to soldier as_well as an understanding_of how haiti work and do_not work
those quality serve him again in the woman who lose her soul
as usual in western novel set there haiti provide shacochis with a torrid primitive dangerous backdrop for the shenanigan of white people

it turn_out she ' not just an ethnobotanist
she be also the daughter of the man_who for all intent and purpose run the world
this woman who lose her soul be a male fantasy an object of male regard and unlike the novel 's big male character she be see from within only while she ' a teenager and on a few other discrete occasion
you would imagine the novel could_not help founder on the shoal of this gilded pornographic creature yet the world shacochis present be believable enough and important enough to allow the book to sail on over the annoyance of the fantastical siren at its heart
i can_not reveal the strange contortion jackie go_through or the level of be and nothingness she experience without spoil some of the book 's many denouement
but suffice it to say that as you become more enmeshed in this paranoid and persuasive presentation of the world we live in jackie or dottie or renee become slowly more human less a goddess in spite of her almost mythic travail
in fact it_' a man 's world shacochis delineate and it_' probably fair that he turn his heroine into a man 's fantasy of what constitute female power
the world the book create be one of secret delta force mission of pakistani peacekeeper/drug dealer of mesmerizing vodou priest of croatian revenge seeker of spy and gook and wog shacochis 's character vocabulary and at its heart often at jackie 's side eville burnette a handsome straight shoot american soldier with perfect pecs and glute who come_out of the west from a horse-â­wrangl mom and hunter dad a fighter who be willing_to do what he ' assign even_if it do_not square with the america he have for so long feel in his vein especially when he polish his dad 's old gun or when he fish or when he venture into what ' leave of our pristine wilderness 1_2 next_page

the wrath of american justice affront as much by his defiance as by his crime await him if he ever return
it_' a story that have become grimy with symbolism about hollywood privilege 1970s california indulgence imperfect parenting judicial pandering and inconsistency torture creative temperament and the right of rape victim

it_' also an exercise that use autobiography as a feminist tactic for geimer to own her sexuality acknowledge her crummy but eventually better lifestyle choice in the year after the rape and cash in on her right to tell the story her way
polanski cash in on his in 1984 with his autobiography roman
the credit go to newman i be guess for establish the lively pugnacious narrative voice one that manage to sound simultaneously like a provocative kid geimer 's first impression of polanski ew there_' this guy who ' like my size and sort_of look_like a ferret and a wised up adult there come a time when you need to let it go unless you do_not want_to

lisa schwarzbaum a former critic at entertainment weekly be a freelance writer
julian barnes have disregard the conventional boundary between literary genre for as long as he ' be publish book
so it should come as no_surprise that levels of life a putative grief memoir about the loss of his_wife the literary agent pat kavanagh be part history part meditative essay and part fictionalized biography
the piece combine to form a fascinating discourse on love and sorrow
each of the three essay the sin of height on the level and the loss of depth begin with the same concept that of put_together two thing that have not be put_together before
in the first essay the 19th_century photographer and inventor gaspard felix tournachon later know simply as nadar combine photography and aeronautics as the first aerial photographer
in the second essay barnes narrate an imaginary affair between the actress sarah bernhardt and fred burnaby an english traveler and adventurer
in the third essay love unite barnes and his_wife and persist even after kavanagh 's death
a series of coincidence link the three essay
burnaby and bernhardt also ride in balloon nadar photograph bernhardt several_time nadar be a devoted husband despite his many affair and he nurse his_wife in her last illness as barnes nurse his
element from the book 's first two section reappear as metaphor in the third you feel absurd like one of those dress mannequin surround_by skull that nadar photograph in the catacombs
or like that boa constrictor belong_to bernhardt which take to swallow sofa cushion and have to be shoot dead
but the fact of barnes 's life_without kavanagh do_not need metaphor
i look_at my key ring which use to be hers it hold only two key one to the front_door of the house and one to the back gate of the cemetery he write
i use to rub oil into her back because her skin dry easily now i rub oil into the dry oak of her grave marker
kavanagh do_not appear until the last of the three essay
she cast a shadow over the playful and digressive preliminary chapter and in this new low light they seem a defense against grief 's identity warp madness as if barnes worry_that write about the death of the beloved may kill her all over again this time in prose
the third essay bracingly precise be the emotional center of the book
barnes here be simultaneously wise funny and devastating when you change your make of car you suddenly notice how_many other car of the same sort there be on the road
they register in a way they never do before
when you be widowed you suddenly notice all the widow and widower come towards you
when he see his congolese postman move to a new route for the first_time after kavanagh 's death and must explain that she be go he observe i be think even as i be speak now i be have to do it all again in french
during a late_night cab ride home barnes 's driver ask your wife be asleep will she
after a silent choke i give the only reply i could find
i hope so memoir be often accuse of be the most indulgent literary genre and the first two essay intellectually and imaginatively rigorous provide a kind_of apology for the third
but despite all expectation those two be the one that occasionally wax sentimental the dialogue between burnaby and bernhardt can blush somewhat purple
in the third essay barnes refer_to the dangerous lure of grief 's self pity isolationism world scorn an egotistical exceptionalism all aspect_of vanity
his articulation of his anguish be well serve by his leeriness as the book 's last section be one of the least indulgent account of mourn i have ever read
i almost wish
levels of life consist only of its 56 shattering page

his third at the bottom of everything be far_more sophisticated
dolnick have retain his strength his sensitive gauge for emotional state and his empathy but his writing be more taut more piquant not only observant but wry in its depiction of human fallibility
the result be a lively often funny book about be young and smart and confused fumble through life in a middle_class american sort_of way
there be tragedy here too but it be dress in such ordinary clothes that it feel less like tragedy as we be used to it in art and more like the heartbreak we know from experience the kind that come from have the misfortune to care about other people

what he do be work as a tutor which seem along_with be a nanny to be one of the loophole people my age have discover in the professional world
in the context of his professional and romantic misstep adam start to take on a blandly sympathetic everyman quality but the book regain its footing once its focus return to the pells
it turn_out adam and thomas share a secret something they do that have horrific consequence for another person
at the bottom of everything be essentially a book about guilt specifically the kind that result from a small mistake whose reverberation be disproportionately large
this secret prove after a while to be too_much for adam and thomas 's friendship

greg tobin have write several book about the american west include the novel prairie
virtually everything worthwhile write about american poverty be essentially about moral failure
it be the failure of the society accord_to liberal or of the poor themselves accord_to conservative or of institution and individual together in a complex combination accord_to centrist
poverty violate core american value
it challenge the american dream 's promise of prosperity for anyone_who work hard a faith central to the national ethic
richard wright call this faith the truth of the power of the wish
the dream die in the early page of sasha abramsky 's intricate study the american way of poverty
abramsky a freelance journalist who have write for the nation the atlantic and other publication regard inequality as a social control mechanism support by financial interest belief in the desirability of oligarchy
he endorse the notion popular on the left that poverty be not just a glitch but a feature of the american system a corrosive brew he write capable of eat away at the underpinnings of democratic life itself
his observant reporting be less doctrinaire than these grand assertion
he travel the united_states meet the poor whose wrench tale he insert in tight vignette among data drive analysis and acute dissection of government program
the country he portray be damage by indifference at high_level his american hero be not in congress or boardroom but be rescue here and there by care citizen at the grass root their inventive program achieve small success
abramsky present himself as an heir to michael harrington whose book the other america publish in 1962 awaken part_of the political establishment to the shadow of poverty beneath the country_'s gleam affluence
but that work come during the civil_right movement which be already sensitize americans to social injustice
fifty one year_later injustice do_not readily incite outrage
this be so even as million of middle_class americans in free fall during the economic collapse that begin around 2008 have have a taste of what it mean to be poor
the absence of a strong movement for change be striking especially give the diversity abramsky find as he map the landscape of poverty
there be people with no high_school education who be poor he write but there be also university graduate on food bank line
there be people_who be poor because_they have make bad choice get addicted to drug burn bridge with friend and family and then there be people_who have never take a drug in their life who have huge social network and who still can_not make end meet
the destitute include those_who have never hold down a job and others who hold down multiple but always low-â­pay job frequently for some of the most powerful corporation on_earth
there be the chronically poor child whose only hot meal be what they be give at school and the newly poor who have lose the middle_class comfort of huge suburban house and expensive car
many of these people 's wound be intimate and invisible to outsider

a hawaii woman name emily could never free herself from the legacy of a family rack by alcoholism and violence
what should we do abramsky ask with someone like emily
his answer be not to blame the victim and he skewer conservative for do so
whether poverty be cause_by dysfunction or the dysfunction be itself a product of the poverty or as be likely the dysfunction and the poverty interact in ever more complex feedback loop for the large community to wash its hand of the problem represent an extraordinary failure of the moral imagination

no open house no advertising and not a single online photo
and yet a $ 27 million town_house on the upper_east side and an $ 850,000 two_bedroom co_op in lower_manhattan have no problem find buyer in the past six_month
neither home be list on the open market
off market deal know as whisper listing have long be the purview of the ultra high end market
certain property often with price tag of $_20 million or more be shop with a shroud of mystery among a small circle of well connect agent instead of be put on the market for the world to see
now this hush hush approach have spread to many price point include apartment below $_1 million as seller realize the advantage they have thanks to the lack of apartment available for sale in manhattan
seller feel cocky
seller feel_like they have the ball say brian k. lewis an associate broker at halstead property who in the last six_month have take on seven whisper listing from client who do_not want_to list their apartment but be willing_to entertain offer
these range_from a two_bedroom for $ 1.295 million on the upper west_side to a downtown loft for $_12 million
in an improve economy with no inventory they have the asset people want
the number of apartment for sale in manhattan at the end of august be at its low_level in at_least 13 year accord_to miller samuel the appraisal firm
the shortage have force real_estate agent to use aggressive tactic to drum up inventory from troll through expired listing in the hope of revive a dead deal to send letter to owner in choice building to try_to persuade them to sell
no_one know_how many property be sell through a well place word but off market tactic appear to be on the rise in major market where there be a scarcity of inventory include san_francisco los_angeles and miami
there_' more of it now than ever before say shaun osher the chief_executive of the brokerage_firm core in new_york note he have a database of about 50 apartment own by people willing_to sell give the right circumstance
we as broker know everything be always for sale at a price
plenty_of circumstance arise in which it make_sense to keep a list out of the limelight range_from celebrity who do_not want_to read about their property transaction in the tabloid to seller who would rather not upset tenant prematurely
some seller hope to avoid the hassle involve in get a property in shape to show
others do_not want a_lot of people traipse through
in march for_example a five bedroom town_house at 12 east 76th street on the upper_east side sell for $ 27 million in a whisper sale without_any wear and tear to the carpet
the place trade after just three viewing
yet most brokerage_firm be of two mind about off market deal
on the buy side they be largely for it
after all quietly gain access_to an off market listing mean less competition in a market where open house often provoke a stampede
uncover a whisper sale by say chat up the doorman for a client unable_to find something on the open market ultimately benefit that buyer
on the sell side brokerage_firm tend_to discourage whisper listing
for one the secretive nature of whisper listing mean some broker will inevitably be shut out of a possible deal
moreover seller hop for a quick full price sale through a whisper listing they say limit the buyer pool and thus their chance of get the high possible price
the seller be always go to be best serve by make_sure the property be expose to the wide possible marketplace say frederick peters the president of warburg realty
in_addition a whisper campaign can be a tall order
it_' sort_of like say achieve this great price and do all of this but do_not tell anybody about it say hall f. willkie the president of brown harris stevens
finally if discretion do_not move the merchandise broker can end_up do a_lot of work for nothing
in a whisper campaign the broker frequently have no sign contract with the seller a scenario commonly refer_to as a pocket listing

demography may as they say be destiny
but demography be anything but a sure thing
the united_nations population division say this_summer that fertility rate in many develop_country have not slow as the u.n. have expect
as a result it revise its forecast of the world population in 2100 upward by 700 million_people to 10.9 billion
two_year earlier the u.n. have make an even large revision raise the forecast from 9 billion
and in its 2008 forecast global population be set to peak around 2070 and then begin to fall
in the late forecast there be no peak in sight
what_we have be find when we have look_at all of the data say barney cohen the chief of the u.n. 's population study branch be that our previous projection be a little too optimistic
fertility in africa be not come down as rapidly as we think it would
africa account for nearly all the increase forecast for 2100 about 600 million and latin america account for 100_million more
the u.n. forecast for europe and north america be reduce from previous one
but it be possible that the u.n. 's late forecast be too pessimistic
an analysis of population trend by sanjeev sanyal the global strategist for deutsche_bank conclude_that population growth be likely_to be much slow than the u.n. 's estimate
in our view global fertility will fall to the replacement rate in less_than 15 year mr._sanyal write
population may keep grow for a few more decade from rise longevity but reproductively speak our specie will no_longer be expand
he forecast that world population will peak in around 2055 at 8.7 billion and decline to 8 billion by the end of the century
the fertility replacement rate the number of child per woman need to keep the population level over time be usually consider to be 2.1
mr._sanyal say that in the develop world it be high because of high infant mortality and maternal death in childbirth
for the world as a whole he think the current replacement rate be about 2.27 a figure that will come down gradually over time
the spread between the late u.n. forecast and deutsche_bank 's for 2100 2.8 billion people be great than the entire population of the world in 1955
developed country have long have low birthrate but the large decline in fertility be in develop_country with the chinese russians koreans and brazilians no_longer reproduce themselves mr._sanyal write
even_if mr._sanyal turn_out to be right some develop_country seem likely_to face explosive growth
in nigeria mr._sanyal say the fertility rate the number of child bear to an average woman during her life be about six more_than four time than the rate in japan
he think that rate will come down more rapidly than the u.n. expect but still forecast that the country will have 521 million_people by the end of the century an increase from about 160 million in_2010
the u.n. forecast be 914 million
the accompanying chart show the two forecast for nine major country
they agree in many way
by the end of the century both forecast see population fall in china india germany japan russia and brazil
the bank think there will also be decline in the united_states and france by then while the u.n. forecast have both country continue to grow albeit at decline rate
both forecast expect the british population to have level off
there be of course no way to be sure what will happen
a major epidemic could throw all forecast off
some develop_country have start campaign to raise fertility with only limited success so_far
but a world with fall population in many country and with the number of people of work age decline even more rapidly could lead to major change
retirement be likely_to occur later and it be at_least conceivable that some country will even compete for immigrant
many country be begin to welcome skilled immigrant mr._sanyal say in an_interview add that germany be increasingly open to those whose skill be not as high
mr._sanyal be skeptical about one widespread forecast that demand for health_care will expand rapidly as population grow
he say many of the old people be likely_to be healthy and note_that with few child there will be less demand for health_care from the young

new_york if_you do_not belong_to a community these_day you_'re really on your_own
but never fear
community have become one of those word that should always have quotation mark around it
word get hijack all the time but this be one of those really violent eight country stop for refueling hijacking
actual community in which people know each_other do thing for each_other and act in concert may be on the decline
but new meaning of community be rush to fill the void
in u.s. government speak there_' the intelligence community which every crisis reveal to be not much of a community at all
there_' a scientific community but they quarrel over citation like toddler
there_' the european community you_know how that ' go
in silicon valley there be a developer community of headphone wear techie who speak to no_one and play video_game alone
there_' a business community whose member seek to put each_other out of business
entire race be call community however gap their internal division
the religious who always seem to be emerge_from or head into a schism belong_to the monolithic faith community
these new us of community be about more_than semantics
they offer clue to our present day culture
they bespeak a world less tether to place than before uncomfortable with top down leadership even_if still dependent on it saturate by business logic but determine to disguise the tawdriness of selling obsess with networking and also embarrassed by it
go_back a century or two thanks to the corpus of historical american english database and you see rather different usage of community
the word then seem to connote a specific group of people from a particular patch of earth who know and judge and keep an eye on one another who share habit and history and memory and could at time be persuade to act as a whole on behalf of a part
people write of the community of my native city and the extensive community of swallow barn and the community of friends in barbadoes the lattermost refer_to quakers
the citizen of natchez be not a play go community jonathon holt ingraham write in a travelogue through the american south in 1835
philip rochester stand well in the community natalie sumner lincoln write in a 1920 novel
a bad man be a plague spot in a community professor kenyon l. butterfield write in a 1919 work on the future of farming
in case where community be mean more abstractly it be often in reference to the political community in a democracy a group not know to each_other but bind together in a solemn and real way
the republican principle demand that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affair alexander hamilton write in federalist no 71 in 1788
fast forward to today and in some arena this style of usage persists
but it compete now with a great many community that be not really community at all
what they be though be culturally tell
place and share experience have fall away_from the modern understanding_of community
when people speak of the medical community or the venture capital community they_'re really describe people with common interest and not common value history or memory
community in this sense be less about have one another ' back more about lobby for the same thing
it_' also about networking and deal making under the cover of a word that make such endeavor sound less crass
almost_every conference these_day tell its attendee that it_' not really a conference but a community

here be excerpt from their conversation
q.
so how do you land the role of the mother
a. you_know it be a very roundabout way
there be not really audition for it
there be like meeting
i meet with the show 's creator craig thomas and carter bays over skype and i do_not know_what it be for
and then people start come to see once
it be so secretive that i be like o.k. i_think i know_what this be about
i read that neil patrick harris mistakenly congratulate you on the role while you be still test
have you meet him at the tonys
maybe we meet but i do_not think we do because you rehearse all morning then you go to your matinee then you do hair and makeup then you do the red_carpet then you sit for four hour
and you never really have a meal
i imagine it_' like get marry or something
people be hand you tequila shot and champagne
suffice it to say i do_not remember much of the evening
the mother be a bass player in a band
and in once you play the piano and sing
how would you come to have an arsenal of instrument
for once i learn the piano essentially
for this i be attempt_to learn bass
i mean do_not ask_me to play in front of anyone anytime soon
and i have always sing way longer than i have act
i just like could_not get a musical to save my_life
then you land once
i actually play a different role at a workshop in the beginning and the only instrument i play be the stick
john tiffany the show 's director really push for me to play this other role
we have a shorthand that be very special to me
we also can stay up and watch beyonce video all night
she ' my bomb
do beyonce ever see the show
one night i come_out of my dressing_room and there be secret service guy everywhere
and i get so excited
oh_my god beyonce be finally here
and then it be joe biden which be awesome and he be so lovely
but beyonce never come
you_know who do come and i lose my mind
liza minnelli and i just die
she come_out afterward and be like oh_my god your energy
i go completely silent
and now you have get a role in a scorsese film
it_' a very fun role and i be unrecognizable
i have a huge perm acrylic tip i be spray tanned and have a thick queens accent
it_' a big role
or at_least i_think it be
i constantly live in fear that i will show up to see it and they will have replace me with don cheadle
the set inside the cavernous studio on chelsea piers in manhattan be mean to represent the bunkerlike headquarters of a polished chinese techno gangster who have a relationship_with the criminal mastermind raymond reddington now for murky reason unknown to both the gangster and the audience align with the f.b.i. reddington the main character in the come and much anticipate new nbc drama the blacklist be at this moment wear a light green short sleeved shirt and brown walk short
he look more like a u.p.s. delivery man than the scourge of american law_enforcement
then again it_' only rehearsal and james spader have his reddington intensity dial down to zero in favor of his normal real life mode of free associate bonhomie
that be the quality that come through in his enthusiasm_for this new star role
the possibility of this show be limitless he say excitement pitch in his voice
anybody can be on the blacklist
ha ha ha anybody
no new network drama enter the season with high expectation or more pressure than the blacklist
the show have win wide praise from critic and be the most talk_about show during the last development season in hollywood
and to be blunt nbc need a hit
the network have slot it in the best spot on its schedule mondays at 10_p.m. after its top rat show
the voice
a_lot be rid on this series and mr._spader 's eye catch performance
a few_minute after rehearsal in a gray herringbone suit and vest hair skim close to his scalp mr._spader be in full reddington mode joust with his chinese nemesis with weary disdain deliver line of complicated dialogue with precision through 12 long take
one reason for all the repetition mr._spader 's new co star megan boone who play reddington 's foil in the series a young f.b.i._agent name liz keen be not as sure foot in the scene
of course ms. boone perhaps best_know for the short live law order los_angeles have not be act in movie television and theater for 35_year as mr._spader have
would you say spader be kind_of an enigma ms. boone muse later in her dressing_room
he ' very unexpected
he ' very kind and considerate
but then you also do_not ever feel 100_percent comfortable
all of which make james spader the ideal choice for reddington a character intend_to fascinate and mystify
in the opening episode to be show on_monday night reddington give himself up to the f.b.i. offer to help capture a host of known and unknown supercriminals on just one condition that he work with liz keen a woman
he seemingly have have no prior connection to
even mr._spader do_not want_to know too_much about the reason for all that
as long as the show continue to be enigmatic it have its compulsion mr._spader say
i need to know a little_bit more_than the viewer but i do_not want_to know more_than that
jon bokenkamp one of the executive_producer of the blacklist say that in conversation with another producer john fox they picture a keyser soze the mysterious villain of the film the usual suspects
mr. bokenkamp point_out that reddington tell the f.b.i. do_n't trust me
everything about me be a lie
the script for the blacklist be mr._spader say intrigue in way that get his attention
it be to be shoot in new_york he note which he consider home
and then there be that character
there be he say his eye widen with delight a_lot of room for me to move around in there
mr._spader have always be an actor who look to expand boundary
his career have range_from memorable teenager pretty in pink to provocative bad boy sex lie and videotape to acclaim television lawyer
he win three emmy_awards for play the character alan shore in two series the practice and boston legal
along the way he acquire a reputation for quirky idiosyncratic performance of eccentric character
now 53 and no_longer in possession of the wavy lock that be his early signature mr._spader remain in demand for more mature quirky idiosyncratic performance
come off
boston legal mr._spader be at loose end and break he say because he spend all his television money on new household family new life and all that
movie hold little appeal either in role or compensation
then david mamet approach him about his play race slat for a broadway run
mr._spader say yes not a perfect play but a great role for me

the next generation of a prominent new_york real_estate family business glenwood management have take up the mantle at the company and begin its first condominium project
glenwood be one of the city 's large private landlord and have a long history of building and manage rental apartment but howard and steven swarzman the grandson of leonard litwin the founder of glenwood make the decision to take on the condo project at 60 east 86thâ street
this come about because my brother steven and i_want to try this model as oppose to what_we have develop in the past say howard swarzman acknowledge_that his grandfather have a philosophy of build high quality rental housing
but what_we 're most concerned with be build the same quality housing we have always do he say whether it be for sale or rental
along_with the swarzmans mr. litwin be a sponsor of the project as be several glenwood executive
while other manhattan property developer have be flock to the ultra high end condo market where apartment have recently go into contract for as much as $ 90 million apiece mr. swarzman say that be not a motivating factor for the glenwood team
the project call sixty east eighty sixth a 19-story building that will be build just east of madison_avenue with 15 full floor three- or four bedroom unit will be price at about_$ 7 million to $_20 million an apartment accord_to beth fisher a senior manage_director of the corcoran sunshine marketing group which will be market the unit
the glenwood team mr. swarzman say have begin demolition of two exist building on east 86th a 30-foot wide town_house and an adjacent walk up building both buy in march for a total of roughly $ 31 million
the condo tower should be complete by the spring of 2015 he_add
a small building site and manhattan 's exorbitant land price make it impossible to do the sort_of rental building with dozen of unit that glenwood typically construct even with rent at record level mr. swarzman say
sixty east eighty sixth will only be about 60,000 square_foot he say rental building be typically around 300,000 square_foot
clothe in fluted limestone with casement window and juliet balcony sixty east eighty sixth be be design by a collaboration of the steven b. jacobs group a previous glenwood partner and the danish architect thomas juul hansen a richard meier protegee who design the interior for pricey manhattan project like the perry street residence and one57 a tower under_construction on west 57thâ street
besides the 12 single floor unit the project will have three marquee residence a duplex penthouse with a rooftop and side terrace a 10th floor duplex with two terrace and a ground floor triplex with a 36-foot by-30-foot rear garden
price will range_from $_12 million to $_20 million
the building 's amenities will be on the basement level include a fitness room individual storage room a bicycle storage room a child 's playroom and a wine cellar
the lobby will have a sitting area a small library and a 24-hour doorman
mr. juul hansen who tend_to favor classic material clean line and minimal furnishing say his goal at 60 east 86thâ street be bridge the contemporary with the traditional
obviously this be not downtown and it_' not the high line or any_other neighborhood that ' sort_of up and come he say
there_' a history here so what_we have try_to do be create a building that on the one hand be very modern clean and simple
but on the other_hand be very respectful of the neighborhood and environment
elevator will open into the full floor unit arrive_at a foyer that separate a private wing with bedroom and bathroom from the public room
the live room and dining_area will be open and spacious with ceiling height of about 10 foot or nearly 20 foot in the duplex and the triplex
floor will be wide plank oak except in the kitchen where they will be vals quartzite
mr. juul hansen say that while the building will have large window the structure will be a far cry from a contemporary glass tower
we have beautiful window but they_'re not just flat piece of glass he say
they have true divide pane that will add texture to the facade
only step away_from central_park the large residence be design to have broad appeal ms. fisher say but may attract family in particular perhaps those already live on the upper_east side but look for new construction
ms. fisher say she could_not yet reveal exact pricing for the apartment but add i_think the market throughout the city have come to accept that $ 3,000 per square_foot be a baseline number for a luxury condominium on the market
certainly on the upper_east side right near central_park

the crab cake have be bake the corn on the cob boil the spinach steam the cocktail stir
still no sign of ms._stritch
the minute tick by with a small frisson of anxiety building
the dinner 's host kim and henry hagood who have become ms._stritch 's friend since she move next_door can_not seem to get a response either to a phone_call or a knock on the door
we all know she ' not be well lately
then with little fanfare there she be a beam smile on her face a bark command to her caretaker on her lip
she be dress with her usual ahem minimalism in black tights a detroit athletic club t_shirt and not much else
except for one new and unhappy accessory a wheelchair
ms._stritch would doubtless prefer a mod string of pearl but the last several_month have not be kind
before make her dramatic exit from new_york to theater lover for whom ms._stritch be an ornery goddess it be as if the chrysler building itself have pick_up its skirt and skip off to detroit of all preposterous place ms._stritch take a bad fall one morning while leave her longtime habitat the carlyle hotel

not long after that ms._stritch take a second tumble break a hip
recovery be under_way and ms._stritch be settle down in birmingham when she lean over to brush her teeth one night at the bathroom sink somehow lose her balance and hit the deck again fracture her pelvis

when ask what she ' be do to keep herself occupy the answer come quickly sleep often until 3 or 4 in the afternoon late even by the standard of showbiz folk
but she seem to relish this i_'ve be prepare_for this nap for a long time she_say
black humor have always come naturally to ms._stritch whose long career on the new_york and london stage and more recently on the television series 30 rock have make her a well armored survivor
ask how she have be adjust to her new life away_from the spotlight ms._stritch say i do_not really know i have be too busy fall down
it_' like a comedy she add only a not so funny one
shortly_after arrive in birmingham ms._stritch give an_interview to the vanity fair web_site in which she seem grousy and regretful
grousing have always come naturally to this scaldingly frank woman but she ' never make much of a song and dance about woulda coulda shoulda
i_'m think maybe i leave a little early grumble the woman once notorious for be the last to abandon any party
the god apparently can_not take a joke because for now at_least even stroll next_door be out of the picture for ms._stritch
and yet perhaps because she ' be force to settle down her attitude toward her sudden bolt from the spotlight seem to be mellow
one thing i be proud of myself for do be combat those feeling she_say when those profess second thought be mention
i do_not want_to be a sad sack who make a mistake
i gotta have a home a base a place_where all my shoe be
i be settle

when it come to ratatouille there be no shortage of recipe
there_' the traditional time consume kind in which you saute all the vegetable separately then stew them together slowly in a casserole
there_' the shortcut method of simmer everything at once
there_' roast ratatouille microwave ratatouille and even steamed ratatouille though that one do_not tempt me at all
finally there_' grill ratatouille a recipe with many charm both in the method and the result
grilling take the whole process outside allow you to enjoy the last handful_of temperate night
the grill also add a lovely smoky nuance to the finished dish without overpower the essential flavor of vegetable olive_oil and herb
and grill ratatouille be relatively fast to make maybe not as quick as use the microwave but tasty
all of this say grill vegetable for a ratatouille do take some finesse
the first_time i try i do everything wrong
i build a very hot very high fire coat the pepper zucchini and eggplant in olive_oil then plop them onto the grill only to watch my poor vegetable blaze up and burn
so the next time i take thing more slowly
i build a less intense fire and spread out the coal more evenly
i leave off the oil at_least while the vegetable cook
then i hang around them sip wine and keep an eye on their various state of doneness pull_off each piece as soon as it be char in spot and very tender
no_one want al dente ratatouille
once everything be thoroughly cook and slightly cool i chop up the vegetable and douse them in olive_oil which be as essential to good ratatouille as the eggplant and pepper
i also stir in copious amount_of basil and garlic
what i get be something less stew y and more salad like than a typical ratatouille but with a concentrated flavor and velvety texture along_with a garlicky kick
i serve it with herbed goat cheese and crisp toast while it be still warm then eat the cold leftover the next day with a dollop of yogurt and a sprinkle of chile powder
like the original it will keep for many day in the fridge get better as it sit
grill ratatouille may not replace the other ratatouille variation in your repertory
but it_' a nice deeply flavored addition to the list

yet for most people the question of whether to expose unethical or illegal activity at work do_not make headline or involve state secret
but that do_not make the problem less of a quandary
the question of when to remain quiet and when to speak out and how to do it can be extraordinarily difficult no_matter what the situation
and while many think of ethic violation as confine to obviously illegal act like financial fraud or safety violation the line often can be much blurrier and therefore more_difficult to navigate
accord_to the ethics resource center a nonprofit research organization the no 1 misconduct observe by a third of 4,800 respondent be misuse of company time
that be closely follow by abusive behavior and lie to employee
the finding be publish in the organization 's 2011 national business ethics survey which interview on the phone or online employee in the commercial sector who be employ at_least 20 hour a week
it have be conduct biannually since 1994
but offensive behavior that create a hostile work environment although often not think of as unethical behavior be the lead reason people leave their job say patricia j. harned president of the center
abusive and intimidating behavior by supervisor and manager create a toxic work environment
so do lie to employee
lester who ask that i use only his first name to avoid possible legal issue work at a global consulting company for about three_year earn high performance rating
at one point he say he accidentally learn that his manager have deliberately lie to deny him a promotion opportunity
lester speak to the hiring manager to no avail and because the company have a strong ethic program include a specific no retaliation policy and a hot line to report ethic complaint he report the situation
an investigation find no wrongdoing and although lester appeal the finding no action be take against the manager
that be when he say the retaliation begin
all my direct report be take away_from me and i be give the most difficult project with the least resource he say
a whole series of thing happen which be unlikely to be a coincidence
after about eight month of this he decide to leave
lester 's experience may be the reason the misconduct most often see be not the one most often report
accord_to the ethics resources center report which be sponsor_by major corporation like wal mart and northrop grumman less_than half of those_who observe a bos lie to employee report it
on the other_hand while only 12 percent say they have witness someone steal from the company almost 70_percent of those_who saw such activity report it
one of the difficulty in case like lester 's be that no law have be break
true whistle blow accord_to stephen m. kohn a lawyer and executive_director of the national whistleblowers center be when people report see or experience something at their company that be against the law rather_than case in which employee feel mistreat but nothing illegal have occur
it appear however that an increase number of employee be willing_to come forward in both type_of case
more people be use their company ethic procedure to report misconduct and more people be file whistle_blower claim
mr. kohn whose organization refer potential whistle_blower to lawyer say there have be a 30_percent increase in the number of people request referral over the last 18_month which come to about 1,500 request a year
he also say the quality of complaint with more documentation and from high_level employee have increase
some of this be because of legislation rewarding whistle_blower for come forth and protect them against retaliation
the most_prominent of those be the dodd frank act which pass in_2010
under that act the securities and exchange commission oversee the office of the whistleblower which in 2012 alone receive 3,001 tip 1_2

as the securities and exchange commission 's chief of enforcement from 2001 to 2005 the era of landmark fraud settlement with enron worldcom and tyco stephen m. cutler earn a reputation as a tough and at time fear regulator
he be particularly dismay by chief_executive chief_financial officer general_counsel and compliance official who even_if not directly implicate in wrongdoing create a culture in which it be ignore tolerate or even bad tacitly encourage
in a speech in 2004 to the general_counsel roundtable he say you 've_get to talk the talk and you have get to walk the walk
both be critical to maintain a good tone at the top
and he call for more accountability hold all of your manager accountable for set the right tone
that mean discipline or even fire them when they have fail to create a culture of compliance
human nature be what it be there will be those_who break the rule
but if manager do_not do enough to prevent those violation or let_them go unaddressed for too long then they should be hold responsible even in the absence of direct involvement in those violation
how time have change
as general_counsel of jpmorgan chase company mr._cutler be now on the receive end of the lecture which this_week come from george s. canellos a successor to mr._cutler and currently the co chief of enforcement at the s.e.c. on_thursday the s.e.c. and other regulator announce that jpmorgan have agree to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly $_1 billion in fine for its conduct in the london_whale matter in which the bank 's chief investment office lose more_than $ 6 billion and bank official mislead regulator about the loss
the s.e.c. fault jpmorgan 's egregious breakdown in control and say that senior management break a cardinal rule of corporate management by fail to alert the board to the full extent of the problem
the s.e.c. do_not name any of those senior manager but make reference to the chief_executive who be jamie dimon
mr._cutler oversee both the legal and compliance department during those event
mr._cutler no_longer oversee compliance
and the london_whale affair be not jpmorgan 's only regulatory problem
the bank face multiple other regulatory action and investigation range_from manipulate energy market to mortgage_back security fraud to fail to disclose suspicion about the ponzi scheme operator bernard madoff to conspire to fix rate in the setting of the global benchmark interest_rate informally know as libor
as the allegation have mushroom jpmorgan have go with almost dizzying speed from one of the world 's most admire bank to one taint by scandal
and all of this happen on mr._cutler 's watch
you have to say he do_not run a tight enough ship say john c. coffee jr. a professor of law and expert in corporate governance at_columbia university
it_' not just the london_whale episode
i would not call that the crime of the century
but take with everything_else the energy manipulation the mortgage fraud case the libor rigging it suggest_that there be not enough investment in compliance and the general_counsel be not proactive enough
he ' do a very_good job at defend the firm but not enough at prevent it in the first place
a lawyer whose company be an s.e.c. target during mr._cutler 's_tenure say this_week i have to admit to a certain amount_of schadenfreude add at the time he do a_lot of grandstanding about lawyer be gatekeeper and the moral compass for the organization and how we_should have prevent all this
he sound great on the soapbox
now i have be follow jpmorgan and it_' pretty ironic
this lawyer be among the many i contact who do_not want_to be name
i quickly realize_that i be waste my time try_to get people to offer unconflicted comment about mr._cutler or anyone_else at the bank since a their firm represent jpmorgan b they represent someone for whom jpmorgan be pay the legal bill or c they_'re try_to get into category a or b. james cramer joke on cnbc 's mad money this_week that jpmorgan should just buy the manhattan law_firm paul weiss rifkind wharton garrison famed for its high stake litigation practice 1_2 next_page

to be more precise the executive whose success be build on leather bag and shoe tap the designer alessandra facchinetti to make clothes for tod 's well design streamline tailor with a compass and ruler present a more realistic vision of clothes for summer 2014 than some of the pretty floral design that be hit the runway
i believe_that we can build the clothing part_of our tod 's business to 30_percent over the next five_year say mr. della valle as the model in their modernist but wearable clothes stand on a podium at the show 's end
ms. facchinetti who formerly design at gucci and at valentino present a precise chic collection in which she take no risk unless you count a geometric circle dress inspire_by the artist and architect of italian modernism
she cite gio ponti and lucio fontana as among her inspiration
but as befits a house build on skin the designer also use perforated leather for skirt that seem as polished and streamline as her chestnut red/brown lead color
these be clothes for real life with the white shirt part_of the equation and a sense that the shoe flat or with a high heel and the bag sometimes fold into the hand really have grow as a new branch from tod 's root
that be already an achievement
and the element of craft put into apparently simple clothes as_well as the modesty of the approach and the presentation suggest_that this could be a fruitful collaboration
nature and especially the flower be as ever the motif of summer dressing
the importance for designer be to find a way to modernize florals to take the flower from pretty to punchy or to change its shape from tidy botanical drawing to digitally explode pattern
it_' about color and asiatic country and gray sky and different proportion say giorgio armani backstage before his emporio armani show where everything begin with watery flower that even ripple over hose to give an all over effect
the designer call his use of color and shape as poise between realism and abstraction by which he mean there be a harmonious unity about the decoration not the current shock of over sized or dramatically digitalized print
one important change apart_from model walk_out with hairdresser clip on their head be the silkiness of fabric use for pant that be mostly soft and often crop above the ankle or ballooning into a soft fullness
intriguingly there be only one long ankle length skirt yet it look_like one of the best proportion piece in a collection that show emporio armani 's soft side
it_' the chaos theory say antonio marras refer_to the word of ovid in the poem metamorphoses a book he have backstage along_with the whimsical artwork of flora and fauna by the american painter kathy ruttenberg
but nature do_not seem in any way chaotic in the marras collection
with violinist play in a green dell beside the improvised runway the first ensemble seem the essence of calm a black mesh sporty dress that when the model turn show another aspect equally light organza with a flower pattern billow across the back
this mix be a modernize aspect_of the collection that introduce into the grove of tree not only predictable if beautiful print of flower but also element of plastic
they give a jolt of modernity to the romance that be always part_of the marras aesthetic
and the blend of tailor jacket with soft skirt the dawn color and the occasional olympian vista of a pastoral landscape make for a fine collection
there be time when veronica etro seem to sink into her family 's fabric business others when she try_to fight it
her show friday have a certain serenity as if she have decide that graphic florals and the company 's perennial paisley print be just right for her idea of fluid summer clothes
with just a touch of the hippy 1970 in scarf frame with fringe at the neckline and languid liquid long dress that look quite beautiful ms. etro do what be require of her make the brand look credible
there may have be more focus_on a different approach to paisley and florals although there be a sudden foray into appliqued flower in hot pink
but mostly the print be just well control dress slender and wrap into shape tailor jacket in lightweight fabric to counter the more hippie look of flow skirt
altogether it be a pleasing collection for a house and a designer who be wedded to pattern and print

so_much for till death do us part
for the first_time more americans 50 and old be divorced than widowed and the number be grow as baby_boomer live long
sociologist call them gray divorcee
barbara wingate and her_husband of 34 year divorce in_2009 after the marriage of their daughter
both be 58 and they have try for a year to resolve their difference
i be in shock and seek counseling for several_month say ms. wingate who_live in toledo ohio
my whole identity be connect to him and his career
a half century ago only 2.8 percent of americans old than 50 be divorce
by 2000 11.8 percent be
in_2011 accord_to the census_bureau 's american community survey 15.4 percent be divorce and another 2.1 percent be separate
some 13.5 percent be widow
while divorce rate over all have stabilize and even inch downward the divorce rate among people 50 and old have double since 1990 accord_to an analysis of census_data by professor_at bowling green state_university in bowling green ohio
that ' especially significant because half the married population be old than 50.â
in 1990 1 in 10 person_who divorce be 50 or old
by 2011 accord_to the census 's american community survey more_than 28 percent more_than 1 in 4 who say they divorce in the previous 12_month be 50 or older.â researcher at bowling green warn_that the rise divorce rate among old americans have serious implication that go well beyond the couple themselves
like widowhood divorce can contribute to economic strain and poor health place a large burden on child and give shrink family size on institutional support from government and other source
it_' still true that in general the longer you be marry the low your chance of divorce but it_' sure no guarantee anymore say stephanie coontz who teach family history at evergreen state college in washington state
she attribute the trend to the high rate of divorce among baby_boomer and to the fact_that many be in second or third marriage make them statistically more prone to divorce
still she and others detect an increase in divorce among couple who have be married 25_year or more
i do_not necessarily think this will accelerate but i do_not expect it to go down she_say
stay together until death do us part be a big challenge than it use to be because we expect so_much more of marriage than we do in the past and we have so_many more option when a marriage do_not live up to those expectation the extension of the active healthy life span be a big part_of this professor coontz say
if_you be a healthy 65 you_can expect another pretty healthy 20_year
so with the kid go it seem more burdensome to stay in a bad relationship or even one that have grow stale
most divorce among old couple as in young one be initiate by woman
woman have long be more sensitive to or less tolerant of a mediocre relationship than man professor coontz say and so another big factor be that with their increase work experience and great sense of their_own possibility they be less willing_to just wait it out.'â we expect to find equality intimacy friendship fun and even passion right into what people use to see as the twilight years,'â she add
it take work
it_' not something you_can put on the back burner while you raise your kid for_example and think it wo_not scorch somewhere along the way professor coontz say
robert d. gould a new_york trial lawyer who handle matrimonial case and himself be divorce when he be over 50 say a_lot of marriage die a long time ago but because of the shame involve in a family people often stick together for the child

fen lin attribute the trend to several factor include societal acceptance of divorce and the increase economic autonomy of woman

the professor find that divorce be more_likely among old couple who have less education who be african_american or hispanic and who have be marry for few than 10_year
nonetheless they say that if the rate remain constant we project a 25_percent increase in the number of people that will experience divorce two_decade from now among americans 50 and old

i wait in the mouth of a tunnel beneath the concrete bleacher of nebraska 's memorial stadium
rock side to side on the sol of my shoe i focus_on the rhythm of my breathing and scan the stand watch them fill one red pixel at a time
a dream of mine be about to come true
i be about to take the field at a cornhuskers football game
it be a dream i conjure when i go to my first nebraska game as a preschooler rid on my_father 's shoulder
one i have hold on to since first grade when i earn the nickname husker boy for my daily crayon drawing of eric crouch bobby newcombe and correll buckhalter
one i have try_to visualize during a couple of week of practice that have prepare me for the performance but not the moment
instead of wear a red jersey and a white helmet the combination that make up many of my childhood halloween costume i wear overall and a jacket of wool and polyester wield a trombone in my right hand
i start play trombone in fifth grade the same year i last play organize football
that be the age i_realize i be not go to be the next tommie frazier even_though i wear his no
15
eight_year later i go to the university of nebraska draw there not only by an urge to stay close to home and the football team whose result control my mood swing but also by the chance to be in the march band which have long_ago supplant play_football among my_favorite pastime
my first game as a member of the band in_2010 be also taylor martinez 's first game as nebraska 's start quarterback
the announcement of his name in the starting lineup have the stadium buzz a half_hour before kickoff
but sway anxiously under the bleacher i be more_concerned with get through my first pregame performance mistake free
as kickoff loom ever closer i repeat my sequence of drill move in my head imagine step by step my route around the field
we have learn the routine a few_week earlier in band camp a week of 14-hour day spend practice music and march on a field mold by the footprint of mike rozier and ahman green
during camp and two week of morning rehearsal after school start we spend as much time in memorial stadium as the football team would all season
and now it be showtime
when i strut onto the field for the pregame show i eye my mark on the turf and the time keeping of our conductor and try not to be overwhelm by the density of the red clad crowd surround us
later that become a difficult task
as we play the final chord of the star spangled banner i hear the roar of jet engine pass above the flyover our director have explicitly tell_us not to look_at so that our eye would remain on the drum major who would promptly lead us into the next phase of the performance
but i_realize quickly that the noise be not above me but around me
i have mistake the rumble of the crowd 's applause for the sound of plane fly overhead
i_realize just how loud 85,000 people could be and it hit me that after 18 year of observe college football from 40 row up in the stadium i be now part_of the spectacle on the field
in the first quarter martinez score on his first carry a 46-yard scamper that set the tone in the huskers 49 10 victory against western kentucky
while the fan in the stadium express their glee with incoherent yelling and awkward high five we in the band have only a second or two to celebrate
then we begin play our fight song hail varsity and
there be no place like nebraska lead to the crowd 's excitedly off tempo clapping and chanting of go huskers during the brief pause in the music
they be ritual i have become accustomed to as a spectator but the change in perspective make it all a new experience
as the game continue i learn the rule that guide the band 's action
â
no sit in the bleacher when the team be on the field
â
no play music if there be a penalty flag or an injury
â
no daydreaming once a play end our focus must shift to the drum major whose hand signal tell_us what to play
go be my day of idle observe of watch nebraska beat pittsburgh on a block field goal in 2005 or celebrate the huskers 300th consecutive sell_out game in_2009 or root for comeback that fall_short against texas in 2002 and virginia tech in 2008
the trombone become my free ticket into every game but it also make me an active participant in the game day ritual
after the game the band assemble on the field and march through a tunnel up a ramp and out of the stadium dance to drum cadence back to the campus 's music building
we pass child sit on their parent shoulder girl sport temporary tattoo of red n 's on their cheek boy wear red jersey
at that moment they may have be dream of become the next taylor martinez

but what if despite their apparent similarity sadness in the realm of artistic appreciation be not the same thing as sadness in everyday life
in a study publish this_summer in the journal frontiers in psychology my colleague and i explore the idea that musical emotion encompass both the feel emotion that the music induce in the listener and the perceive emotion that the listener judge the music to express
by isolate these two overlap set of emotion and observe how they relate to each_other we hop to gain a better understanding_of sad_music
forty four people serve_as participant in our experiment
we ask them to listen_to one of three musical excerpt of approximately 30 second each
the excerpt be from mikhail glinka 's la separation f minor felix blumenfeld 's sur mer g minor and enrique granados 's allegro de concierto c sharp major though the excerpt be in g major which we transpose to g minor
we be interested_in the minor key because it be canonically associate_with sad_music and we steer clear of well_know composition to avoid interference from any personal memory relate to the piece
our participant be more or less split between man and woman as_well as between musician and nonmusicians though these division turn_out to be immaterial to our finding
a participant would listen_to an excerpt and then answer a question_about his feel emotion how do you feel when listen_to this music
then he would listen_to a happy version_of the excerpt i.e. transpose into the major key and answer the same question
next he would listen_to the excerpt again in both sad and happy version each time answer a question_about other listener that be design to elicit perceived emotion how would normal people feel when listen_to this music
this be a slight simplification in the actual study the order in which the participant answer_question about felt and perceive emotion and listen_to sad and happy excerpt vary from participant to participant
our participant answer each question by rat 62 emotion relate descriptive word and phrase from happy to sad from bouncy to solemn from heroic to wistful on a scale from 0 not at all to 4 very_much
we find as anticipate that feel emotion do_not correspond exactly to perceive emotion
although the sad_music be both perceive and feel as tragic e.g. gloomy meditative and miserable the listener do_not actually feel the tragic emotion as much as they perceive it
likewise when listen_to sad_music the listener feel more romantic emotion e.g. fascinated dear and in love and blithe emotion e.g. merry animated and feel_like dance than they perceive
something similar happen with the happy music perceive blithe emotion be rat high than their felt counterpart
in general it appear that perceive emotion may be rat high than feel emotion when it come to emotional category characteristically associate_with a give key
when listen_to sad_music then there be a tension or slippage between the two type_of emotion
how be we to understand this gap
one answer may be that in everyday life we typically experience emotion that have a direct connection to whatever object or situation give rise to them
but when we listen_to sad_music or watch a sad movie or read a sad novel we be inoculate from any real threat or danger that the music or movie or novel represent
if this be true what_we experience when we listen_to sad_music may be think of as vicarious emotion
here there be no object or situation that induce emotion directly as in regular life
instead the vicarious emotion be free from the essential unpleasantness of their genuine counterpart while still draw force from the similarity between the two
we_need to study vicarious emotion further
in do so we may be_able to improve our understanding_of a neglect feature of our emotional system namely its sensitivity to something other than palpable need or threat
when we weep at the beauty of sad_music we experience a profound aspect_of our emotional self that may contain insight about the meaning and significance of artistic experience and also about ourselves as human being

islamabad pakistan the pakistani government say friday that it would release a senior taliban commander on_saturday to facilitate peace_talk in neighbor afghanistan

new_york tough new limit on the amount_of heat trap emission new power_plant can emit will likely accelerate a shift away_from coal fire_power and toward electricity generate with natural_ga wind and sunshine
power price for home business and factory may eventually rise and nuclear_power could return to fashion
the rule propose by the obama_administration friday will have little effect on the mix of power source and electricity price anytime soon because it only apply to new power_plant and be likely_to be challenge in court
even so market force be already reshape power market in the same_way the rule will
a boom in natural_ga production in the u.s. have dramatically increase supply send price plummet and prompt a shift away_from coal
the rule require new coal_plant to be build with extremely expensive equipment to reduce carbon_dioxide emission
that will make coal look prohibitively expensive to regulator and utility plan for the future
by comparison natural_ga fire plant which emit half as much carbon_dioxide as coal_plant along_with wind turbine and solar panel will look_like a bargain
jason bordoff director of columbia_university 's center on global energy policy call the rule consistent_with already evolve market trend toward the use of natural_ga instead of coal and describe it as cost effective
nonetheless it create financial winner and loser
here ' how the landscape could change for company and customer
winners natural_ga
most new natural_ga fire_power plant will stay within the rule 's emission limit without require new equipment
that mean natural_ga fire plant already by far the cheap power_plant to build and operate will likely remain the top choice for utility
as utility rely more on natural_ga to generate electricity demand for the fuel will increase and price could rise
that would mean more revenue for domestic natural_ga drillers such as exxonmobil and chesapeake energy drilling service company such as halliburton and baker hughes and pipeline company such as spectra energy and kinder morgan
it will also help maker of natural_ga fire turbine such as general electric and siemens
renewable energy
wind and solar developer such as nextera energy and firstsolar may see increase demand for large project especially if power price rise
that would also help rooftop solar installers such as solar city attract more interest from home and business
nuclear_power
nuclear like coal have suffer from the low power price bring on by cheap natural_ga
utility have abandon ambitious plan to build new nuclear plant and they have shut_down age plant that have become too expensive to run
if price rise nuclear operator such as exelon and entergy will benefit
and because the new rule make new coal_plant so expensive utility afraid of rely too heavily on natural_ga for future power production may turn instead to nuclear
power generator
if electricity price rise as coal use decline company that sell wholesale electric_power such nrg energy and calpine may benefit
losers coal miner
the u.s. coal industry be already struggle because coal supply pile_up and price drop as natural_ga gain favor
u.s. production be expect to fall to a 20-year low this_year and 151 mine that employ 2,658 worker be idle in the first_half of this_year accord_to snl energy
while coal will_continue to be an_important fuel for electricity generation in the u.s. for decade it appear to be face a long slow decline
the country will get less and less coal from the comparatively high cost appalachian region and more from cheap to access coal deposit in the illinois basin and in wyoming
company with large appalachian operation such as james river coal and alpha natural resources will likely continue to suffer
electric customer
natural_ga price generally dictate the price of all electricity in the u.s.
if demand for natural_ga rise fast than drillers supply it the price will rise and drag power price up too possibly boost electric bill for home and business
in the past natural_ga price have be extraordinarily volatile
industrial company who have use low power price in the u.s. as a competitive advantage be concern
the national_association of manufacturers say in a statement friday that the rule will hurt competitiveness and job creation

when you_can drive a car off the lot with that new car smell for a mere $ 199- or $ 299-a month lease many consumer can_not help ask how can i afford not to take this deal
after all if your family be already pay for cable television and a couple of cellphone many of the current lease be offer may_seem like a relative steal
and with lease fuel surprisingly strong car sale it seem that more driver be think in those term
indeed the pay as you go smartphone mentality seem to have seep into the car market especially with young buyer many of whom do_not seem to mind that they do_not own anything at the end of the lease 's term
but that have not change the long_term economics of leasing it still cost several thousand dollar more_than buy a new car not to mention a newish use car
people 's attitude be shift say philip reed senior consumer advice editor at edmunds.com
the car be be see more as a commodity to be use and then return
ownership be a big part_of the world_war ii generation people want_to own their house and own their car
they be teach that be financially responsible
there be reason certain people may want_to lease the first one be you have extra money to burn
but for the rest of us the financial consequence be worth re examining especially when you have a slew of compete financial priority like college tuition retirement or even a nice vacation
so let_'s start with the hard number
mr. reed look_at three way you could acquire a four door honda accord ex buy a new 2014 model lease the same 2014 car or buy a used 2011 accord with 36,000 mile
many_people in the new_york area be pay about_$ 28,211 for the new car include tax title and registration
the analysis look_at the cost over six_year since the average person own a car for that long and it incorporate typical buying pattern the new accord be purchase with a five_year loan the use car be finance with a four_year loan and the person_who be lease must take out two consecutive 36-month lease
the rest of the assumption be detail on the accompanying chart
lease initially seem to be the cheap route when you look_at total out of pocket expense it cost_$ 5,244 less_than buy new
buy a used car be still the most economical
you save $ 5,277 compare_with leasing and it_' about a whopping $ 10,500 less_than buy new
but when you account for the teensy fact_that you do_not own anything at the end of those six_year the calculus change
if_you have buy the car new it would still be worth about_$ 11,000 accord_to edmunds.com 's calculator
the used accord would be worth around $ 5,000
so after you factor in that equity leasing cost_$ 5,756 more_than buy a new car and $ 10,277 more_than buy use
buy new cost_$ 4,521 more_than buy use
leasing be the loser across the board
if_you ask_me what be the most expensive way to get a car the answer would be you only want_to own it during its period of great depreciation and then move to another new vehicle say jeff bartlett deputy automotive editor at consumer reports
well that ' what leasing be
with that analysis in mind here be some other factor that need to be consider when decide the best way to acquire a car
needs versus want be there anything you absolutely need now that you_can not get in a lightly use car that ' only a few_year old
some expert say you_can make a decent argument for new car base_on some recent safety improvement
the insurance institute for highway safety which some expert say tend_to have more rigorous guideline than the government add new recommendation after its late small frontal crash test last summer
and some manufacturer have be update their exist model mr. bartlett say to meet those standard
though it_' hard to argue_that anyone need to have the late technology that have come a long_way in the last couple of year too
that two- to three_year time difference mean the world in term of connectivity mr. bartlett add
now there be stereo in mainstream car that offer pandora aha and stitcher for stream internet radio via a smartphone and allow you to control an ipod
plus usb connection be fast replace traditional microplugs and bluetooth be near ubiquitous
the expectation of mobile connectivity and what you_can do on the run have change dramatically
leasing
it become a difficult cycle to escape
unless you save extra money while leasing you may not have accumulate enough for a down payment on your next car and you wo_not have a car to trade in
and now that you_'re accustomed to the low monthly_payment it will be hard to stomach the much high monthly cost of buy new or even a not too old used car in some case
you will avoid repair or maintenance cost except for oil change and tire rotation that use and even new car buyer would eventually have to pay
but you will_probably pay more for insurance with a lease vehicle which mr. reed say be almost as much as the extra maintenance
it end_up be close to a wash
leasing also allow you to get into a car right away with little financial disruption it require little or no money down and minimal outlay each month
there_' also the fact_that you_'re drive a brand new car with all of the late technological and safety feature
time horizon
beyond the number your time horizon should also help determine what you ultimately decide
if_you be someone_who know they be go to own a car for 10_year and you be drive all over the country you be not the type_of person_who should be leasing say alec gutierrez a senior market analyst of automotive insight at kelley blue book refer_to the mileage limit of about 12,000 a year on lease vehicle
if_you go beyond that you be likely_to be hit with significant penalty
besides buy a new car and hold_onto it be more economical now
you be make pretty high payment for about four or five_year but the dependability of car be really great these_day say mr. reed
it can probably go another five_year with minimal cost
lease mechanics
you_'re essentially pay for the amount_of value the car lose over the course of your lease in other_word the price you pay be base_on the vehicle 's residual value at the end of the term
consider a $ 30,000 car that be worth $ 15,000 after three_year
you will divide that into monthly_payment and that be your lease payment plus interest and some fee mr. reed explain
you also only pay sale tax on the amount_of the vehicle that you use in this case $ 15,000
that '_why car that retain their value tend_to translate_into better deal for leasing the high the residual value the low the monthly_payment
thing like mercedes bmw and honda hold their value very well and make very_good lease car mr. reed say
if_you do lease figure_out the number of mile you_want to drive each year how long a lease you_want and how_much you_want to put down
then call a few different dealer and ask them to quote you a monthly_payment
this be the simple way to shop around mr. reed say though leasing aficionado may choose to get more technical
buying used
if_you buy used you may need to come_up with a large down payment than if_you buy new since more people tend_to default on used car you may have to put 10 to 20_percent down on a used car compare_with 0 to 10_percent for a new one
but because of the easily repossessed nature of the collateral if there be one loan that be easy to qualify_for it tend_to be a car loan say greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate.com
pay cash
of course there_' always the option of pay for a car the old_fashioned way save up and pay cash
that ' what mr. bartlett of consumer reports do whether he be buy new or use
obviously nobody do this he say
but when you pay cash you do_not have to worry_about them sneak in all of these fee
you just negotiate a price and then write a check for that number
if i can put some of it on my credit_card and then get the point and pay it off at the end of the month i come_out ahead
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september 25 2013a chart on_saturday with the your money column about the cost of lease versus buy a car misstate the percentage of the purchase price of a $ 28,211 car that be represent by a down payment of $ 5,112
it be 18 percent not 20_percent
ottawa at their peak just a few_year ago blackberry smartphones be symbol of corporate and political power
when president_obama take office he make keep his blackberry a personal priority and when blackberry service have a hiccup so do business on wall_street
but after be upstaged time and again by industry rival the device may soon remain only in memory
on_friday blackberry announce that it would lay off 4,500 employee or nearly 40_percent of its already reduce work force
the cut be so deep some analyst and investor say that the company 's day as a smartphone maker be effectively over
the company also say that it expect to report a quarterly loss of nearly $_1 billion next_week mainly the result of a write off of unsold blackberry phone but also because of payment to stop manufacturer and supplier from add to the pile
and of its six phone that the company offer two will be discontinue
this be a recognition that they lose the handset war say james h. gellert the chairman and chief_executive of rapid ratings an investment risk evaluation firm
it_' certainly a waving of the big white towel
the company halt the trading of its share to make the bleak announcement
it also say that revenue be expect to have be $ 1.6 billion in the second_quarter almost half of the $ 3 billion analyst have anticipate
sale of phone during that time it say total 3.7 million
apple by comparison sell 31.2 million iphones during its last quarter
more alarming to many_analyst be blackberry 's announcement that it have use about_$ 500 million in cash to stay operating during the last quarter lower its cash holding to $ 2.6 billion
although the company have be lose market share for several year it have manage to increase its cash holding
share in the company tumble 17 percent for the day to $ 8.73 nearly all of it after trading be resume
four_year ago blackberry have 51 percent of the north american smartphone market accord_to the research firm gartner
but the fast change industry and in particular phone from apple and samsung leave the company behind
the rest of the smartphone world be race ahead at top speed while we have blackberry stuttering to a stop say michael gikas the senior editor for electronics at consumer reports
blackberry 's executive initially look down on the move to make smartphones into pocket size computer which be pioneer by apple 's iphone
but consumer prefer smartphones with full touch screen multiple camera and most_important hundred_of thousand_of apps
blackberry 's device largely stay the same often with half screen and a physical keyboard and its initial attempt at touch screen phone be technological failure
in_january the company introduce the blackberry 10 line of phone which be base around an entirely new operating system of the same name and offer hardware feature that be similar to device from the market leader
but the new device be unable_to break the grip of apple and samsung
when the late flagship phone in the line the z30 be announce this_week it cause hardly a ripple
even blackberry seem to have give_up
unlike with other phone in the series the z30 release come without_any kind_of public or flashy demonstration
the failure of the blackberry 10 line of phone quickly lead to speculation that the company like palm before it would be break apart and perhaps gradually disappear at best linger as little more_than a brand name
this_summer blackberry announce that it be undertake its second strategic review in less_than a year
unlike with the earlier one however blackberry 's executive do_not rule out a sale of the company
all of the uncertainty surround the company several analyst_say probably make the company 's problem even worse during the last quarter
corporate and government information technology department have hold back on commit to blackberry 10 phone and more important for blackberry the corporate server software that support them
consumer be often less sensitive to corporate problem
but keith lam a manage partner at red sky capital management in toronto say that carrier appear to be cut back their blackberry 10 inventory to avoid be saddle with unwanted phone and reduce display space and promotion for the device in store
from that it kind_of snowball downward for blackberry say mr. lam whose firm do_not manage any blackberry share
if as many expect blackberry be no_longer in the handset business the question become what remain of value to a potential investor
mike lazaridis the co founder of blackberry who step_down as co chief_executive in_2011 have contact private equity firm about a possible bid for the troubled company
but a private company would be up against some of the large company in the world like apple
even before friday many_analyst have declare blackberry 's hardware business to be worthless
there be no clear consensus however on the value of its other asset
blackberry own a secure global network that once provide it with a selling point for customer seek security
but that highly centralized network be prone to occasional failure be base_on age technology and have have its role reduce under blackberry 10
the value of the company 's patent many of which it hold in partnership with other technology company be also uncertain
the layoff also suggest_that blackberry will be force to give_up most of its research and development work further cloud its value
the big problem be that they wo_not have money for r.&d. and that ' death for a tech company say neeraj monga an analyst at veritas investment research in toronto
it_' not like coca cola which have be_able to bottle the same formula for over 100 year
i be walking along a twilit hudson river the other night distract by how gob of blacken chewing gum can make a sidewalk look leopard spot when an even more vivid sight catch my eye
i_saw a flutter of excitement ripple through a row of 15 or so people sit on park bench along the water
the flutter be like a seat nonstadium version_of the wave and lead to isolate pocket of chitter and simulation of postcoital languor
have a squirrel 's tail just tickle a long row of human bottom
what just happen i ask a park bench sitter in her 20
she report hugh jackman just walk by
sans sunglass or hat
i express enthusiasm and ask_if she have wave or say hello
she tell_me no
i be cool
which be how we all try_to be in the presence of the famous no
but sometimes we_'re unwilling or unable_to curb our less instinct we_want to parse or mediate an entity that be at once wholly familiar but wholly unknown to us we_want to touch the proverbial screen
be this bad manner
we_'re tell as child do_n't stare but every celebrity seem to wear a placard around his neck that scream please do
one day about 11 year_ago the personal trainer and entrepreneur diã¨ry prudent be sit in the air_france lounge at charles de gaulle airport with his 3-year old_daughter when cicely tyson enter
i tell myself do_n't stare,'â mr. prudent say
miss tyson make no eye contact but after a few_minute of watch my_daughter play patty cake with daddums she crack a smile
i know that smile
i have see sound and the autobiography of miss jane pittman
i cry every time
mr. prudent lean toward miss tyson and whisper excuse me but be you cicely tyson
miss tyson give mr. prudent a gaze that could sear beef
then she respond with a question why
before i could even think of what to say out it come why not?'â cough cough
cricket
a german shepherd chain to a fence plaintively bark
fortunately miss tyson chuckle
i blush and we both quickly go_back to mind our business mr. prudent say
incident in which a nonfamous person have ground for interact_with a famous person can also be fraught
matthew tynan an associate at the law_firm pelosi wolf effron spates recount how a dinner_party in the early 90 hold by his_mother kathleen tynan a writer who have be marry to the critic kenneth tynan draw the director jonathan miller the actor dirk bogarde and princess margaret
matthew tynan say p. m. clearly enjoy slum it with her intellectual friend but i imagine that the trip down our rusty stair past the dustbin to our basement flat be a new low
press into service as coat check bus boy and waiter the teenage mr. tynan be remind by his_mother to bow to the princess and call her ma'am
at one point i find_myself serve a fish course to p. m. and as i lower the dish in front of her she abruptly raise her hand arrest mine mid motion
all conversation immediately stop
without look up she bark wrong side!'â as everyone watch i make a muffled apology pick_up her poached salmon raise it over her head resist the urge to deposit it there and gently sit it down on the right side
mortified mr. tynan slink back to the kitchen
but when it come time to clear the fish course i notice with smug satisfaction that p. m. have not use the correct knife and i could_not resist mumble something pathetic along the line of be there a problem with the fish knife ma'am
if she hear me she make no sign of it and completely ignore my presence a skill that she have surely hone after many year of interact_with the servant class
it_' probably not worthwhile to generalize as to how famous people want us to behave around them
while certain comment commonly and unmaliciously direct at the illustrious be often construe by their audience as hurtful e.g. i_'ve be a fan of yours since i be a tiny child
i_think i just read something of yours!"- many other comment fall under the gauzy heading depend_on situation
tom waits may or may not be amuse to be tell that his voice be indistinguishable from cookie monster 's the singer and actress connie stevens may or may not want_to know that you and your facebook friend larkily refer_to asterisk as emoticonnies
but maybe not
the desire when in the presence of the famous to separate yourself from the herd by say something memorable to them be a dangerous one
as someone_who once tell tina fey i have a big gay crush on you i can attest that the anxiety about a celebrity 's response to a provocative comment be not worth the ground gain by utter same provocative comment
that say miss fey seem flattered

for the second year in a row new_york city_ballet have ally with high fashion for its fall gala
last time the costume design be by valentino and the review of the event mostly describe it as an artistic fiasco or insignificant
i miss it
by those standard this recent program at the david h. koch theater on_thursday be a vast improvement
only one part_of the evening be apt to give you bad dream
in between a john adams orchestral fanfare and the finale of balanchine 's western symphony come three world premiere each with a different pairing of choreographer and fashion_designer
before each piece a video peek at the collaborative process
such video often feel superfluous or pandering but these be charming find good humor in the conflict between fashion and choreography
marc happel the director of city_ballet 's costume shop come off as a hero a man you would want by your side in the artistic trench
first be capricious maneuver by justin peck the city_ballet soloist who have emerge in the last two_year as its most exciting choreographer
the costume by prabal gurung be respectful for the three woman short dress in white black and red that move well and add color and flair
the work set to lukas foss 's capriccio be only eight minute long but it pack in plenty
this be mr._peck 's fourth piece for the company and though the influence of other choreographer be patent you would not mistake his work for anyone_else 's capricious maneuver be a tightly construct garment nothing capricious about it and yet it breathe freely
the title of the adams orchestral fanfare
short ride in a fast machine could have apply to it
two man join the three woman and mr._peck shuffle two against three with great dexterity
the dancer be pattern maker but they be also young_people draw together in fellowship
it_' characteristic of mr._peck that the woman be happily slide under the onstage piano and characteristic that that motif be vary to comically surprising effect
he pull a thrilling recklessness out of his cast
andrew veyette 's abandon have rarely seem so dashing
brittany pollack in a breakout performance justify her red dress
next come neverwhere by benjamin millepied the former city_ballet principal recently name the director of the paris opera ballet
the costume by iris van herpen be more attention grab make of scale of black plastic that sparkle in the light
the woman 's point shoe be also boot a novel and provocative crossing of two kind_of female footwear with different association of power
though crinkly the costume work fine and mr._millepied 's dance for three couple attend closely to its score drones and viola by his frequent collaborator nico muhly
though both the music and the dance be break into section silence meet with blackout it_' in fluency that choreographer and composer be well match
particularly in a late tender duet for sterling hyltin and tyler angle the endless thread typical of mr._millepied 's partnering float on mr. muhly 's drone
between the costume and the pyramid cut out of the backdrop and the dancer gathering into inward face circle neverwhere be something of an alien rite
but its sci fi sheen do_not make it ridiculous especially not in comparison with the evening 's final premiere
spectral evidence by the veteran french choreographer angelin preljocaj have two source of inspiration the salem witch trial and recording of vocal music by john cage
olivier theyskens have costume the piece 's four man in dark suit and clerical collar
the four woman wear white dress each with a different patch of red silicon
the patch be distract one resemble a baboon 's buttock and not as meaningful as scarlet letter in a work where all the woman be witch
the action begin promisingly enough with man of the cloth seat on slab
the four witch materialize from behind cover the man 's eye and manipulate the man 's body
amar ramasar and robert fairchild do a severe puritanical dance to liturgical sound chant
then mr. fairchild precise and forceful throughout smite the air with a two handed karate chop
the slab break into ramp and the work start to go downhill
mr. preljocaj 's choreography for these witch who just want_to be love and these hypocritical man_who find them tempting but sinful have some drive and snap
tiler peck as usual make the most of it
but as the work continue it come to resemble a supernatural creature that just wo_not die
the lapse in taste get bad and bad and the literal reduction of the breath noise and sound effect in the cage composition hit a nadir with poor mr. fairchild 's acting possess while lip syncing
it_' strange no the record voice he mouth ask in french
yes and not in a good sense
at best city_ballet have acquire a halloween dance
too bad the fall season run only until oct._13
that still give you five more chance to see spectral evidence
mr._peck 's and mr._millepied 's work which have more_than car crash appeal be not on the schedule
be poor planning to blame
fashion

silver as it_' know have recently become a road trip destination among_those willing_to drive for a good meal
but it_' no overnight sensation
alotta gelato 's mitchell hellman the man with the spoon celebrate the store 's 10-year anniversary last_month and a couple of other great restaurant have be around just as long
silver begin as a mining town in 1870 hippie come a century later and new artist have since arrive and add their_own flourish like candy color paint job on the stately cast_iron facade downtown
the food scene be an extension of this creativity and it prize local ingredient farmer_market tomato can sell_out in 35 minute as_well as excellent import one like mr. hellman 's cherry
this be not because it_' trendy but because silver city 's isolation the town back up against the 2.7-million acre gila national forest and it_' 45 mile to an interstate inspire chef to build their_own world
as a guidebook author i have be to silver several_time but be always too rush to savor the place

he tell_us how he would arrive in silver from the bay area a decade earlier
he would be look for a remnant of the new mexico he would know in santa fe after high_school in the early 1970s back when it be just cowboy and indians and hippie
mr. politte find a little of that rough around the edge atmosphere here
he relish introduce customer to new flavor fresh banana blossom say which he score from a grocer in tucson
or chapulines grasshopper bring to him by a customer from oaxaca
people say whoa that ' scary,'â he relate with glee and i say
no man it_' food.'â
the next day we walk the trail on boston hill in town start behind old cottage and wind up past the long abandon silver mine that give the city its name
in the wilderness at the top we rest on an incongruous turquoise blue bench
below us silver 's core look tidy and timeless
the town founder be determine to make a lasting place unlike other slapdash mining camp
so up rise grand limestone brick and cast_iron edifice
they weather the crash of the silver market two flash flood and the collapse of downtown commerce that beset so_many small american town

for many cyclist rid a bike be a kind_of heaven
you_'re simply a body breathe clean air and have very few thought
that ' the meditative side
it do_not hurt that the sport be kind to the knee
that ' the non load bearing exertive side
then there be the fan who like to mosey the leisurely bike rider
no spandex or clock speed for them
they do_not pay_attention to the mile
it_' just the wind in their face and the tranquillity and peace that they feel
with the advent of fall three writer tell_us about their favorite bike journey from a beloved route along roll field and lake champlain in vermont and upstate new_york to a ride in the wild green countryside of western ireland and a night ride in paris road closed
not to me
a road closed sign be always a gamble on a bike ride
ignore it and be reward with mile of tranquil car free riding
usually the road damage be passable on a bike
then there be the day when a dead end force a retreat and a detour
that be the choice we confront in the lush foothill of the adirondacks in new_york
the sign block a scenic alternative to mile of rid on the shoulder of state highway 22
beyond it a smooth dirt road pass beneath a ceiling of maple and hemlock branch that tint the summer light green
after a brief consultation with my_friend and rid partner sean luitjens we wheel around the sign
i hope we do_not regret this i say
even without this hiccup our trip around the midsection of lake champlain which separate vermont from new_york involve more logistical wizardry than usual
it would take three ferry ride to complete the seven hour 78-mile loop that begin at my house in the college town of burlington vt
we start the ride cycling south past suburban housing tract into hill carpet with hayfield punctuate by the occasional mcmansion and vermont clapboard farmhouse
a swoop down to lake champlain and across the wooden slat of an 1870s era cover bridge bring us to a ferry connect quaint charlotte vt
to the little lakefront town of essex n.y.
a few mile north of essex highway 22 kick up for three strenuous mile
as it flatten we come to highland road and that closed sign

jillian sanders frequently visit the facebook_page of a high_school classmate she have not talk to in year
but these drop in more like recon mission be not_entirely pleasant
i do_not know_why it infuriate me say ms. sanders 31 a freelance book publicist
she 'll often describe say how her favorite ice_cream flavor make her happy all day
i_feel like she ' lie
i get upset watch people post picture of a rainbow that say i believe in magic upset that they_'re project that image and think others be fall for it or that they_'re fall for it themselves
maybe i be just jealous
zeke farrow 38 can identify with the impulse
he sometimes virtually check in on a friend with whom he have an acrimonious falling out year_ago
i do_not know_why else i would go to his page except the hope that i will see something bad or narcissistic say mr. farrow a screenwriter base in los_angeles
i_want to see him prove his_own behavior because he can_not help it
so if_you 're already expect it before you go to their page it_' a joyous confirmation
the new_york author david goodwillie 41 spread out his joyous confirmation among a varied ensemble
there be more_than a dozen people i would and should block on facebook he say
but i be so astounded and enthralled by their constant posting that i stay friend with them just to see if_they 're_go to post for the 12th time this_week about their book or their baby
these individual be hate read much as you may be do right_now with this very article
hate reading usually of social_medium provide satisfaction from fury fuel engagement with someone_who should theoretically not provide it
our motif rarely come from a position of strength as katie j. m. baker a writer for jezebel describe in her exploration of hate read the internet
i usually hate read alone late at night when i be procrastinate drunk bored or all three she write
when i finally walk away_from my computer i_feel like i have just binge on a butter sogged bag of popcorn before the movie even start i be slightly nauseate but still can_not help lick my finger for more fatty flavor
ms. baker conclude her essay with a vow to go cold turkey as hate reading satisfies my negative energy but it leave me with little more_than a false sense of both security and productivity
or as she_say in an_interview after acknowledge she be not able_to swear off the habit completely the practice become way less satisfying after i_realize that i be hate reading to feel superior to other people
her self assessment may be a more enlightened version_of the finding from alexander h. jordan an adjunct assistant_professor of business administration at dartmouth
in a stanford study suggest we underestimate negative emotion in others life a misjudgment exacerbate by the cheery cast of most social_medium persona he and his co author write some research suggest_that downward emotional comparison can improve people 's well_being
it_' when a person 's typically rosy self view be temporarily threaten that self enhancement process such as find people to hate online be trigger professor jordan say in an_interview
research have also show that people_who be chronically unhappy or low in self esteem be more_concerned about social comparison upward or downward in general
so a common way to boost one 's ego through emotion regulation strategy he say be to look down on other people such as read a dumb blog to feel smarter or look_at photo to feel more stylish or a drama fill facebook_page that may make you feel you_'re well adjust
it_' not schadenfreude he note it_' more akin to gloat
bad these sad insecure people in other_word most of humanity at one time or another descend into unhealthy feedback loop he say
people look around at others perfect life on facebook feel bad about themselves boost their self regard by put out their_own perfect life and/or hate read others page and then their perfect life make others feel bad about their_own life in turn

but by the time the straehles lose the theater to bankruptcy in 2003 it have fall into disrepair

what be it about a bread and fry slice of meat that be so cross culturally endearing
call it a cutlet call it chicken fry steak
call it schnitzel or milanesa or cotoletta alla milanese everybody love it the world around
use beef veal or pork
or use chicken or turkey
it_' all good
the technique be always the same the meat be flatten by pound dip in flour and beat egg then coat in bread crumb and shallow fried until golden and crisp
there be abundant regional variation and i try_to sample them wherever i go
quality varies but if_you be a fan it be hard to find a truly bad version
the point be even a tough cut of meat when prepare in this fashion emerge_from the pan succulent and tender
i have have genuine delicate wiener schnitzel in vienna authentic big as a plate milanese cutlet in milan and the well love milanesa in argentina sometimes as a sandwich
i can_not resist even a so so truck stop rendition of chicken fry anything country gravy and all
i have a fondness for my israeli friend 's stellar chicken schnitzel roll in cornflake crumb
and a morsel or two of japanese tonkatsu in a panko crust be always nice
make this breaded marvel be easy at home
i cut thin slice from a pork loin and flatten them only a bit
rather_than fine dry crumb i prefer to make soft crumb from a day old french loaf cubed and whirl in a food processor which create a coating with a little texture
olive_oil be my choice for frying clarify butter or good lard be fine too
make_sure the oil be hot but not too hot and do_not skimp
you need more_than a film of oil in the pan to achieve the perfect color and crunch
season your cutlet both before and after fry it make a difference and serve them as soon as they be ready
i like to scatter a mixture of chop parsley lemon zest and caper over the top along_with a sprinkling of chop egg
but a wedge of lemon be all the garnish a well fry cutlet really need
do_not forget to administer a good squeeze of lemon juice just before dig in
washington a senior obama_administration official_say friday that the united_states be encourage by the initial inventory that the syrian_government have submit of its chemical_weapon arsenal
we be pleasantly surprise by the completeness of their declaration say the official who decline to be identify because he be not authorize to speak publicly on the matter
it be better_than expect he_add
the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the watchdog group know as the o.p.c.w. that oversee the international agreement ban poison_ga say on_friday that syria have provide an initial declaration of its chemical_weapon program
the submission meet the first deadline for syrian compliance that be set down by the framework_agreement that the united_states and russia conclude in geneva last_weekend
american british chinese french and russian diplomat be debate the term of a united_nations security_council resolution that would enforce the agreement
secretary of state_john kerry say on_thursday that it be essential for the council to adopt the resolution next_week
it start come in yesterday michael luhan a spokesman_for the o.p.c.w. say of the syrian declaration
mr. luhan who speak in a telephone_interview from the hague say that the organization 's technical expert be study the declaration but would not give additional detail
the declaration 's completeness be an early test of president_bashar al_assad 's commitment to relinquish syria_'s chemical_weapon arsenal
the united_states and russia agree in geneva that syria have about 1,000 ton of precursor chemical and chemical agent include sulfur mustard and sarin ga
the fact_that russia which have be one of the principal supporter of the assad_government reach a consensus with the united_states on the size of the arsenal after receive an intelligence briefing by american expert suggest_that the syrian_government would eventually declare a similar figure
still american_official have be wait to see if the syrian declaration would be submit within a week of the framework_agreement as the accord require and whether it would be comprehensive
under the framework_agreement the declaration be to detail type and quantity of all its chemical agent munition and precursor chemical as_well as all laboratory for develop the agent and facility for produce weapon
marie harf the deputy state_department spokeswoman would not characterize the syrian declaration say only that the united_states will make a careful and thorough review of the initial document
the o.p.c.w. do_not publicly disclose the content of declaration
but its assessment of the accuracy and thoroughness of syria_'s statement will be crucial in determine how inspector can best proceed with the agreement 's next stage which include far_more formidable test of the assad_government 's cooperation
by november international monitor be to inspect all of syria_'s declare site and equipment to produce and mix chemical_weapon be to be destroy
syria_'s entire arsenal be to be eliminate by the middle of 2014 although mr._assad have say that process could take a year
under the framework_agreement the united_states and russia be to outline procedure for quickly eliminate syria_'s chemical_weapon program and verify that the country be not hide any weapon or stock
an american and russian draft outline those procedure be subject to endorsement by the o.p.c.w. executive council follow by codification in the security_council resolution mandate elimination of syria_'s chemical_arsenal
the executive council be to have meet this_weekend but instead will likely convene toward the middle or end of next_week say mr. luhan who give no reason for the delay
the united_states have identify at_least 45 site associate_with syria_'s chemical_weapon program and have suggest_that half of them have exploitable quantity of chemical warfare material though american_official say syrian force have be move stock so the location could have change
american_official say the site where syria_'s chemical_weapon and stock be hold be control by mr._assad 's government
while russia have agree with the estimate of the size of syria_'s arsenal it have not endorse the american list of the site link to the syrian program

wolfeboro n.h. when it come time to update its popular odyssey minivan for 2014 honda opt not to make a clean sweep it just tidy up around the edge
exterior change to the fourth generation van be so subtle they practically fall into the if_you say so category and the body side retain a distinctive but polarizing character line that honda call the lightning bolt
while honda have add some convenience feature it devote much of its attention to improve crash safety
and in keep with the time it have raise the fuel efficiency a bit on some version
but the big attention grabber be an addition that honda claim to be an industry first and one it be heavily promote in its advertising and marketing of the new odyssey a build in vacuum cleaner intend_to appeal to parent of small child pet owner and the terminally sloppy
call the hondavac it be develop in conjunction with the shop vac corporation and be tuck_into the left bulkhead of the rear cargo area
its hose stretch barely to the farthest reach of the interior
i test the top of the line ex l touring elite which for $ 45,280 include the hondavac and just about everything_else short of the kitchen sink
the base lx model start at $ 29,655
my brother visit from ohio use the integrated vacuum to easily clean up dog hair
i stretch the hose to the front footwells to suck up some gravel track in from the driveway
alhough honda do_not completely re engineer the odyssey it make significant structural change to enhance front end crash protection
the odyssey use the second generation of honda 's a.c.e. body structure for advanced compatibility engineering which include high strength steel
honda credit this reinforced structure for help most of its new model get the top grade in the new more stringent small overlap crash test that the insurance institute for highway safety begin conduct last_year
the new odyssey score the high rating good because it also receive good rating in the institute 's other crash test it receive the high overall designation top safety pick+. no other minivan have yet be subject to the small offset test
in another effort to improve passenger safety honda change the design of the side curtain air bag so that they extend farther forward
the 2014 model be not include in a recall last_week of 318,000 odysseys from the 2003 4 model year as_well as 2003 acura mdxs for air bag that could deploy without warning
all model now have a rearview camera and trim level start with the midlevel ex l get forward collision and lane departure warning system
these provide visual and audible alert if sensor detect an impending crash or if the vehicle stray from its lane
honda have also include blind_spot monitor
the touring elite that i test flash warning on the housing of the side view mirror if a car be detect in the blind_spot
other trim level get the honda lanewatch that first appear on the accord it incorporate a tiny camera on the passenger side mirror that display a view down the van 's right side on the center dashboard screen
the engine be essentially the same as last_year 's a 3.5-liter v-6 that make 248 horsepower
but all version now come with a 6-speed automatic transmission
previously all but the top two trim line have 5 speed
the 2014 odyssey be rat 19 m.p.g
in the city and 28 on the highway up 1 m.p.g
in either drive mode over the old 5-speed
the odyssey continue to have a mileage advantage over its main competitor the toyota sienna rat 18/25 and the chrysler town country and dodge grand caravan 17/25
my best real world mileage in the 2014 odyssey be 26.7 m.p.g
on a 214-mile round trip with just one passenger
my bad be 21 m.p.g
on a 180-mile round trip from northern new_hampshire to this town on lake winnipesaukee with six people on board
over all the odyssey work well_as a family room on wheel
it be spacious and seat up to eight
even adult as tall at 6-foot-4 can sit comfortably in the third row without make passenger in the second row seat which slide forward and back for legroom adjustment suffer
the odyssey be reasonably quiet on most road surface for such a big boxy vehicle and the ride be comfortable
my one gripe continue to be the steering
head into a turn be a good time for steering to have some weight and feel
but that ' precisely when the odyssey 's steering feel seem to get light and give_up communicate anything to the driver
the navigation system have some quirk
if_you decide to deviate from the map route it do_not give_up and recalculate as quickly as some others do
and twice it tell_us that we have arrive several mile before our true destination one of which be a major hotel
in recent_year although the odyssey have not be the no 1 minivan in j._d. power 's initial quality or vehicle dependability study it have come in second to various competitor
accord_to alg a company that estimate the future value of lease vehicle the odyssey be likely_to retain more value after three_year than any_other minivan
even_though it have some minor flaw and the vacuum could be consider gimmicky honda be do something right
although the sienna have a more powerful engine and an all wheel drive option and the grand caravan be less expensive the odyssey have be outsell its competition this_year
with family continue their exodus to crossover from van lmc automotive say the minivan share of the vehicle market have slip to 3.4 percent this_year from 8.5 percent in 1995 honda be hop a gee whiz gimmick like the vacuum will generate some new customer
when family and friend visit q. if i allow close family and friend visit from abroad to stay with me in my apartment can a co_op board say i be sublet
a. it depend_on how closely relate you be to your guest and how long they stay
most proprietary lease permit an apartment to be occupy by the shareholder and the shareholder 's family say dennis h. greenstein a manhattan co_op and condominium lawyer
in many case he say family be define as a spouse child or stepchild and immediate family_member
if the close family the letter writer be refer_to be not permit by the proprietary lease they would not be allow to occupy the apartment
but mr. greenstein note_that proprietary lease generally permit overnight guest to stay in an apartment for up to 30 day provide the shareholder be also present
a friend will not qualify as a member of the letter writer 's family but would be consider a guest he say
mr. greenstein add that if any payment be be give to the letter writer by the family_member or friend the co_op board would most_likely consider the arrangement a sublet
he say that most lease give the board the right to grant or withhold consent to a sublet for any reason or for no reason and permit subletting may be subject to any condition the board impose
renew after a rent increase q. i do_not renew my lease when it be up for renewal because i_want to try and negotiate the propose rent increase
the landlord have not get back to me however after repeat effort to reach him
if i just sign the lease now to ensure they do_not try_to evict me do i have to pay the new rent start at the date my old lease expired which be also the effective date of the new lease or start the date on which i sign the new lease
a.
if the tenant sign and return the lease now he will be responsible_for the high rent go_back to the commencement date of the lease say samuel j. himmelstein a manhattan lawyer who_represent tenant
but mr. himmelstein say that because this appear to be a nonregulated tenancy unless the landlord have_already sign the lease the lease will not become effective until it be countersign by the landlord and return to the tenant
if the landlord have accept rent from the tenant subsequent to the termination of the last lease a month to month tenancy have be create he say
if that be the case and the landlord choose not to sign the lease he could start a holdover proceeding basically an eviction action against the tenant but only after serve the tenant with a 30-day termination notice
in that proceeding the court would have the discretion to give the tenant up to six_month to relocate condition upon payment of the market rent during that period mr. himmelstein say
wait for an offering plan q.
a good friend have an apartment under a market rate lease in a building that be become a condominium
the lease be in effect when the owner 's conversion plan be accept for filing by the state attorney_general 's_office
she have not receive a copy of the offering plan
her lease be up at the end of october and the owner be offer to allow her to stay as a month to month tenant
she would like to look_at the offering plan to determine whether she can_afford to buy her apartment
what right do she have
a. sandor krauss a manhattan co_op and condominium lawyer say that with noneviction plan conversion the most_common form of conversion state law give exist tenant certain right at the time that the conversion plan be accept for filing by the attorney_general 's_office
among_them the right to receive a copy of the offering plan the exclusive right to buy the apartment for 90 day the right to any insider discount and the right to decline the owner permission to show the apartment to potential buyer within the 90-day period
if a tenant do_not buy the apartment during the 90 day the sponsor must offer a new lease not a month to month lease at a market rate rent
mr. krauss say that if the sponsor have not comply_with those rule the tenant can file an action in the court or with the attorney_general 's_office require the owner to do so
the math averse may not be draw initially to proof the david auburn play that be be present by mccarter theater center in princeton
it be at_least superficially about advanced math and mathematician
but mr. auburn 's four character play which win the pulitzer_prize in 2001 be really more_concerned with the value of trust in relationship than with prove some mind boggle equation that change the world 's understanding_of the cosmos
and for all its emotional turmoil the piece be agreeably streak with humor
think of it rather as a nice geek in love sort_of scenario and the work become more invite
set on the back porch of a house near the university of chicago the contemporary story center on the 20-someth catherine unsettle by the death of her_father robert a celebrated mathematician who become helplessly bughouse as he put it in his late year
catherine relinquish her_own academic study in the field to care for robert and now obviously be at loose end
robert 's elder daughter claire who arrive from new_york for the funeral fear that the sadly withdraw catherine may have inherit her_father 's mental instability as_well as some of his genius and urge her_sister to return east with her for therapy
hal one of robert 's former student be a friendly stranger in the house who have be vainly sift through score of robert 's scribbled notebook to see whether the man conceive of anything significant during his lengthy illness
as the first act proceeds a romance be kindle between catherine and hal
their budding relationship break_down however when catherine show hal the content of a notebook she_say belong_to her
the disbelieving reaction of claire and especially hal shatter catherine 's frail composure
although the play 's eventual resolution may_seem somewhat facile what transpire before be a touching study in filial devotion as brilliant people struggle against their fear of madness
emily mann the mccarter 's artistic_director deliver a smart account of the play that look and sound wonderfully intimate within the center 's 360-seat berlind theater
ms. mann and her longtime collaborator eugene lee the set designer provide visual circumstance that seem equally natural and abstract
the chicago back porch be frame against a vast blackboard scrawl with equation theoretical notation and partial erasure in white chalk that suggest the enormous scale of robert 's calculation
it also provide the appropriate environs for a drama in which the figure of robert appear in the flesh during the flashback sequence but also as a presence in his daughter 's mind
persuasive act under ms. mann 's sensitive guidance lend the play a sense of warm actuality
often wrap in a too large cardigan that obviously belong_to her_father the insightful clothing design be by jennifer von mayrhauser catherine as portray by kristen bush be a spiky yet anxious individual
with her hair scrap back from a plain pretty face sometimes dominate by black rimmed glass ms. bush be believably either vibrant or desolate as catherine contend none too successfully with her violently fluctuate emotion
a craggy michael siberry resemble a white haired raymond massey at certain angle depict the kindly robert with expansive gesture and a resonant voice
thanks to the chemistry share by mr. siberry and ms. bush the scene in flashback between the father and his daughter be particularly poignant
perhaps the production 's most moving moment occur when robert seemingly lucid proudly show catherine his outline for a new proof
as catherine silently scan the notebook with robert beam at her side her eager face cloud and then fall when she realize_that her_father 's mind have begin to fail him again
dad she_say quietly let_'s go inside
ms. bush communicate a great deal of heartbreak in those few word
michael braun 's gentle scruffy hal be a lovable fellow who be clearly take with catherine 's mind and her other charm
jessica dickey give an assure performance as the bossy but well mean claire
stephen strawbridge the lighting designer artfully employ side lighting to give a sculptural quality to the actor
the complex sound design create by mark bennett musically percolate with woodwind and string as it punctuate the play 's mood most_notably with a sharp crack when catherine make a claim to greatness that conclude the first act so dramatically
proof by david auburn be at mccarter theater center 91 university place princeton through_oct. 6

runaway 18-wheeler death defy motorcyclist and vehicular acrobatics that seem to defy the law of physic have become a staple of youtube in large_part a result of the availability of dashboard video camera
it_' all entertaining but there be also practical reason for record while drive
the technology be readily available
personal action video recorder be already popular among outdoor sport enthusiast who attach camera like the gopro hero3 start around $_200 to their helmet
taxi fleet operator be use similar equipment to monitor their driver and to act as an eyewitness when collision occur
for consumer an inexpensive model design specifically for the family car be the genius dvr fhd590 about_$ 120 online
the dashcam be about the size of an oreo so it can be instal on top of the dashboard without block the driver 's view
it record full hd video have an led for low light situation and include usb and hdmi port for download and playback
it store file on a microsd card i instal an 8 gb card that cost_$ 13
compare_with point of view sport camcorder like the gopro model the genius be easy to set_up no squinting at endless menu require
it have a build in 2.3-inch color display so there_' no need to have a device like a smartphone to serve_as a viewfinder and it come with a power adapter windshield suction mount and a clip to attach it to a sun visor
once plug into a car 's 12-volt outlet the genius dvr fhd590 automatically begin record when the car be start and stop when the ignition be switch off
a build in sensor will initiate emergency recording in the event of an accident and the file remain store until the owner deliberately delete it
on several 200-mile excursion i find the record video clear enough at night to see the vehicle travel around me although on a dark street it be still difficult to pick out a driver enter her double parked car
scenic country drive and urban highway route be capture faithfully
the wide angle camera tend_to capture a more inclusive vista than what driver normally focus_on however on the interstate the camera 's recording of pass truck in narrow lane look more treacherous than it be in reality
while most driver be unlikely to record a hot lap around a racetrack or witness a meteor strike while on the road dashcams can be useful
i have be the victim of a hit and run by a new_york taxi which then run a red light to escape leave an ugly yellow streak down the side of my vehicle
the driver 's dangerous getaway mean i miss catch the license plate number
a dashcam like the genius may have save the day
once market for milady and available only for passenger vanity_mirror now come on both the left and right sunvisors of most vehicle sell in the united_states
among the 2,192 trim level offer on 2013-model car and truck dual visor mirror be standard on 81 percent accord_to chrome data solutions a portland ore. company that provide vehicle description for online shopping tool
but while many well appoint rams silverados and jeeps provide bilateral vanity_mirror 262 version_of new vehicle do_not
they have one visor mirror for the front seat passenger
that just seem crazy say david gartman a sociology professor_at the university of south alabama and author of auto opium a social history of american automobile design routledge 1994
it could just be dumb tradition
that ' where the vanity_mirror have always be because when couple ride together the man have traditionally do the driving
automaker may assume that since woman stereotypically be the vain sex they need the mirror where they sit the passenger side he_add
even_if woman clamor loud than man for vanity_mirror as one big automaker say they do place just one on the passenger 's side make little sense dr. gartman say since family now have a car for each adult in the household which mean woman be probably drive themselves and their child
for the first_time more woman than man be in the driver 's seat accord_to a study release last_year by the university of michigan 's transportation research institute
in_2010 the report say 105.7 million woman be license to drive in the nation compare_with 104.3 million man reverse a longtime gender gap
yet some automaker be not cater to those woman at the wheel
on the nissan versa sedan a passenger side vanity be optional on the sv version and standard on the sl with no driver side mirror available for either model
and for all smart car a vanity be standard for the passenger but not even an option for the driver
it certainly have nothing to do with gender role john curl a regional product manager for nissan say of the versa about half of which be buy by woman
we have only enough money for one mirror and we decide it should go on the passenger 's side he say add that regardless of gender the driver can use the rear view mirror while a vanity_mirror could be a driver distraction
it would be exceedingly odd if_you only have one to put it on the driver 's side he_add
i_think you would get customer complaint
but accord_to chrome data version_of three 2013 vehicle the chevrolet spark dodge journey and honda cr z do just that
dr. gartman the sociologist say the boom in man 's cosmetic and plastic surgery suggest_that man be just as vain about their appearance as woman
but if vanity be gender neutral request for vanity_mirror be not say justin healy the global overhead system supervisor for engineering at ford
he say that when ford survey s.u.v. driver in_2009 about their favorite visor feature 54 percent of all respondent ask for a mirror
among woman the figure be 70_percent
he say dual vanity_mirror be standard in 90_percent of ford vehicle the exception be commercial vehicle and entry level car
but in those with a solo mirror why give it to the passenger
we_'re hedge our bet that the driver will use the rear view mirror for a quick check mr. healy say
or maybe not mary sipes vice_president for global planning and program management at general_motors look into that in 2005 when she be a vehicle line director
she ask engineer to climb into an s.u.v. and check their teeth after eat broccoli

this thing that i do be an example of who i be a very mechanical robotic person i discover that about myself mr._obeid say
originally he undertake the 1,000-day project to accelerate his evolution as a comic
he be inspire partly by the 10,000-hour rule popularize by the writer malcolm gladwell which say that an extreme amount_of practice be require to become exceptional in a cognitively demanding pursuit
mr._obeid say he have be perform every_day for around a year when he hear of another comic hal sparks who have do so for two consecutive year
so mr._obeid become determined to break the record he pick a round number 1,000 and establish rule
to qualify he would need to tell joke for a minimum of three minute and his set have to be present as a comedy show
reflect on his accomplishment mr._obeid sound proud if slightly weary
i_'ve be die for this to be over for the last_year he say
his streak may be unprecedented but mr._obeid be still one of many comic who perform nightly in multiple show
the feat also raise a question often discuss in stand_up circle how long do it take to master the art
natural talent vary and there be very funny young comic today like michael che who have have a_lot of success in a short time but the virtue of pay your due be not only deeply ingrain but it be also often talk_about with great specificity in comedy
mr. gladwell focus_on hour but comedian be more_likely to talk in year
in his address at the just for laughs festival this_year colin quinn say it take 10_year just to know if_you be good
in an_e mail the comic amy schumer get even more granular estimate that if_you have a talent for comedy and work at it at_least four night a week you_can come_up with a good 10-minute set in three_year
a solid hour consistently take 10_year she write
i_think maybe i do_not know that some comic emphasize year live instead of time onstage hint at another argument that stand_up a personal art form that rely_on the strength of one voice require life experience as much as practice
in an_interview with the web_site splitsider.com pete holmes a stand_up comic with a late_night talk_show on tbs start next_month argue against focus exclusively on perform
i_think you need to live a life worth comment on he say
ken reid a comic from boston with 11 year of experience add that you_can practice yourself out of be interesting
you need enough skill to be_able to express yourself he say but i would much rather see an unpolished raw voice
mr._obeid say he have think_about this point but conclude_that rigorous compulsive enterprise be a reflection of who he be
people have tell_me we do_not know who you be
we just see jokes,'â he say
now i be like
that ' just me
i be a robot
i do_not care
i be a machine
i stay in do work go to bed
at the same_time he recognize that his relentless schedule play a part in the breakup with his girlfriend
she be patient but want more from me but i do_not give it because i_want to put this first he say sound downbeat
when she be go i_realize i could have compromise
still his career have take off
he make his late_night television debut on_wednesday on conan
he ' work on a book and a documentary_about the streak
after a 10-day rest which begin after his 1,001st straight show in san_francisco on_saturday mr._obeid will embark_on a college tour
he say his onstage confidence be high than ever his writing lean
with the tone of a war veteran he talk_about the night his streak almost end
on one sunday late in his run after fail to be book at the punch line in san_francisco mr._obeid be in a panic that the project would falter so he show up unannounced at a bar where he once appear at an open mike night
after much plead the manager turn_off the karaoke machine to let him perform but he be greet with hostility and cursing
five_minute in a karaoke fan come_up to mr._obeid pretend to ask for a fist bump but instead punch him in the stomach
the music be turn back on and the karaoke resume
i_'d already do my five_minute so i do_not care mr._obeid say relief washing over his face
it be worth it

when a friend invite teal pennebaker to a party in the nation_'s capital ms. pennebaker have just one question i ask her will there be a_lot of jonahs there?'â she_say
ms. pennebaker 31 a washington- base policy writer be refer_to jonah ryan the white_house liaison to the vice_president 's_office on hbo 's veep and one of the show 's deliciously obnoxious character memorable as much for bask in his proximity to power as for his attempt_to use what little status he have to get sex
it_' a dead on very apt way to describe a certain type_of d.c. guy ms. pennebaker say
it_' such a great descriptor
oh he ' such a jonah or that party will be all jonahs
let_'s not go.'â for those curious the answer come_back no the party be a jonah free zone
if aaron sorkin 's west wing represent an idealized democratic presidency powerful people do good_thing and inspire a swath of young viewer to enter public_service the late generation of political television offer a more dystopian vision of the nation_'s capital
the distinctly dark house of cards on netflix serve up powerful people do bad_thing while scandal on abc provide powerful people do bad_thing in what they believe be in the service of good_thing
but veep which be in the running for four emmy_awards this sunday include one for best comedy manage to repurpose politics as lowbrow farce and offer perhaps the most realistic glimpse at the banal task humdrum day and outsize ego that make up the daily life of the city 's political staff_member largely powerless people do thing
as such the character in the show which revolve_around fictional vice_president selina meyer play by julia louis dreyfus and her often hapless always curse staff have quickly become an in the know byword for certain d.c. archetype in the same_way that sex and the city capture a whole generation of woman as carries or mirandas
these_thing work their way into our vocabulary particularly in self referential community that like see themselves portray in the medium say ron klain a former chief of staff to vice presidents joseph r. biden and al gore
i_think in all profession people like shorthand way of refer_to thing and use popular culture reference to refer_to thing
and i_think washington in particular love to see itself portray on television or love to see itself portray in the movie
for bill burton a former deputy press secretary for president_obama veep allusion have become a convenient way to capture a certain type_of washington social climb behavior
a situation will occur and i will say do you watch veep
that ' totally what jonah would do,'â
mr. burton say
the jonah be the most spot on depiction of washington ever construct
i know 100 guy like that
though jonah or in the word of mr. klain be an obnoxious pompous jerk
may be the prototype that have most pervade the washington lexicon almost_every character on the show can serve_as a convenient nickname for a certain overly eager overly machinate and overly self promote washington staff_member
there be dan egan the handsome ambitious quick witted and even quicker talk deputy director of communication
there be sue wilson the brusque and efficient keeper of the gate
there be gary walsh the vice_president 's body man always at the ready with his trusty bag itself nickname the leviathan to anticipate his bos 's late whim
i_'ve hear people refer_to junior staffer who have to do personal stuff for the principal as oh he have gary 's job or he ' do gary work,'â mr. klain say
there be also mike mclintock who have be vice_president meyer 's director of communication since her time in the senate but now seem largely a lumbering dead tree relic in a hyper speed twitter world 1_2 next_page

executive confirm the deal on_friday insist on anonymity_because the network do_not want_to make an official announcement
still the decision represent a distinct vote of confidence in mr. greenblatt who be put in place by the new comcast management of nbc in_january 2011 with the specific charge to reverse the long slide that have sink nbc deep into last place in the network prime_time rating
nbc experience a bit of resurgence last fall especially with show like the voice and revolution then suffer another fallow period in the winter

montclair n.j. glacier an enthralling and important new dance work last 60 minute by the choreographer liz gerring abound in arrest contradiction
the dancer look relaxed and galvanize
they hurl themselves into impetuous slide skim across the stage in nimble footwork push their way urgently backward on all four shimmer in turn or bob jump and yet amid the formal structure always keep an informal quality never let the step acquire any veneer of academicism
step look natural athletic and exploratory even when they then come around a second or third time with other dancer
the work have wit without quirkiness passion without emotionalism its mood change like the weather and its ebb and flow carry aspect_of poetry and excitement
this work 's world premiere be give on_thursday as part_of the peak performances series at the alexander kasser theater at montclair state_university where robert wierzel 's design make virtuoso use of the stage
the main area be back by a single white board like a blank cinema screen
this however be just the central panel of an all white triptych so lighted by mr. wierzel that we first wonder_if we_'re watch mirror effect on either side
this question be further by ms._gerring 's choreography which at time differentiate between the main stage area dance and visible wing space nondance but at other moment let the dance carry on into the wing as if break_down boundary and world
the piece be marvelously heighten by michael_j. schumacher 's music from which the piece take its title
he incorporate a field recording of sound from a summer sojourn near glacier lake in colorado into a score tap not play live for guitar harp cello clarinet recorder piano and other keyboard instrument
at time pattern of sparse descend two note piano phrase recall debussy 's ãtude we seem close to the flapping of wing an overlap of different instrument suggest not musical harmony but a soundscape of wide multiplicity
pleasure in this work be clinch by how individual ms._gerring 's dancer look and how specifically release by this choreography
i have admire benjamin asriel in work by several contemporary choreographer
here he arrive relatively late in the piece he look newly focus but free
in one phrase as he tip slowly forward on one leg in an arabesque line he become like the needle of a magnetic compass piercingly direct in his adjustment of the angle
brandon collwes best_know from his year with the merce cunningham dance company have always dance with a large_scale innocence here that quality gain new intensity
step repeatedly onto the ball of one foot in a series of turn but each time tilt his torso way to one side he make you feel in your_own body the physic of the step
tony neidenbach adele nickel brandin steffensen jake szczypek jessica weiss and claire westby complete the team change the mood with each entry
entrance and exit be lively ingredient of ms._gerring 's style
often she make compositional joke out of them no sooner bring a dancer onstage than send_him off again only to recall him a moment later this time for an_extended stay
two woman end a duet with an unforgettable exit
side by side they find_themselves hold hand as they jump upward from both foot slowly retreat on a diagonal path it_' the way that they parallel and synchronize in this wonderful image of naã¯vete hover artlessly in each jump that catch the heart
mr. neidenbach a longtime gerring performer of marvelously athletic presence enter by go around in a circle on one side of the stage as he alternately run and walk
that alternation run a half circle then walk another with minimum gear change repeatedly be one of the dance contrast that proliferate in this piece rivetingly
later hauntingly mr. neidenbach cross the stage in one forward skip hopscotch sequence of tiny but top speed step then without miss a beat retreat backward in a big crawling phrase on all four two utterly opposed kind_of movement both deliver coolly but excitingly
another beauty of the gerring style be the keen focus she give to her dancer
they do_not just do movement they aim it
witness the opening phrase a man and a woman enter together stand and wait look and bend forward
and then simultaneously they turn their eye head and one arm upward and sideways
a simple stroke it at once establish the full three dimensionality of their style
a late motif also basic be a side to side phrase in which the dancer throw up a right arm then step the other way the left arm
the head turn to look_at the view the arm have open up
as you watch you sense yourself do it
at first glacier look_like a study in stylized pedestrianism flat foot with the dancer show how exactly they perform nonvirtuoso move
but its texture build up and grow complicated
woman then man travel on half toe across the stage jump and turn enter the vocabulary
there be eight dancer though usually few be onstage at any one time it become customary to see several thing go on simultaneously
simple movement remain central as when four man stand in a row face us with arm outspread
one woman enter seem to listen_to one man 's heart two other woman unnoticing dance in the background
dancer here be primarily soloist
but partner do occur both same_sex and especially opposite sex
there_' a sequence for three male female couple while the geometric patterning be satisfy they at one point correspond to the three screen behind there_' no_one moral pattern for male female behavior you see woman lead and support as_well as follow and be lift
as glacier deepen and grow in texture it change from a seemingly analytical study into a diverse world
the analytical quality which never vanish add fascination
the diversity add humanity
by scrutinize movement and demonstrate its multifaceted complexity glacier prove not only absorb but also move

as the pianist ahmad jamal and the member of the jazz at_lincoln center orchestra take their bow at the rose theater on_thursday night someone in the crowd file a simple but urgent request
poinciana
he shout against the applause poinciana
he shout again hoarsely
poinciana
poinciana poinciana
eventually reality set in the house light go up and the audience begin to file toward the door
poinciana in case the name mean nothing to you be a tune by nat simon that mr._jamal record with his trio in 1958
a small masterpiece of float groove careful in its application of pressure it belong_to the small society of jazz composition that have become runaway pop hit
just as take five define brubeck and desmond it have be an ageless signature for mr._jamal and maybe a bit of a burden give the irreducible scope of his output since
why should it matter that mr._jamal do_not play poinciana here amid the festive light pomp of the season opener for jazz at_lincoln center
he do play it in the same room a couple of year_ago likewise when he open jazz at_lincoln center 's 2008 9 season in a concert structure exactly like this one
and there be a welcome hint of the tune 's gait and bass line in saturday morning a quietly majestic ballad that mr._jamal offer in the first_half
so the omission mean nothing except perhaps as a metaphor
at the end of an elegant two hour concert that showcased mr._jamal 's capacity for build tension within tight space it be bewilderingly easy to feel unfulfilled
just as that guy bark his request do i leave the rose theater in disappointment think_about miss opportunity
for me it be not about a song but rather a spirit of engagement
mr._jamal 83 organize his music as a series of dynamic event pinballing between binary extreme loud/soft fast/slow big/small
during the concert 's first_half which feature reginald veal on bass herlin riley on drum and manolo badrena on percussion he run the bandstand like a contractor survey a job site often turn from the piano to wave an arm or shoot a glare
every song in the quartet 's 40-minute set involve a form of latin rhythm and every song end with a crisp decisive snap
mr. riley and mr. veal make an ideal rhythm team for this music just as they have for wynton marsalis jazz at_lincoln center 's artistic_director
on morning mist and silver they lay an earthy foundation trancelike but alert
they be impeccable on_saturday morning the title track of mr._jamal 's new album on the jazz village label which feature the same personnel
but the whole mood be terse rein in
that extended to the concert 's second_half feature enlargement of mr._jamal 's music by member of the jazz at_lincoln center orchestra
one problem be the harmonic inertia of the material baalbek in an arrangement by the alto saxophonist sherman irby could_not gather much forward pull even during a trumpet solo by mr. marsalis
it be his only solo all night which make the concert 's title ahmad jamal and wynton marsalis a little misleading
where the second_half hit its stride be in two arrangement that capture the variability of mr._jamal 's style
the trumpeter marcus printup make manhattan reflection into an episodic saga with punchy accent give way to grand flow gesture
and the saxophonist ted nash give kaleidoscope a marvelous range of idea include a burst of dixielandish counterpoint follow by a lush canopy of modern chord in descend sequence
then after an interlude by mr._jamal the band rev back into gear swing hard behind a command solo by the trombonist elliot mason
somehow this be the evening 's only stretch of swing rhythm but that be not why it feel_like a revelation
it be because mr._jamal and the band seem both lock in and free for a few fleeting moment they leave nothing to be desire
ahmad jamal appear through saturday at the rose theater jazz at_lincoln center 60th street and broadway 212 721 6500 jalc.org
this_article have be_revise to_reflect the follow_correction:correction september_24 2013a music review on_saturday about the opening concert of the jazz at_lincoln center season feature the pianist ahmad jamal misidentified the composer of poinciana which become a pop hit for mr._jamal when he record it with his trio in 1958
it be compose by nat simon not by mr._jamal

london the americans be come and the british literary world be not happy
the man_booker prize which have be open to english_language novel from britain and the commonwealth have just go global produce anxiety about damage to cultural diversity and fear that the american cultural hyperpower that dominate movie and television will crush the small literary novel
it_' rather like a british company be take_over by some worldwide conglomerate say melvyn bragg an author and television host in britain
the booker_prize for fiction begin in 1969 be always something that britain and its former territory could call their_own see as a bulwark against the spread of the american novel that globalize product of the world 's rich market
the award with its publicity its paycheck and its immediate impact on sale have be an_important boost to the career of canadians like michael ondaatje and yann martel and indians like kiran desai and aravind adiga
it have bring attention to novelist previously unknown and unpublished in the united_states and it have be an_important encouragement to publisher of quality fiction
this_week the chairman of the booker_prize foundation jonathan taylor say we be abandon the constraint of geography and national boundary to become a truly international prize as a result of consultation that begin in_2011
the change could enhance the booker 's prestige and reputation through expansion rather_than by set_up a separate prize for americans he say
next_year the prize will be open to any work originally write in english and publish in britain not just work by citizen of britain the commonwealth ireland and zimbabwe bring immediate concern that american novel will dominate simply through an economic superpower exert its_own literary taste the british novelist philip hensher who have be both a booker finalist and a judge say in an_interview
more troubling he say will be the loss of new interesting voice

when nbc announce recently that today would host a book_club feature online discussion group i_think it be a fine idea
i have long romanticize my flesh and blood book_club in manhattan because it make me feel as if an_important group value me
when i describe fellow member to other people i lead with their strength and accomplishment a brilliant ex banker a onetime speechwriter for a sit vice_president and a powerful intellectual with a global following
but the truth be we be a bunch of yenta who sometimes read the same book superficially discuss it in a most erudite way we think and then move on to our favorite subject ourselves
fail marriage high achieve kid and kitchen renovation be just as likely_to be topic of discussion as the nuance of daniel deronda
and sometimes frankly there be more blood than flesh
last winter a particularly ugly encounter about_whether we could deviate from our practice of alternate classic and contemporary fiction end with an expletive send my way
that night i walk_out of the gathering tell two people within earshot i would never return
i have long dismiss online book_club believe they lack the intimacy and spontaneity of in person get togethers and that they be the terrain of quiet loner who fear eye contact and physical closeness
these_day i have come to think book_club intimacy be largely overrated and depend_on who ' on the other end eye contact can be quite terrifying
i be far from alone
for eileen mendell of ventnor n.j. book_club meeting frequently resemble explosive family counseling session where every infraction become indicative of a deep character flaw
i have personality clash with just about everybody and normally i be a happy friendly cheerful person so it_' strictly the book group that give_me problem ms. mendell say
there be some woman who talk_about their child nonstop and express no interest in anyone_else 's child
yet ms. mendell balk at the suggestion that she may fit in better with an online club
it sound so cold she_say
i_'d much rather suffer through the meeting than not see their face
maybe i enjoy be a curmudgeon
and maybe i do_not want_to give_up my cantankerousness
many_people though have come to see online book_club as an ideal arrangement

it could be because of edward_j. snowden
but it_' more_likely the influence of homeland
government secret and betrayal be at the heart of two of the better new network drama this_season
hostage on cbs and the blacklist on nbc which both start on_monday
like homeland the c.i.a. thriller on showtime that begin a third season on_sept. 29 these show be immerse in washington intrigue
each pivot on a heroine who be tear between confrontation and collusion with a male adversary
both be suspenseful and artfully layered and both owe a debt to homeland
but they also share at_least one inherent weakness with that showtime hit
hostage star toni collette as dr. ellen sanders a surgeon whose family be take captive by a rogue f.b.i._agent duncan carlisle dylan mcdermott
carlisle then order ellen to make her most_famous patient die on the operating table
do_n't think of it as kill the president carlisle say
think of it as save your family
there be a murky conspiracy at the top but even ellen 's seemingly normal suburban husband and two child have secret agenda of their_own
on the blacklist a young f.b.i._agent elizabeth keen megan boone be pair with an unlikely partner raymond reddington james spader a former government agent turn criminal consigliere who sell secret and abets mobster thief and terrorist worldwide
in the pilot reddington turn himself in and offer to help the f.b.i. track down his blacklist of master criminal but on the condition that he deal only with elizabeth
the show also borrow a bit from silence of the lambs but in this case mr._spader chew the scenery not human kidney
the many layer of feint and puzzle be compelling but it_' hard to see how they can last more_than a season or two
the first two episode of season 3 of homeland be disappointing and that ' almost inevitable
conventional television_show be call series for a reason whether it be bonanza or law order svu these be serial drama engineer to last with replaceable character and story line that begin and end in under an hour
the best show these_day be more like movie than serial with narrative arc that sweep the action and the lead character to a fix conclusion
and subsequent season be more like movie sequel even good one rarely live up to the first and the more there be the more they strain to work
show with two duel character moreover tend_to have short shelf life than those with a single central villain
tony soprano keep his criminal enterprise go for six season walter white of break_bad be on the verge of shut_down after five and woman sometimes outlast the man nancy botwin the pot deal heroine of weeds hang on for a remarkable eight season
when a drama follow the collision course of two enemy of the opposite sex sooner or later they have to consummate their love or their hate
it_' not just sexual tension that wear off after contact so do the piquancy of conflict
the conceit of the first season of homeland be that carrie claire danes alone suspect that the p.o.w.-turn hero brody damian lewis be a traitor by the end of the second season only she believe he be innocent
that formula can hold a viewer 's attention for only so long before it start to feel force
the third season do_not just stretch credulity it try patience brody be not in the first two episode there be not even a scene foreshadow his imminent return and there be only so_many time viewer can watch carrie go off her medication or brody 's teenage daughter dana morgan saylor act out
the brody family dynamic be not the one that count in this spy thriller it_' carrie 's dysfunctional c.i.a. family that matter
fortunately at_least one character her mentor saul mandy patinkin dance to a new tune
los_angeles the emmy_awards have witness many new player on the red_carpet over the year but there have never be a gate crasher quite like netflix
its house of cards be nominate for outstanding drama the first_time that a program distribute on the internet have compete at the emmys right alongside program distribute through rabbit ear and satellite dish
and the prospect that a stream video service like netflix could end_up a winner at the emmys ceremony on_sunday night have cast a spotlight on just how profoundly the television landscape have change
still most television critic and other self profess emmys expert suspect that it_' the cable_channel amc not netflix that will have the most to celebrate at the award show
break_bad which have be nominate for best drama four time before but have never win be the clear favorite this_year
in an_e mail debra birnbaum the editor in chief of tv guide magazine borrow a phrase from the series meth lord walter white â break_bad be the danger this emmy season
and that ' with just the first_half of the show 's final_season in contention for an emmy this_year
amc break the season into two part and only the first_half be televise before the may cutoff date for emmy eligibility
but the second_half start to be show in_august just as emmy voter be receive their ballot in the mail
what ' more the review have be uniformly glowing and the rating have be build as the sept._29 finale approach
last_sunday 's episode which generate more_than 16,000 twitter message a minute at one point be the most watch episode yet with at_least 6.4 million_viewer
so it stand to reason that the emmy result may reflect all the excitement
ballot be due on_aug. 30
this_week the web_site gold derby which track hollywood 's horse race call break_bad the overwhelming front_runner
as it turn_out the series will be compete_with the emmys televise by cbs on_sunday night
the three hour backslapping ceremony will begin at_8 p.m. eastern while the 75-minute penultimate episode of break_bad will begin at 9_p.m.
since the drama prize be hand out last break_bad viewer can change channel afterward to see if the show win
and if it do_n't well the second_half of the final_season will be eligible again in 2014
for amc an emmy for break_bad would be a welcome acknowledgment of how it like netflix have change television
until 2008 the only winner of the top drama emmy the most covet of all be broadcast network and hbo.
then mad man come along and amc become the first ad support cable_channel to win the top drama award
mad_men keep win for four season in a row until showtime 's homeland snap its streak last_year
this time around both be nominate again along_with break_bad house of cards pbs 's downton abbey and hbo 's game of thrones
netflix wo_not say how_many people have watch house of cards
hbo 's throne may be the most_popular of the six hbo say the season finale in_june attract nearly 14 million_viewer once on demand viewership be calculate
about 12_million people saw the season finale of downton abbey more_than seven million saw homeland and nearly five million saw mad man
for the second year in a row no drama from the big four broadcast network be nominate
but the broadcaster be somewhat better represent in the best comedy category where abc 's modern family be vie for its fourth straight win
it be up against nbc 's 30 rock which end in may and be eligible_for the final time cbs 's big bang theory hbo 's girl and veep and fx 's louie
the one netflix comedy series that some thought would be nominate arrest development be not
but one of the star of arrested jason bateman be up for best lead actor in a comedy
back on the drama side kevin spacey and robin wright be both up for lead actor and actress for house of cards
bruce rosenblum the chairman of the academy of television arts and sciences say that netflix 's nomination illustrate the evolve nature of tv. this be just the beginning he say
if_you look_at the quantity of product be develop at netflix and amazon and hulu and xbox it_' certainly reasonable to expect that this evolution will accelerate
have say that the quality of content on broadcast and cable be certainly at an all time high as_well
netflix 's presence at the emmys be the result of rule that be amend about six_year ago to allow some but not all internet show
netflix be technically already a winner it pick_up two award for casting and cinematography last_weekend at the creative arts portion of the emmys
but to put that in context hbo pick_up 20 include eight for its tv movie behind the candelabra
the record creative arts ceremony will be show by fxx on_saturday
the prime_time ceremony on cbs will take stock of what many observer have call a golden age of tv.
there remain a wide gulf however between the audience for the academy awards which draw about 40_million viewer this_year and the emmys which attract about 13 million in 2012
the academy awards have some advantage namely movie star and 10 brand new film in competition each year
the emmys on the other_hand often celebrate returning show with relatively_small audience
but mr. rosenblum voice confidence that the rating for the emmys would defy trend line and grow over time
the industry be accelerate from a quality standpoint and from a buzz and pop culture standpoint he say and that at some point will be reflect in our rating
enough please about the cultural elite that all but useless category so baggy it now seem to include practically everyone
no what_we really want_to know about be the cultural elect the famous people other famous people connive to meet
the kind_of people that be who be likely_to be find in the upper west_side apartment of antonio monda whether it_' a half_dozen novelist and spouse for sunday brunch or weeknight dinner or the 75 to 120 journalist critic painter curator columbia professor and more who crowd in to the after party for one of the almost continuous film relate event he run either as organizer or interviewer or both at_lincoln center the morgan library and the museum of modern art
recent sighting include philip roth scrunch in a corner under the bookshelf that cover an entire wall robert de niro who stride in a beat after martin amis slip out to smoke a hand roll cigarette zadie smith spring up from the table to chase down her toddler and jovanotti the bearded king of italian rap whose twitter follower at one point outnumber the pope 's
at a time when so_many manhattan gathering can seem as transactional as a conference call mr._monda reign as the host of the city 's lively some say only remain cultural salon
only do_not tell_him so
the word salon make him wince
in italy it give the impression of be lightweight mr._monda who will turn 51 next_month say recently in his office at new_york university where he be a member of the film and television department 's faculty
he prefer laboratory of idea
mr._monda 's normal style be casual but he be expect at a gala later and so be sheathe in a blue brioni suit purchase at a discount courtesy of his friend gay talese with purple suspender and a blue tie dot with red
mr._monda 's_office be both archive and storefront
the wall be cover with movie poster and still and the bookshelf include translation of his book many of them collect interview with a range of eminence like don delillo and martin scorsese
laboratory seem a clinical description for mr._monda 's cozy at home but admirer agree that his party generate unusual excitement
there_' always a crackle of energy in the air the novelist colum mccann who have know mr._monda since_2007 write in an_e mail
what antonio be essentially interested_in be have people bounce off one another so that what result be the art of great conversation
there be for_instance the night mr._monda screen luchino visconti 's film the leopard base_on the classic italian novel then lead a discussion on the challenge of adaptation and dubbing
the conversation flow easily and be mercifully free of self promotion
nobody go to a monda lunch to sell a book or flog a new movie mr. mccann observe
it would be very vulgar to take out a stack of business card
the good talk be lubricate by sumptuous but unpretentious dining
i_think the secret to his party be the food isabella rossellini a longtime friend say in a phone_interview
the food be there for everyone
it_' abundant
and you come and go as you please
at mr._monda 's she can be see in a sweater and jean get up to refill her plate with the home cooked meal prepare by mr._monda 's wife jacqueline greaves who be bear in jamaica and have create her_own fusion of island and classic italian cuisine empanadas shrimp ball crostini with pesto and mushroom pasta with a hearty tuna sauce with pine nut cinnamon raisin bowl of giant strawberry wash down with chianti or a white wine purchase in the neighborhood
such improvisation would be unthinkable at other manhattan dinner_party
paparazzo be around ms. rossellini say
you have to show you_'re the best dress that you_'re young and thin
every time i be invite i have to evaluate do i have to have a makeup artist how_much do the dress cost
it_' very commercial
informal though he be mr._monda a screenwriter and filmmaker before he move to the united_states in 1994 impart an air of the grande spettacolo to all his production include his n.y.u. course to which he invite guest lecturer like the coen brother and wes anderson
mr._monda play himself in a brief scene in the life aquatic with steve zissou
sometimes director ask_me to appear in their film he say
i never say no
he do seem custom build for the part_of the italian intellectual erudite yet effusive bound from one topic to the next the short story of isaac bashevis singer the religious theme coil inside the subversive film of pier paolo pasolini the curious parallel between italian and jewish american literature each found on the unique relationship_with religion with culture with aristocracy

michel say marine corps general joseph dunford who head isaf be try_to insulate the training command from any fallout from the procurement problem
if_they downscale some of our infrastructure and cut aircraft there_' a degrading effect on our capacity he say
all of these become impediment to our success while we fight the clock
michel who arrive on the job seven week_ago say about 70_percent of the hangar taxiway and other infrastructure need to support the air_force which be due to expand to around 8,000 people from 7,000 be complete
but he say he fear the remain 30_percent may never get build if problem identify in a recent report by the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar lead to project cancellation
you have to have concrete and building to operate from he say
small but mighty the training mission be be lead by 649 u.s. military adviser contractor and adviser from other nato force

security at six training site in afghanistan be another worry with attack or threat set back training effort and force trainer to reinforce security he say
the more we have to do those kind_of security mission the more we have to degrade training he say

that question michel say could have big implication for the training effort and be be debate by dunford the marine corps general and afghan leader
we_'re go to consume 15 to 20_percent of their budget
we_need to know today if that ' sustainable michel say

but who know that the y once try_to book a poetry read by mao zedong
i have write to chairman mao grace schulman the center 's director at the time write to one of his translator in 1974 two_year after president richard_m. nixon 's visit to china
she go on to describe the skeptical reaction she receive from a poet name chang at the united_nations after tell_him my plan and how important it be for chairman mao to read his poem aloud i hear him laugh uncontrollably for quite some time
but i still hope mao will come
mao do_not come
but ms. schulman 's letter unearth during a scouring of the poetry center 's archive in preparation for a 75th anniversary season that begin this_month stand as one of the more quixotic episode in the center 's long commitment to the live literary voice
during the anniversary season that literary voice can be hear as usual onstage
it can also be sample on the internet thanks to 75 at 75 a series pair 75 recording from the poetry center 's audio archive it contain more_than 2,000 reading with specially commission essay
and start on_sept. 25 love the word an exhibition will be in the y 's lobby gallery
it draw on previously unseen photo and rare correspondence from the like of t. s. eliot dylan thomas and robert lowell to illuminate the center 's role in new_york 's literary history
these_day it can seem_like every bookstore bar and bowling alley in the city have be take_over by writer seek to read their work in public
but when the poetry center open its door in 1939 with a lineup include william carlos williams w. h. auden and langston hughes the idea that live performance be an essential part_of a writer 's job be new
this just be not part_of what writer do at the time bernard schwartz the center 's director say during a recent preview of material from the archive
they treat the occasion as more_than business as usual he_add
today an invitation to read at the y many writer say arrive like a quasi divine summons
the mother of all lectern the poet billy collins_say recently when ask to describe the y 's more than-900-seat kaufmann hall ring with name like aristotle maimonides and shakespeare spell out in gold leaf
when you read there you_'re aware that just about every writer you have ever admire have go before you say the playwright tony kushner who begin attend reading at the y as an undergraduate at_columbia in the 1970
you do_not feel_like you_'re be judge
you feel_like you have_already be judge
love the word put_together by mr._schwartz and ava lehrer contain plenty such testimonial along_with glimpse of less high minded aspect_of the enterprise
truman capote in 1964 ask_if the center could up the standard honorarium still mod today accord_to mr._schwartz to $_1,000
leonard cohen invite the following year say he be happy with $_100
and when the elderly robert frost give a reading usher be dispatch to fill empty seat
i be in the position to watch the madness of old age eat away some of the old poet and composer elizabeth kray the center 's director at the time write in 1960 to the poet donald hall
one outward sign be their desire for public attention
with mr. frost this be a mania
marianne moore by_contrast say in a 1964 letter that she would read only if there be no â hero atmosphere declare it_' regulation or nothing
for her regulation mean wear a tricorn hat and paul revere ish jacket show in a photograph include in the show
elizabeth bishop decline the y 's invitation for decade i suffer too_much and i do_not think people enjoy see someone miserable she write in 1950 then request that a recording of her first reading there in 1973 be destroy
it be though two other bishop reading survive in the center 's collection
the y whose lineup today be heavy on novelist than poet have also coax some notably retire prose writer into the limelight
don delillo give his first reading for the general public there in 1990
i_'m glad it_' over he write in a note afterward
he have since do three more reading at the y.
the center have long be know for its onstage pairing which this_season include allan gurganus and donna tartt colum mccann and norman rush and paul auster and siri hustvedt who first meet at the y in 1981 and have be a couple ever_since
love the word also do some sly matchmaking of its_own

there you be you_'re sit there with your city sanitation and your senate and everything get beat by guy that do_not shower
it feel great he say
it be a_lot of fun
during his time at maxim mr._golin relish play the heel but he say he be never the lout or the lad he be portray as at the time
i play the violin he say
i do_not drink beer
he also do_not read maxim anymore
i_'ve never read another copy since i leave mr._golin say
i never would have read the thing if i do_not work there
the magazine be universally credit for what it_' worth with encapsulate a beer and babe ethos that help make career for people like megan fox and ashley greene even as it raise eyebrow and crinkle nose
but last_week it be sell with little fanfare for an undisclosed sum to darden media whose chairman calvin darden sr
issue a statement about expand the maxim brand into a cable network and other platform
he do_not return call for further comment
the magazine 's previous owner alpha media_group buy the publication and two others since shutter from dennis publishing for $ 250 million six_year ago
while magazine of every stripe be struggle with a decline in ad sale it seem safe to assert that maxim have perhaps outlive its power to provoke and titillate
though he no_longer read the magazine mr._golin be certain that the maxim man be still out there
what ' change he suggest be the culture that surround him
what have once be what mr._golin call a treehouse for a certain kind_of guy have perhaps become the forest
maxim expand out to be easily find in the general fabric of everything mr._golin say
it become expect and accept
look around mr._golin see sign of his former publication everywhere
probably one of the high gross movie or trilogy of movie be the bachelor,'â he say
do mr._golin perhaps mean the hangover
â the hangover
the hangover;'â he say
you_can also see some of the maxim man 's grasp ego in a character like kenny powers play by danny mcbride the blustery blubbery former major_league baseball pitcher on eastbound down on hbo.
on fox there_' schmidt play by max greenfield on new girl who present a more polished version_of a 90s era maxim guy and who embody the kind_of behavior deride by susan faludi in her 2000 book stiffed the betrayal of the american man in which she call maxim simpering and sneaky and describe it as a last blast of anachronistic masculinity
schmidt dress as if he just walk_out of a spread in detail but his roommate force him to put a dollar into a jar every time he blurt out another sexist or self regard comment
then there_' will ferrell whose every character from ricky bobby to ron burgundy to george_w. bush channel the wounded pride of overgrown boy live through what ' be call the end of man
i_think ultimately maxim win mr._golin say add that the sophomoric be now find in great abundance on the internet which make a monthly magazine of humor and innuendo less necessary
intend as a raspberry in the face of political correctness maxim be an overnight success follow its transplantation from britain by its owner felix dennis
if national review famously aim to stand athwart history yell stop maxim keg stand the era of identity politics and antioch consent rule

q. the unusual building at 1782 third avenue at 99th street be list as substation 7 on the national register of historic places but i can_not find any information_about it
why be it historic
a.
it_' a link to the el
joseph_j. cunningham an engineering historian and an authority on new_york city 's electrical power system say that this particular substation be one of seven building that provide power to the elevated train operate by the manhattan railway company on second third sixth and ninth avenues
the electrification project which begin in 1898 have its source in the main power station at 74th street and the east river mr. cunningham say in an_e mail
there be three substation on each side of manhattan and one in the bronx
the function of the substation be to receive 11,000-volt alternate current from the power house and convert it to 625-volt direct current for the third rail distribution system to the train
the power station and substation begin operate in late 1901 and all train be run by electric_power by the spring of 1903
so why be substation 7 historic
my supposition would be that it be because it be the last that resemble the original structure mr. cunningham say
the interborough rapid transit company the first major subway line lease the manhattan railway company in 1903 and their power system be interconnect he say
some substation be replace others remain until the el be demolish
no 7 be the primary supply of power for the upper portion of the lexington avenue subway from 1918 into at_least the late_1970 when other substation be construct underground
therefore it never become a commercial structure but be retain for other transit relate work such as storage or field crew space he say
it be still own by m.t.a. new_york city transit
by comparison he say substation 2 the only remain substation for the el on the west_side be reuse as a hardware and lumber store
while there be numerous retire substation that be build solely for the subway and many that date from the day of direct current utility power for residential and commercial customer no
7 be the only manhattan substation that date from the electrification of the pre subway elevated system and also retain its original appearance mr. cunningham say

milan when stuart weitzman decide to close his shoe box of a store on the via della spiga here and open a fancy new international flagship in the heart of milan 's shopping district he have three architect in mind frank gehry santiago calatrava or zaha hadid
mr._weitzman like to think big
this be the quirky 71-year old shoe designer who for many year before the recession like to make a splash at the oscar with his $_1 million diamond encrust heel which at the risk of appear tacky never fail to get attention
last_year he hire kate moss to appear in his advertising campaign
and people start to think of stuart weitzman who have be design sophisticated but not terribly expensive shoe in new_york since he work for his_father 's factory in the 1960 as a luxury brand
so he want the milan store to make a statement that mr._weitzman be right up there with ferragamo gucci and prada even_though most of his design be much less expensive
only the architect act as if_they have never hear of him
it take several cold call to ms. hadid 's london office before anyone would agree to hear mr._weitzman 's pitch and only then he say i get to her heart through her foot
woman love shoe
so there at the open party on the via sant'andrea on_thursday night be ms. moss wear a black pantsuit and a big smile as she breeze through a store design by ms. hadid as if it be the interior of a spaceship
mr._weitzman 's_signature over the knee boot and his new men' inspire pump many price under $ 400 be align on curve swirl display make of fiberglass with a rose gold trim with suede seat build at odd angle into the display
the gray wall curve inward like a cave make it hard for guest to stand if_they venture too close to the side
the shoe business be so_much more elevate today say mr._weitzman stand off to the side of the party which have spill out into a garden behind the store
women always have to have them but shoe be never as much a part_of their personality as they be today
it_' much_more democratic
at that moment a security_guard tap mr._weitzman on the shoulder and tell_him to move along as ms. moss be stand nearby
but he be on the list
as many woman will attest mr._weitzman be a remarkable shoe designer and in fact his fit model say that he will spend hour go over the placement of strap to make_sure there be not the slight bump against the foot
he have be design over the knee boot call 5050 they be leather in the front stretch fabric in the back for 20_year and still he feature the design which cost_$ 598 in his fall campaign again with ms. moss
they be again a top seller for the company
like the boot successful fashion be half product and half perception
the brand have go from start out as a shoemaker to be a part_of fashion he say
ms. hadid who be know for her futuristic architecture have previously design store for neil barrett and an art pavilion for chanel
she also have recently design shoe for united nude and melissa shoes but that be another story
i like shoe she_say in a telephone_interview
and i do think retail be really interesting
you often have department_store with very expensive clothes and only one mirror where you_can not see anything
maybe it_' a trick
her design for mr._weitzman be fill_with reflective surface and the seat be make with space for a woman to place her bag next to her rather_than on the floor
the idea be to propel a customer from the street right into the display
store be become big now ms. hadid say
they have to compete_with online
and there be another aspect_of shopping which be entertainment
you need that
mr._weitzman have more_than 100 store around the world include 3 others in italy
a quarter of the company 's annual sale which total about_$ 350 million come from its_own retail business so mr._weitzman who sell the label to the jones group in_2010 say it be important to create a new concept to entice shopper
ms. hadid 's store design will be recreate in five other location include a new_york store next_year
it be as much for our peer as it be for our customer mr._weitzman say
store like this have open up the eye of retailer around the world to our brand
they be like advertisement to other people in our industry
a store next to chanel on an exclusive retail strip of milan send a powerful message
so do have ms. moss as the star attraction at your party watch a video of herself walk in your boot
we_'re never go to sell enough shoe from that image to pay for that one ad mr._weitzman say

the number of civilian fire fatality in new_york city drop drastically last_year with roughly one third few death than in the previous year accord_to a report issue by the bloomberg_administration on_friday
there be 46 fire fatality in the 2013 fiscal_year compare_with 70 in 2012 accord_to the mayor 's management report
the report which have be issue by mayor for more_than three_decade be a data bonanza
it offer a comprehensive statistical look_at how every municipal agency be perform and be pack with detail on how the estimated 300,000 city employee be deliver service
mayor_michael r._bloomberg who build a business empire and his personal fortune on the dissemination of information have expand the amount_of detail in the report
they now cover everything from air quality crime and education to noise complaint pothole report and street cleanliness
with mr._bloomberg 's_tenure end soon this be the last time he will offer such a volume
in_addition to the drop in fire fatality one of the most striking statistic be the sharp rise in the number of people apply for food_stamp formally call the supplemental nutrition assistance program
there be 1.8 million new_yorkers receive nutritional assistance and the number have rise every year since_2003
it be now 124 percent high than when mr._bloomberg enter office
in many area there have be a marked improvement over the mayor 's term include a well document decline in violent crime
new_york city service have show constant improvement over the last 12 year despite multiple economic downturn and operational challenge like hurricane_sandy that have test our talented and dedicated workforce mr._bloomberg say in a statement
city official_say the administration be particularly proud of the recent progress in reduce carbon_emission in government building part_of a broad effort to reduce_emission citywide by 30_percent by 2030
hurricane_sandy 's continue effect be reflect in data from a number of agency most_notably the department of transportation
the number of street that need repair jump 40,000 to 241,572 accord_to the report
then there be the perennial challenge that be a part_of urban life like graffiti
as graffiti disappear from subway and roll up gate go out of fashion with the drop in crime graffiti have fade as an urgent subject or symbol of blight
in_2011 the responsibility for clean graffiti move from the department of sanitation to the economic development corporation

that be the equivalent of 91 acre
after hour of harsh questioning from a defense_lawyer the psychologist testify for prosecutor twist ever so slightly in the witness stand
how could it be the defense_lawyer have ask that 20 other doctor examine the defendant a portuguese fashion model and conclude he be in the throe of a manic episode at the time he kill his companion and only you determine that he be fake it
how could it be that the rule book for your profession say a manic episode can come on rapidly and yet you insist_that the book be wrong on that point
and how could you conclude_that the defendant who have a degree in physical education from a college in portugal learn_how to invent an insanity defense in a college psychology class without have any idea whether he even take such a class
with that william b. barr shift a bit in the witness chair
he tilt his head to one side but he do_not lose his cool
it_' my assumption that get a general degree from a university that chance be that someone have study psychology he answer calmly
as an expert witness dr._barr be among a select group of mental_health professional in new_york city who regularly play a central role in criminal proceeding and he have become something of the go to man for prosecutor when the mental_health of a defendant be at issue
there be no record of exactly how often an expert appear for either side but since 2000 dr._barr have be hire by prosecutor as a consultant in more_than 100 such case he testify last_year
because_they be hire largely by word of mouth among like minded lawyer it be all but inevitable that the same expert will be repeatedly call
yet most try_to avoid testify more frequently for one side to avoid the appearance that they be tailor their conclusion to the need of the lawyer who most often hire them
dr._barr 's role be often to tell juror that defendant who may_seem mentally_ill do_not meet the legal definition of insanity at the moment they be say to have commit their crime
and his testimony follow an almost predictable pattern defendant be exaggerate a mental impairment and act out of rage
his first major case be the 1999 trial of andrew goldstein who push a young_woman to her death in front of a subway train
dr._barr testify that mr. goldstein be exaggerate his mental_illness and may actually have attention deficit disorder
yet under cross examination dr._barr acknowledge_that he have not read mr. goldstein 's 3,500-page medical history which include repeat diagnosis of schizophrenia
he give similar testimony in the 2007 trial of peter braunstein a former magazine writer convict of sexually assault a former colleague after dress as a firefighter to get into her apartment
dr._barr testify that mr. braunstein exaggerate symptom of schizophrenia during test give answer that be so off the chart that if it be valid it would be one of the most severe form of schizophrenia ever observe in the world
dr._barr 's method and even his mere presence in court have become an increase focus of trial in which he participate
in the trial last fall of the portuguese fashion model renato seabra a defense_lawyer rubin sinins ask dr._barr if he simply cut and paste into his report that mr. seabra act out of rage
an expert for the defense dr. roger martin harris the former director of psychiatric unit at several local hospital who now teach forensic psychiatry at new_york medical college testify that dr._barr be create his_own diagnostic system in ignore definition in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders sometimes refer_to as the bible of mental disorder
i respectfully think that dr._barr be go out of his way try_to make mr. seabra responsible_for the crime dr. harris say 1_2 3_4 next_page
rome
from the moment he be introduce to the huge crowd wait for a new pope in the rain at st. peter 's square pope_francis have be a surprise
people gasp when his name be call out
he be 76 seemingly another rigid conservative not the young dynamic figure many catholics have hop for
now six_month later the surprise keep come include the pope 's new remark that the church risk become a small chapel overly fixate on sexual morality and should instead offer a broad more inclusive message
francis be challenge the status_quo of the roman_catholic church so determinedly and so unexpectedly that vatican watcher be debate whether this be merely a change of tone as many have think at first
some now think the pope may be make a deliberate effort to shake up the vatican govern hierarchy know as the curia and prepare the ground for a more fundamental shift in the direction of the church
i_think we be look_at major change say john thavis a longtime vatican observer and author of the vatican diaries
there be a_lot of disorientation inside the roman curia
they use to feel they be in charge
right_now they know they be not in charge
the late unexpected jolt from pope_francis come in an_interview conduct with a jesuit journalist and release thursday in jesuit publication around the world
francis himself a jesuit chastise the church 's narrow focus_on controversial social issue and call instead for a more merciful and less judgmental church
he have_already send out earlier signal decline to live in the papal apartment in the apostolic palace chide prelate for drive fancy car and announce that church property should be use as shelter for refugee
francis do try_to temper the impact of his remark on_friday tell an audience of catholic gynecologist that abortion be a symptom of our throwaway culture and urge them to refuse_to perform the procedure
but there seem little question that francis want_to change the papal conversation
his_predecessor benedict xvi often seem engaged in an angry verbal jousting match with secularism and modernity usually deliver through formal encyclical or speech that to many catholics feel_like a personal rebuke
the church seem_like a rigid institution dictate impossible norm to follow an overly severe mother say lucetta scaraffia a scholar of catholicism in rome
by_contrast pope_francis have make impromptu telephone call to people_who have write him letter seek help while also thrive on socialize with other priest and laypeople
he be assume the tone of the parish priest many_analyst say recognize that people struggle daily with issue of conscience and that the church rather_than shake a finger must offer a broad message of comfort and healing
many_analyst have seize on an analogy cite by francis in his interview the church as a hospital in a battlefield
people have be wound in a war over secularization say ms. scaraffia a history professor_at the university of rome la sapienza
he ' say let_'s look after the wound
that ' more important than win the war.'â the deep challenge confront the church become evident after benedict 's stunning decision to resign early this_year
allegation of mismanagement be erupt in the vatican and accusation of impropriety shake the vatican bank
many cardinal blame the problem on the secretive administrative body the roman curia and want benedict 's successor to usher in major reform that would decentralize power
pope_francis have_already signal his independence from some of the vatican 's traditional channel and his big governance move as yet have be the creation of an advisory group of eight outside cardinal to help him usher in curial reform
but in his interview he hint that big change could be come include possible structural change to the conference of bishop know as synod
he also pointedly warn_that certain department in the curia when function poorly risk become institution of censorship

caracas venezuela in the late diplomatic dispute between the united_states and venezuela american_official late thursday give permission for president nicolã¡s maduro to fly over puerto rico on his way to a state visit in china and deny angry accusation from venezuelan official that the united_states have try_to bar mr._maduro from its airspace
but venezuela 's accusation resonate among some of its leftist allies in the region who compare the contretemps to the incident in_july when president evo morales of bolivia be deny permission to fly over some european country because accord_to bolivian official they wrongly suspect his plane be carry edward_j. snowden the fugitive american intelligence leaker
leftist leader at the time accuse the united_states of be behind that incident although washington say it be not involve
on_thursday mr._maduro and foreign_minister elã­as jaua accuse the united_states of bar mr._maduro from american airspace call it an act of aggression
but on_friday roberta s. jacobson the united_states assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affair say that be not true and that the request have never be deny
american_official say that instead venezuela have not follow normal procedure in submit its request to enter american airspace and that washington have grant it anyway
a state_department statement say that venezuela have make the request on_wednesday just a day_before mr._maduro 's schedule departure when such request be suppose_to be make three day in advance
official also say that mr._maduro be fly in a cubana airlines jet and that diplomatic flight request be suppose_to involve official state aircraft
the statement say that despite all of that the united_states have work with venezuelan official to get the approval do quickly
this whole thing be absurd ms. jacobson say
this be a request that come in very late for an aircraft that be not a venezuelan state aircraft and therefore would not normally get diplomatic clearance and we get it do as quickly as we could so we do_not understand this reaction
but venezuela treat the flight request as a major international incident
mr._maduro say the united_states have deny permission to use american airspace and say the united_states have make a serious mistake
mr. jaua say it be an aggression against venezuela
the dispute fit a pattern of recent incident in which venezuela a major oil supplier to the united_states have grab onto seemingly innocuous comment or action by american_official that it then seek to turn_into major confrontation
mr._maduro have increase verbal attack against the united_states since he be elect in_april to replace the country_'s longtime socialist president hugo chã¡vez portray washington as an imperialist aggressor intent on undermine his government
in the end however the permission be grant and mr._maduro say in a twitter post just before 10_p.m. that he be depart for china
it be not clear however what route the plane take or if it pass over puerto rico which be a commonwealth of the united_states
it be also unclear why venezuelan official choose that route
the first leg of mr._maduro 's flight take him from caracas to paris an official_say
robert w. mann jr. an airline industry analyst in port washington n.y. say that the most direct route from caracas to paris be over the less antilles and that fly over puerto rico which be farther north add about 100 mile to the flight path
he say that there could be valid reason to travel the extra distance include wind forecast or technical issue associate_with the type_of aircraft be use
but he suggest another_reason
it could also have be a sharp stick in the eye he say
and give some of the personality involve that '_always possible
the dust up be use by other south american government to lash out at the united_states

sea_ice in the arctic ocean undergo a sharp recovery this_year from the record_low level of 2012 with 50_percent more ice survive the summer melt season scientist say friday
it be the large one year increase in arctic ice since satellite tracking begin in 1978
the expert add however that much of the ice remain thin and slushy a far cry from the thick arctic pack ice of the past
because thin ice be subject to rapid future melting the scientist say this_year 's recovery be unlikely to portend any change in the relentless long_term decline of arctic sea_ice
i_'m not at all surprised there be a jump upward we have never set two record_low in a row say walt meier a nasa scientist who have monitor sea_ice for year
i would say i be a little surprised the jump be as big as it be
last_year 's ice extent be so low that this_year 's recovery look large by comparison dr. meier say
the main reason for this_year 's growth dr. meier add be that the region be cold and cloudy through the spring and summer than in the recent past
we have cool condition cooler than the long_term average and yet it be still go to be the sixth low ice minimum on record dr. meier say
play out over a generation the decline of the arctic ice cap have be one of the most striking effect of global warming a change in the planetary aspect so large it would have be visible to an observer on the moon
we could be look_at summer with essentially no sea_ice on the arctic ocean only a few decade from now say mark serreze director of the national snow and ice data center in boulder colo. in a statement
contrary to popular impression the melting of sea_ice do_not cause a rise of sea_level since the ice be already float and displace its weight in water
but the replacement of white ice with dark water do mean the surface of the arctic ocean can absorb far_more heat in the summer which could contribute to the melting of nearby land ice in greenland raise sea_level
during the winter the arctic plunge into near darkness 24_hour a day and a skin of ice grow across most of the ocean surface
but during the summer the sun shin continuously
the key to the status of the ice cap be how_much of it survive the summer melt season to become thick resilient ice
when satellite monitoring begin in the late_1970 about half the surface of the arctic ocean would be cover by ice at the end of the melt season which usually occur in september
by last_year that figure have fall to 24 percent of the ocean surface rise this_year to 36 percent
the national snow and ice data center announce friday that the low point in sea_ice this_year have occur on_sept. 13
the timing vary from year to year and the agency always wait several day_before make an announcement to be certain the ice pack have begin to regrow
lately a new low in summer sea_ice have be set every few_year follow by a few_year of recovery follow by yet_another low that typically exceed the previous one by a substantial margin
bad homburg germany europe have barely be mention in the german election_campaign
but in the final day_before sunday 's vote a fringe party that want_to scrap the euro be gain in the poll threaten to scramble the country_'s consensus politics with a message that have echo of the tea_party in america and rightist movement elsewhere in europe
chancellor_angela merkel_'s christian_democrats be expect to emerge victorious from the election
but poll be give the upstart party alternative for germany a decent chance of win seat in parliament for the first_time
its surprising strength could have an outsize effect on the shape of the next german government and help determine how far it can go in satisfy the desire among its european_union partner for more forceful step to end the continent 's economic_crisis
a small but committed minority of germans see the party as the only alternative to mainstream party too timid to admit that the euro have fail
and the party have offer a home to more socially conservative germans who be unhappy with the way ms._merkel have push the conservative bloc to the center on social issue like gay_right
in recent day there have be a sense of euphoria among alternative for germany_'s supporter about its chance of win a share of power
i be convinced they will get into the bundestag say ingrid cook 63 who_live in bad pyrmont in northwestern germany and translate technical manual for a machinery company
mrs. cook say friday that she have be hand out leaflet and work at party information stand in her area
i have grandchild and i_want to be_able to tell them i_saw the catastrophe come and try_to do something about it she_say by_telephone
alternative for germany be poise to drain vote from ms._merkel 's party and its junior partner in government the free democratic_party enough perhaps to prevent the free_democrats from reach the 5_percent of the national vote need to return to parliament
such a result would leave ms._merkel no alternative but an awkward coalition with her main opponent the center leave social_democrats
while alternative for germany would be too small to have much sway over policy it could be a loud and disruptive voice in debate about measure to prevent the collapse of the euro offer a rightist challenge to the determine centrism ms._merkel have pursue in her eight_year as chancellor

in the past_few week the party have understand the need to expand beyond their image as a single issue party and position themselves as an alternative for people_who be socially conservative and no_longer feel the christian democratic union represent them say oskar niedermayer a political scientist at the free university of berlin
alternative for germany be decidedly a work in progress attract an eclectic group of supporter who seem to be unite only by their conviction that the mainstream party be not discuss the issue important to them
it remain to be see whether the party can become a lasting force in german politics in the same_way that the green party emerge_from the environmental movement in the 1980 or whether like so_many other issue drive party in the past it will self destruct amid squabble over doctrine and leadership post

not too long from now karl lagerfeld will pass a milestone in fashion
he will have spend 50 year at fendi design its fun fur and cerebral ready to wear
mr. lagerfeld have not exactly spend a half century look out a single window
he work for chanel too
and lately he have be slap his name on product at a do or die rate
at_least one part_of his brain remain by design slow and analog in its thinking with broad excursion to the past
and it_' this part i suspect that keep him root in one place for so long
but the other part be highly alert and reactive constantly move toward new idea and devour them
with good reason he have be compare to a shark
whatever account for this vital mix of the comfortable and the hard wire mr. lagerfeld keep re energize himself
with fendi more_than chanel he like the idea of digital technology this_season he use word like informatics and hyperlinked to describe the modular design of the clothes as_well as the grid pattern
it_' very possible that he do_not have a clue what these term mean
but the language and imagery of the web give him an idea and that ' what he react to
in truth if_you want a better think picture for the opening dress in the fendi show dress in overlap panel of laser cut fluorescent pastel organza it would be james turrell 's light sculpture in the guggenheim rotunda with its graduate and minimally compose hue
mr. lagerfeld be obviously limit by the surface and function of a dress
he also be keen to apply fendi 's skill especially with fur to his visual statement about light pattern and color
and light must mean weightlessness as_well
he achieve this harmony throughout the show but you see it most vividly in the opening organza dress and those in which the grid pattern be do with shave fur mount on organza
typically they be do in three slightly different pattern in three solid color with the organza allow light to pass through
in his review of the turrell show peter schjeldahl of the new yorker note_that this kind_of installation trump a trend among contemporary artist favor by art institution toward clamorous hysterically clever spectacle and performance
well fashion be insanely clever at the moment too_many novel fabric and crash color on what amount to conventional shape
and since designer have to knock_out new collection every few_month the subtle do_not get traction
plus you need someone_who can work as hard and think as fast as mr. lagerfeld
the prada show be definitely a big spectacle
that ' what editor and buyer have come to expect from miuccia prada
i_love her spring man 's show in_june if only because her creepy paradise theme make me wonder_if she be slyly reference the novel of michel houellebecq
her woman 's show the other night feel a bit stingy in spite of the saturated color and the bobblehead blowup of illustration on dress which mirror those on the wall of the prada show space
for the presentation the company invite four muralist and two illustrator to create work around the theme of femininity power and multiplicity
accord_to prada the concept originate from an interest in political wall art from mexico
in one sense the exuberant energy of the artwork it be do with the artist work together in the space be repeat in the clothes
but in another sense it feel as if the energy and spirit of feminine power be simply be mimic in the overloaded design with shape and fabric from prada 's archive
the most compelling design be sleeveless shift in viscose knit that evoke athletic wear the model wear soccer sock with sport sandal
they project an air of physical strength that most woman can relate to
but if ms. prada be broadly make a case for feminine power it be hard to see why she include cheerleader skirt and dress with bra design
my assumption be she know young_woman will think they_'re cute
at gucci frida giannini combine active wear style like track pant and flow beach tunic with art nouveau pattern inspire_by erte
it be an interesting idea and it help to soften up the brand
but i keep wonder where one be mean to wear these clothes with their black mesh bra and stream tie they look too exposed for the city
a yacht
a modern apartment tower in shanghai
you need some imagination which i_guess be not a bad_thing
today in italy maxmara 's neominimalist pencil skirt in pearl beige linen with match cashmere sweater or etch look denim separate in plain tonal design the press note allude to a robert ryman monochrome painting look almost mod
they be not out of step with the time
on the contrary they seem a buffer
with so_many dressy clothes on the runway one start to long for a simple summer dress
italian sportswear seem almost extinct
tod 's have hire alessandra facchinetti who start her career at prada to create sportswear and accessory
she make a small start on_friday but it be excellent
there be lovely shirtdress in rust and pale pink cotton with a gather across the back a relaxed pantsuit in powder blue cotton distinctive leather and a jaunty version_of the tod 's moccasin
donatella versace 's collection be populist luxury to the hilt a mere skip in her skyscraper platform and print flare skirt and bustier or mesh silk short with a ruched crinkle up the rear to the country_'s tv personality
this too be not a bad_thing
because with all her brawny instinct ms. versace be just react to her world

he preside_over the trial and early one morning in_2006 in a drab room in a former military intelligence building mr._haddad read mr. hussein the execution order and then accompany him to the gallows
since_then life for mr._haddad who as a shiite and a kurd be doubly oppress under a dictatorship that be dominate by a sunni arab elite have take on an unlikely trajectory
he be now in a private law practice have be push out of the judiciary like so_many qualified civil_servant by the shiite dominate government and replace he say by political party hack
he have carve_out a late career niche and a new measure of fame defend countless sunnis jail on what he and human_right activist say be spurious terrorism charge
i use to be a hero for the kurds and the shiites he say because of his role in mr. hussein 's trial
now i be a hero for the sunnis
he have also get rich
i have become a millionaire he say immodestly and then tick off the locale in which he say he own home beirut dubai barcelona germany
last_week i buy a big house in holland he say

he say he would purchase it in baghdad and have it send north
as he speak he remember that he be due in beirut in a few_day to try_to sell a property there because he be worry_that the war in syria will drive down real_estate price
he call in an_assistant and pull from his pocket a roll of $_100 bill peel off a few and tell the young_man to buy a plane ticket to beirut
mr._haddad 's story tell two truth of modern iraq the exile of educate technocrat from government service in favor of the patronage appointment of party align official who bend to the will of a powerful prime_minister and the vast wealth that be available to the well connect in a society where the majority of citizen live in abject poverty
with violence in iraq increase the government have respond with some of its harsh crackdown yet on sunni area cast a wide net in pursuit of terrorism suspect arrest the innocent and guilty alike
which be good_news of course for mr._haddad whose business be booming
he say his phone be constantly ring with call come in from anbar mosul and tikrit sunni area_where young_man be fill the jail
through mr._haddad 's effort abu hussein a sunni police_officer in samarra be recently release from jail after be hold for a year on terrorism charge that he say be false and make by an anonymous informer
that be standard practice here
many iraqis some of whom use to fee tip to the american_military in exchange for money now earn a living inform on their neighbor
the problem say human_right activist and iraqi official be that the information be often false
after his arrest a friend tell abu hussein about mr._haddad
they say he be the one who defend the innocent people he recall
the iraqi law be protect those informer but never the innocent people
he continue he be a shiite man but he defend the sunnis
he know_what be right and wrong and sect be not important

jerusalem this_month mark 20_year since the signing of the first of the oslo accords between the state of israel and the palestine liberation organization
two_decade after yitzhak rabin and yasir arafat stand on the white_house lawn with president_bill clinton israelis and palestinians be again in the midst of the umpteenth round of negotiation
despite these effort true peace seem as distant as it do before the secret talk in oslo be reveal to the world
the government of israel must admit that we make a mistake and declare that the oslo process have fail
only by officially annul the oslo accords will we have the opportunity to rethink the exist paradigm and hopefully lay the foundation for a more realistic modus vivendi between the jews and arabs of this region
despite attempt_to rewrite recent history by fringe element the failure of the oslo framework can_not be attribute to a lack of will and persistence by israel
what do_not we try
we attempt direct negotiation third party mediator public conference and back channel talk
we stag withdrawal and unilateral disengagement establish joint israeli palestinian military patrol in gaza and deploy american train security_force in the west_bank
none of this work
the p.l.o. and later the palestinian authority never truly accept that israel as the national state and homeland of the jewish people be here to stay
no amount_of impressive ceremony cosmetic change to the p.l.o. charter and palestinian doublespeak to western medium outlet about their commitment to peace be_able to change this grim fact
to understand the mind boggle scope of oslo 's failure it be best to look_at the statistic
accord_to the organization b'tselem during the first palestinian intifada in 1987 six_year before mr. rabin 's attempt_to recast the archterrorist yasir arafat as a peacemaker 160 israelis be murder in palestinian terror attack
in the mid- to late-1990 as successive israeli government negotiate with the palestinians and mr. arafat and his crony repeatedly swear they be do their utmost to end terrorism 240 israelis be brutally kill as suicide bomb and other heinous terrorist act target unarmed civilian be unleash in every corner of our nation
thing do_not get better after prime_minister ehud barak make the palestinians an offer in 2000 that judge by his landslide defeat in the election a few_month later be way beyond what most israelis support
between then and september 2010 1,083 israelis be murder by palestinian terrorist
the oslo process do_not bring peace it bring increase bloodshed
we_must end this farce by announce the immediate suspension of the accord
little impact would be feel by average israelis and palestinians
those_who would suffer most would be full_time negotiator like martin s. indyk and saeb erekat who would find_themselves out of a job after 20_year of gainful employment in the peace process industry
what should replace oslo 's false promise
we_should implement what i have call a three state_solution
in the future the final status of the palestinians will be determine in a regional agreement involve jordan and egypt when the latter have be restabilized
all the region 's state must participate_in the process of create a long_term solution for the palestinian problem
in the short_term the palestinians will_continue to have autonomy over their civilian life while israel remain in charge of security throughout judea and samaria commonly refer_to as the west_bank
follow an initial period the arab resident of judea and samaria could continue to develop their society as part_of an agreement involve israel and jordan
similarly gaza resident could work with israel and egypt to create a society that grant them full civil authority over their life in a manner that be acceptable to all side
most veteran of the peace process will mock this proposal protest that there be no way it would be accept by the palestinians
their argument may_seem convincing today but as i often remind my critic our region be unpredictable
have you tell any middle_east expert five_year ago that two successive egyptian president would be depose and bashar_al assad 's regime would be in the midst of a bloody civil_war you too would have be mock
thing change
we can make them change
i be aware that even_if the palestinians accept this plan we would still have to deal_with a fundamentalist hamas regime in gaza and continue instability in egypt
no plan for israeli arab peace can be fully implement until these issue be resolve
in the short_term israel 's only option be to manage this conflict by refuse_to compromise when it come to the security of israeli citizen
at the same_time our government should take all step possible to improve the economic well_being of the palestinians
the dissolution of the oslo accords would serve_as the official act validate what_we already know that this fail framework be totally irrelevant in 2013
once the palestinians be ready to sit_down and seriously discuss how our two people through this new paradigm could live side by side in peace and prosperity they would find willing partner across the political spectrum in israel
it may not be the utopian peace promise to all of us on that sunny day in september 1993 but in the harsh reality of the middle_east this may be the best we can hope for and the sole realistic chance for our child to grow_up in a world less violent than previous generation have have to endure

jacksonville fla. to measure the popularity and financial heft of the n.f.l. one need only look_at the record amount pay for franchise the league 's ever rise television rating and the astronomical price for super_bowl ticket
but one of the pure link can be find in the vast distribution center own by fanatic the nation_'s large online seller of licensed sport merchandise
on the monday after the league 's opening weekend worker here scramble to unload trailer fill_with everything from cap and jersey to shoot glass and doormat
half a football field away picker troll the aisle with scanner and cart to collect the good order overnight by fan across the country
merchandise carry the brand of the denver broncos the dallas cowboys the miami dolphins and the new_orleans saints all team that win their opener be among the most_popular item be drop into plastic box and send by conveyor belt to sorter who match the order
packer then put the merchandise in bag or box and send them to be load onto trailer destine for the airport
the day_after n.f.l. kickoff be a fanatics moment say dennis matthews who run the 520,000-square foot building and bring in 75 extra worker that monday the start of a busy season that run_through christmas
the moment be also one of the clear distillation of the willingness of fan to spend money to celebrate their team
it_' the bedrock of the business of fanatics which not only operate the online shop of the n.f.l. but also those of major_league baseball the n.b.a. the n.h.l. nascar the pga_tour and more_than 150 college and pro team
fanatic 's success be base_on fast access_to more_than one million item for professional and college team conference and league
the importance of n.f.l. sale to that business be a sign of the pre eminence of the country_'s large league in the licensed sport good market which generate about_$ 15 billion in sale a year
most licensed sport gear be still sell through traditional brick and mortar outlet
but those store also typically sell bat ball run shoe ice hockey skate and other gear leave them limit space for the jersey shirt and hat of even local team
often they stock only those of the most_popular player
fanatic by_contrast sell good for every player and team in every size and design
that mean a fan of say the seattle seahawks who_live in miami can get a marshawn lynch jersey deliver to the front_door as easily as a georgia bulldogs fan in texas can get a beer mug
fan can also find good for instant sensation like jeremy lin colin kaepernick and yasiel puig
emotion come and go quickly in sport so we_need to give fan what they want say michael rubin the principal owner and executive chairman of fanatics
these so_call displace fan make the bulk of the 15 million order that fanatics ship last_year
the company however be eager_to expand beyond them to meet an_ambitious goal of generate at_least $_5 billion in annual revenue over the next decade from $_1 billion this_year
the goal be audacious give that the revenue from licensed sport merchandise grow by only 2.2 percent last_year and be still 17 percent below its_peak in_2006 accord_to the international licensing industry merchandisers association
when the recession hit there be less disposable income and consumer be worried_about gotta have instead of want_to have say marty brochstein the senior_vice president for industry relation and information at the association
the licensed product market do_not go against consumer trend
still brochstein say that more_than other retail item licensed sport merchandise be well suited to online shopping because many fan follow team in city far from where they live
young consumer be also more comfortable spend money on the internet so over time the share of online sale should grow a boon to fanatics he say 1_2 next_page
i know you_'re worried_about the government shut_down on_oct. 1
who would not be
service suspend the nation_'s credibility damage in the eye of the rest of the world
what serious person would want_to let that happen
hehehehe
the better to plan your watchful worry here ' a tentative schedule of event monday sept. 23 senate go into session to consider the house bill that couple fund for the government with defunding obamacare
house be on vacation
i be serious
wednesday sept._25 house come_back from vacation
early
so stop carp
thursday sept._26 senate be work its way toward a vote on the bill
whoop
somebody just object to something
may take a little while longer
friday sept._27
the house take up a bill to raise the debt_ceiling thus allow the government to continue pay its bill
which be tie to defunding obamacare and construction of the keystone xl pipeline
saturday sept._28
the entire planet say keystone pipeline
sunday sept._29 maybe a day or two before but around here the senate strip the obamacare part from the bill fund the government pass the bill and send it back to the house
sept._30
last minute
clock be tick
oct._1
best case scenario the house pass the bill in the wee small hour of the morning
everyone breathe a sigh of relief and move on to the question of whether the government 's ability_to pay its debt should hinge on the construction of an oil pipe to the gulf coast
one thing at a time
about keep the government run in the end it will all be up to the house_republicans pass a clean bill or dig in their heel and turn_off the light
at that point house_republicans must stand firm hold their ground and continue to listen_to the american people say senator ted cruz of texas
house leader be less_than thrilled with his advice
it be sort_of like a guy who leave the alamo at the last minute yell victory or death as he gallop out of sight
some people believe_that cruz be behind everything crazy go on in washington right_now
this be possibly true if_you work under the reasonable assumption that everything that happen in the world be base_on a movie plot
the calgarian candidate
during the bush_administration agent of the democratic_party hatch a long_term plot to ensure political ascendancy in the 21st_century
their secret tool a canadian bear texas lawyer who they kidnap and brainwash
the mole we will call him t. suddenly emerge out of political obscurity in 2012 propel into the u.s. senate by member of the texas republican_party who have also be secretly hypnotize by the democratic operative
the only sign of their transformation be a compulsion to say t. be the kind brave warm most wonderful human be i have ever know in my_life over and over again
by the next_year democrat decide they want_to force the congressional republicans to behave with breathtaking irresponsibility
time to pull the trigger
while t. be stand alone at a washington costume party he be approach by a beautiful woman dress as the second amendment
and then
actually the house_republicans have plenty_of tea_party patriot who be perfectly capable of be crazy all by themselves
representative ted yoho of florida tell the times 's ashley parker and jonathan weisman that he be ready to stick to his gun it only take one with passion look_at rosa parks lech walesa martin luther king
i be mention this partly_because it be not often you hear someone equate eliminate health_insurance for the poor with rosa parks
also because i like to write representative ted yoho
the bill the house send to the senate on_friday do_not even make much sense
the defund obamacare part look as though it be write by squirrel
if it become law obamacare would actually continue to exist
at most the administration would be cripple in their early effort to get young uninsured americans to sign up for health coverage
this would presumably give the opposition more time to run those ad that show a young_woman be give a pelvic exam by a monster uncle sam doll
and meanwhile the popular children_'s health_insurance program would be throw into chaos as_well as payment to doctor who treat medicare patient
but what the heck
no sacrifice be too great when the cause be convince young_adult that they should not buy health coverage
it_' an_intense moment even by current political standard
when the republicans meet in conference on_friday politico report representative mike kelly of pennsylvania compare john boehner to jesus i do_not want this to be like palm sunday where we bring the speaker in on a little donkey and then next friday we crucify him
i know i be have a hard time get the image out of my mind too

atlanta steve stricker cut his pga_tour play schedule nearly in half this_year so he could be a more attentive husband and father and he find that a balanced life be worth pursue
in 12 tour start stricker 46 play well enough to qualify_for the season end 30-man tour_championship
the average number of start in 2013 by the other player in the field who do_not divide their time between north america and europe be 24
stricker 's family value and fan outreach make him a pga_tour commissioner 's dream but his stellar performance on a par down schedule be not_necessarily ideal for the tour chief tim finchem
if stricker who be tie for seventh place after 36 hole at east_lake golf_club end_up win the tour_championship and collect the $_10 million bonus after play in roughly one out of every three tournament win none and skip one of the first three playoff event what be to keep other star from turn their career into season long cameo
if 40 player would do it i would not like that finchem say
but that ' not go to happen
he probably have no cause to fret
stricker say i_'ve talk to a few player this_year that have ask_me a thing or two about my schedule and what i have be do and how come i come_out and still play at a fairly high_level at time
you_know there_' some guy i_think that think_about it
and do it for me be the hard part
i_think about it for a_lot of year
but actually do it be another step
brandt snedeker the defend fedex_cup champion look_at stricker as an anomaly and not a trendsetter
there_' maybe three or four guy that can do that out here he say make_clear he be not one of them
steve can put the club away for three week come_out and play great snedeker say
i_'m a guy that kind_of play into form
i need to be out here and play in competition and work myself into form that way
i can_not seem to get the same kind_of focus at home practicing
stricker 's one piece swing work to his advantage because it be easy to repeat even after a long layoff
it be like rid a bicycle whereas a swing with many move part be more like rid a unicycle
he have no hand in his golf swing snedeker say no hand in his putting
to thrive while play a part time schedule it help to have grow_up in a climate where the season provide build in break
the wisconsin bear stricker say we do_not play all year round so it_' like i_feel like i need to get away_from it at time
the primary factor in stricker 's decision be that he have two school age child both daughter who be grow_up while he be go
five other player in the field have school age child include the divorce dad tiger_woods who work his 16 tour start this_year around visit with his daughter and son
matt kuchar have two boy who be still young enough to travel with him on the tour
as they grow old he say he could envision follow stricker 's lead
if it come down to it and i need to spend_more time with family
yeah i could absolutely kuchar say
i_think that ' the scenario that i can envision adopt that sort_of schedule
since the start of the 2010 season stricker have miss one cut the 2012 players championship
his history of consistency be cite as another_reason he be one of the few player who could thrive while play less
stricker be one of six player in this_week 's field who do_not miss a cut on tour this_year
the others be kuchar woods sergio garcã­a jason day and adam scott
stricker can_not separate the consistency in his professional life from the constancy in his personal life
he say i_'ve get a good balance in my_life
i be happy with what i be do
i be comfortable with the decision i have make along the way and that go a_lot
when you_'re off the course life be in good shape make thing a little_bit easy to do out here on the road
i have be a little_bit easy on myself
i come_out fresher
i come_out with a better attitude
i be excited to be at each and every tournament
i_think that ' be good
ultimately decide on a schedule be like decide on a club
if not fully commit to the choice the result be often regrettable
you have to believe a limited schedule be what ' right for you say jim furyk by way of explain_why at age 43 with two school age child a repeatable swing a cold weather background consistent result and financial security he can_not see himself play a dozen event a year any time soon
i_think strick be at the point he know_what be right for him so he find a way to be very competitive at 12 event furyk say where if_you say in your mind i really should be play 20 but i be go to play 12 it do_not work
furyk who have 22 tour start this_year add i_think the guy be interested_in what he ' do
they_'re kind_of jealous because he ' play so well do so
what i admire be not the fact_that he ' play 12 event but that he kind_of figure_out what be best for his_family and go ahead and do it

the weekend broadcast of all thing consider be head west
at an underutilized npr office here the famed afternoon program will reboot itself on_saturday with a new host arun rath a new time zone and even a rearrangement of its brassy theme music
npr official have bill it as a rare chance for a legacy radio program previously base in washington with the rest of the public radio organization to rethink what it be and do and let listener decide if the change sound good
the timing be somewhat awkward since npr be try_to balance its budget by cut about 10_percent of its work force initially through voluntary buyout and if_necessary through layoff
the plan announce last_week have be demoralize for some employee but the show must go on include weekend all thing consider for which mr. rath be hire away_from the pbs program frontline in_july
for npr all thing consider be one of its two flagship the other be morning edition
npr say about 12_million people hear at_least a part_of the weekday program on a typical week 2 million hear the short weekend program
guy raz be the host of the one hour weekend edition until the end of last_year when he move over to the ted radio hour
while jacki lyden and others fill in npr executive talk at length about how to adjust the show over the long_term
geographic diversity be very_important to us say ellen mcdonnell npr 's executive editor of news programming
hurricane_sandy focus our attention on how we would broadcast if there be a situation where we be incapacitate at our washington facility
brainstorming begin and after a few meeting we agree that move the show west be central to our editorial and future business continuity
these be not_entirely new thought for npr.
the organization open the cavernous facility it call npr west in 2002 and for a while originate two program from here include day to day a well regard newsmagazine
but the program be cancel amid a round of budget cutback in 2008 and 2009
npr west have remain home to the organization 's southern_california bureau and to a number of morning edition staff_member include that program 's co host renee montagne but the move of weekend all thing consider have bring more energy
it_' good to be out west say mr. rath who have yet to unpack all the box in his new office
we 'll have more story from the west more voice from the west he say
but the core value of the program be not go to change
kevin roderick the founder and editor of l.a. observed which cover the city 's medium and politics say i_'m always a little wary when a national news outlet say it_' go to flavor its usual fare with more l.a. or west_coast perspective
the result tend_to be disappointing or at_least underwhelming
but it_' good for npr to strive for more outside washington sensibility and the people involve understand the turf so in that sense i_think it_' a plus for the weekend show to be base here
delay and defund
and default
that be the house_republicans brilliant plan in their last ditch effort to block implementation of the affordable_care act
it be a plan that threaten to grind the government to a halt and wreak havoc on the economy
if_they can_not take_over washington they will shut it down
it_' their way or no way
all or nothing
this be what have become of a party hijack by zealot
it would be tempting to blame all republicans for this absurdity but that would be unfair
there be still republicans who be interested_in good governance but they_'re be drag to the nether region of nonsensical policy make by young more ideological member of congress many from safely gerrymandered district that form virtual echo chamber of irrationality
the old guard have warn against the recklessness of the tactic of far_right house_republicans
john_mccain tell cnn on_thursday in the united_states senate we will not repeal or defund obamacare
we will not
and to think we can be not rational
senator richard burr republican of north_carolina say of the house_republicans strategy of threaten a government_shutdown to force the defunding of obamacare i_think it_' the dumb idea i have ever_hear of
senator jim risch republican of idaho have say there be not anybody that think that obamacare be go to get defunded
it can_not happen
he_add it be as impossible as anything can possibly be in washington d.c.
even karl rove strike a rational tone in a wall_street journal op_ed publish online wednesday_evening say any strategy to repeal delay or replace the law must have a credible chance of succeed or affect broad public_opinion positively
the defunding strategy do_n't
go down that road would strengthen the president while alienate independent
it be an ill conceive tactic and republicans should reject it
but all those plea seem to have fall on deaf ear or at_least defiant one
on_friday house_republicans and two democrats pass a spending resolution that would cut all funding for the health_care law
this bill have no chance of pass in the senate but that be not the point
the point be to gum up the work and to force vulnerable democrats in heavily red state to go on record as refuse_to defund the health_care law
these republican be not afraid the law will fail as much as they_'re afraid that it will succeed and become part_of the fabric of the collective conscience and bad yet be a clear legacy victory for president_obama
there be no more bitter tea_party loss than a perceive obama victory
the president be the focal point of the party 's frustration
tea_party representative have be send to washington with a singular mission obstruct obama
these kamikaze member of congress have make the house of representative a house of horror where smart thinking be smother where rabble demand respect
these be member of congress from district where the distrust of the federal_government and the distaste for this president be blind
some of them twist poll result to buttress their bitterness
they point to poll show that most americans oppose the law as fuel for their fight
what they neglect to reveal be that a sizable portion of those_who oppose the law do so because_they do_not think it go far enough not because it go too far
a may cnn/orc poll find that 43 percent of americans favor the law while 54 percent oppose it
but it also find that of those poll 16 percent oppose the law because_they think that it be not liberal enough
put another way 59 percent of americans support the law or want it to be more liberal
furthermore a poll_release this_week by the pew research center find that of the 53 percent of americans who say they disapprove of the law the percentage who want elect official who oppose the law to try_to make it work as_well as possible be large than the percentage who want them to try_to make it fail
the american people be not on the far_right 's side in battle
house_republicans be on a quixotic mission
sometimes in a fight you just have to know when your opponent have get the better of you limp home and live to fight another day
but the house_republicans prefer a twist last stand view face sure defeat in a blaze of glory and be remember for stand_up for what you believe in
if only their stance be honorable
there be no glory in this
this be petty and small
this be vindictive and vainglorious
this be what the end of seriousness look_like

thursday be quite the day for jpmorgan chase and its chief_executive jamie dimon
in the morning the bank agree to pay $ 920 million to four regulatory body to settle charge that arise out of the infamous london_whale trade of 2012 which have_already cost the country_'s big bank some $ 6 billion in loss
then in the afternoon the office of the controller of the currency the primary regulator of federally charter bank and the consumer financial protection bureau a relatively new regulator announce that jpmorgan would pay fine of $_80 million plus $ 309 million in restitution for sell credit_card customer bogus service
that ' $ 1.3 billion in fine and restitution in a one day not to mention strongly word statement by regulator an admission of wrongdoing by jpmorgan and promise by a humble dimon to do better
how in the world do we get from there to here
there be five_year ago when financial cataclysm threaten and jpmorgan be the one institution that avoid the misstep that bring low so_many others
it be herald as the best manage bank with dimon the best chief_executive
now that same bank run by that same man have become a piã±ata for government regulator even with thursday 's settlement there be still a half_dozen investigation under_way
let_me suggest a few possible reason the bank be never as_well manage at it appear
on one level jpmorgan raise the broad question of whether any of the big sprawl systemically important bank can truly be manage
but there be also issue that be particular to jpmorgan
the fact_that the london_whale trade be be mark differently by two area of the bank suggest_that something be seriously awry
ditto the investigation regulator open last september result in a cease and desist order a few_month later into whether jpmorgan have appropriate safeguard against money laundering
that kind_of compliance be part_of the blocking and tackling of the banking business
only now be the bank hire thousand_of compliance officer who should have be in place year_ago
unlucky timing
american banker ask an interesting question the other day what would have happen if the london_whale trade have take_place in_2009 rather_than 2012
almost_certainly the government 's response would not have be nearly as severe
the reason be simple say the newspaper
the government then be more worried_about harm the system and do_not want_to potentially upset market by assess large fine
another_reason though be that jpmorgan for all its trouble remain immensely profitable and huge with well over $ 2 trillion in asset
the government can make an example out of it without jeopardize it
the regulator be finally get serious
yes it_' true despite point_out numerous lapse by senior management at jpmorgan the government once_again name no name of senior executive and indict two relatively_small fry for their action in the london_whale trade
the regulator still have a way to go though they be unusually candid in describe the lapse by the top executive of jpmorgan
but look how far they have come
what one hear be that there be very little negotiating about the size of the whopping fine
and the securities and exchange commission require an admission of guilt as part_of the settlement which be a very big deal
let_'s pause and doff our cap to jed rakoff the federal_judge who first start complain_about settlement that do_not acknowledge guilt and whose reasoning appear to have persuade the s.e.c.
the passage of time have allow the regulator to get their act together say my_friend dan alpert managing partner at westwood capital and the author of the come book the age of oversupply
it_' encouraging for_instance to see the office of the comptroller of the currency shed its former reputation as the bank best_friend in washington and get tough on the institution it oversee
it_' important to remember why bank be regulate so closely
it_' not about punishment or satisfaction
it_' about ensure_that the bank be be run soundly
bank be not like other company a big bank failure can have enormous economic consequence as we saw in 2008
i_think the key to safe and sound banking be to hold the board and senior management accountable say karen petrou the manage partner of federal financial analytics
this be first_time of which i be aware it_' be do
she add largely because so_much else go unpunished jpmorgan end_up hold the bag
but better late than never petrou say
a little while ago i be browse craigslist during one of my many daily break from writing
every sentence or so i have to do something else
i be not a craigslist frequenter and i be not_entirely sure where to look so i type in writer and look_at the daily job posting

because i know nothing about craigslist i call my_son who be 26
take a chance he say
my husband say go and so do most of my_friend except one who raise the question of kidnapping
do anyone kidnap poet
not for money certainly
we try_to think of all the possible swindle that this could be and come_up with none
still it be hard not to be nervous or suspicious
not to wonder_what be actually go on
who river and whisper be
whether any of the other poet would show
i have no way of find out
the friday of the dinner a warm new_york summer day where the city move in slow motion it be hard to think of anything_else besides river and whisper and poem
at 4:30 dress in what i hop be a suitably poetic outfit a long dress that make me look as though i could write more_than one good poem i meet my husband for a drink at the half king an appropriately literary bar near the dinner destination
friend texted me advice which be more or less universal put your husband on speed dial just in case
but just in case of what be impossible to say
in front of the modern glass building expensive and impose stand two other poet easily recognizable
one a beautiful very young blond woman be wear a diaphanous skirt
the other a man_who look_like a good natured salesman wear a dinner_party suit
nervously we introduce ourselves
the building be one of those space that redefine the color white by be even more white than seem possible
we enter an elevator that go right to the third floor where we be greet by a tall blond woman who have a clipboard
she do_not say enter but she could have
the room be modern and overly bright
if it be possible to have too_much daylight this room do
the space be small and well staffed with server and helper of various kind and a bar full of enough champagne for us all to drink more_than a bottle or two
poet begin drink immediately and attentive server make_sure that we be never without a full glass
a long table hold enough finger food to serve three time our number
we find out quickly with the help of the clipboard woman that river and whisper be two
we be all informed that we be never to know their real name
their anonymity be this contest 's only rule
river a nervous asian man in a t_shirt walk_around to greet us with whisper a thin attractive white woman much tall than river
river be small and jumpy
whisper hold_onto him tenaciously
whisper be both quiet and bold
they walk through the room to greet all of us in a shy tentative way emphasize that their anonymity be as important as the poem themselves
whisper would stop suddenly seize with unexpected passion and feel the need to lean over and kiss river in a way that be hard for us nervous poet to ignore
i_'m just crazy about river be more or less all she_say 1_2 next_page
early in the morning of may 11 1987 someone smash through the glass door of the museum of modern art in stockholm remove a matisse from a wall and flee
all it take be daring and a sledgehammer
the whereabouts of the painting le jardin remain a mystery until the work be find last_year and make a celebratory trip home in_january
but law_enforcement play no role
the return be facilitate by the art loss register a london base company that over the last two_decade have evolve_into a little notice but increasingly integral part_of art investigation around the world
the brainchild of julian radcliffe an oxford educate former risk consultant who speak of once spy for british intelligence the register help fill a gap void billion of dollar worth of art be steal every year accord_to an f.b.i. estimate but law_enforcement have too few resource to prioritize find it
for mr. radcliffe whose other company help recover steal construction equipment this present a natural opportunity
since it begin 22 year_ago the register have develop one of the most extensive database of steal art in the world enable it to recover more_than $ 250 million worth of art earn fee from insurer and theft victim
along the way the company have draw criticism from those_who say its hardball tactic push ethical and sometimes legal boundary
even so the register continue to count law_enforcement agent among its supporter
to me they_'re very_important a very useful tool say mark fishstein the new_york city police_department 's art cop
mr. radcliffe 's company operate in the dim recess of the art_world where the prevalence of theft fakery and work of murky provenance have give rise to many business that promise to help client navigate this lucrative but largely unregulated market
but for the register despite its official sounding name and pivotal role as a monitor profit have not come easily and the company 's future look increasingly cloudy threaten a core player in the recovery of steal art
mr. radcliffe say that he hop the registry will break even this_year but that it have lose money for the last six and have stay afloat only thanks to his cash infusion
now the company be lose talent too
during the past year two key employee resign additionally the company 's general_counsel christopher a. marinello who have be as much a public face of the company as mr. radcliffe say he be leave at the end of this_month with plan to start a rival business
among the incident that have draw criticism the register mislead a client who want_to check the provenance of a painting before he purchase it tell_him it be not steal when in fact it be so that he would buy it and unwittingly help the company collect a fee for its retrieval
it have be know to pay middleman and informer for lead on steal work a practice that trouble some in law_enforcement who say that it can incite theft
and the company often behave like a bounty hunter charge fee of as much as 20_percent of a work 's value for its return
these fee do_not bother the insurance company and other client that hire the register to find a work
but the company have approach people and museum with whom it have no relationship
in several case people say the register contact them tell them of a lead on a steal work then refuse_to divulge any information until the subject agree to pay a fee
official at the musee des beaux arts in orleans france for_example say that the register approach the museum in 2003 assert that it have information_about an alfred sisley painting that have be steal from the museum
the company say it could retrieve the work if the museum agree to its fee
unable_to afford the payment the museum call the police instead
the work be never recover
sometimes we have to deal_with the fact_that under french law we could charge them say corinne chartrelle the deputy for a french law_enforcement unit that track steal art
she be not involve in the orleans case but say she know of similar instance where the register have try_to leverage its knowledge to extract a fee
they be keep information to themselves she_say 1_2 3_4 next_page
a rancher in brazil_'s amazon have be sentence to 30 year in prison for order the 2005 killing of an american nun and environmental activist dorothy stang
the rancher vitalmiro bastos de moura 43 be declare guilty just before midnight on_thursday the court in para state say in a statement
sister dorothy 73 be shoot six time outside the town of anapu where she work as an advocate for landless peasant often criticize cattle rancher for seize land illegally and destroy the rain forest

the use of biological marker like fingerprint face and iris to identify people be rapidly move from science fiction to reality
apple 's late iphone which go on sale this_week can be unlock with a fingerprint
user of android smartphones can unlock their device with a glance
and the department of homeland security be develop facial recognition technology that would allow it to pinpoint criminal and suspect in large crowd of people with closed circuit camera
once so expensive that it be use only by the military or high_tech company biometric technology have become so commonplace that even some school and hospital be use it
its adoption could make sensitive information more secure than conventional identification_card or password which can be easily forget lose or hack
but it also have the potential to undermine privacy which have be greatly compromise by recent revelation about government surveillance of phone and internet communication
in fact biometrics be not as safe as be often think
a 2010 report_from the national research council conclude_that such system be inherently fallible because_they identify people within certain degree of certainty and because biological marker be relatively easy to copy
for_example people leave their fingerprint on everything they touch which make those fingerprint available to any determine spy or law_enforcement agent
expert have show that fingerprint and other marker can be copy give hacker and thief access_to private information
and once compromise fingerprint can_not be reset like password or replace like passport
if proper safeguard be not put in place the use of some biometrics like facial recognition technology can also be use to conduct intrusive surveillance of individual or group of people by government and private company
use facial recognition software to match database of photo with image from security camera in public space and private building can help law_enforcement agency spot and track dangerous criminal
but the same technology can just as easily be abuse to target political activist or protester
retailer could use such system to snoop on their customer shopping behavior so that they could later target specific ad and offer to those customer
facebook already use software to determine whether photo that user upload to the site contain the image of their friend though the company do let user opt out of the system
even as the use of such technology have expand rapidly there have be little public debate about its use
most federal and state law do_not directly address the collection and use of biological marker by business and the government
some lawmaker like senator al franken democrat of minnesota have ask government agency and company like apple and facebook to explain_how they use biometrics
but congress must do more by enact legislation that govern how this technology be use to make_sure it do_not compromise privacy right

the official add in the immediate aftermath there be always a_lot of hearsay
some say they overhear this or that
but there be no requirement that something have to provoke him

no harm do haul it around may have harm stenson 's score

form have hold to a degree
stenson of sweden and scott of australia pull into east_lake golf_club rank second and third in cup point each tantalizingly close to the $_10 million bonus that go to its winner

scott who will be pair with stenson on_saturday for the second straight round express confidence enough in my_own striking to not be intimidate by henrik 's good ball striking

have agree this_week to pay $ 920 million in fine to resolve federal and international investigation_into its $ 6 billion london_whale trading loss jpmorgan chase have reportedly reach some closure in the case and be ready in the word of its chief_executive jamie dimon to move_forward in a process of simplify the bank
while jpmorgan may feel some closure there be scant closure for the american public which deserve accountability for bank recklessness that continue to endanger the economy and which understand that without accountability true financial reform be impossible
under the settlement jpmorgan will pay fine that amount to very little for a bank that earn $ 6.5 billion in the last quarter alone
it have also admit to violate security law on corporate governance and internal control
the securities and exchange commission rightly extract the admission as a condition of settlement
but unless federal_prosecutor follow up with charge_against the bank or its officer under the sarbanes oxley accounting law or other federal statute those concession be mostly an embarrassment
they be not in themselves punishment for past improper conduct and be unlikely to deter future bad behavior
the bank have escape more serious charge of lie to investor and regulator evidence of which be present in an earlier congressional investigation and be even broach in the settlement narrative of event with regulator make reference to senior management withhold information from the bank 's board and from regulator
if board_member and regulator be mislead it stand to reason that investor be also wrongly keep in the dark
as for the senior management no action be take against any individual and no executive be name in the settlement
but five be identify by title some of whom be still at the bank include the former chief_financial officer who be now a vice_chairman and mr. dimon
the s.e.c. as_well as federal_prosecutor and the f.b.i. in manhattan be reportedly still investigate the loss
unfortunately their record in pursue big bank and top banker be poor
mr. dimon say this_year that he exhort the bank 's executive and manager to be forthcoming and diligent in face up to the london_whale loss as they come to light
that response miss the point executive have to be hold responsible_for the disastrous result that arise out of bad management
the london_whale settlement open the door to the possibility of other investigation that can lead to real accountability but whether regulator and prosecutor will follow through remain a question

jim crace who ' on the 2013 man_booker shortlist of finalist for his novel harvest say the new parameter would offer a great overview of english_language literature but would also result in a less focused prize

with a huge lead and the rival skipper jimmy spithill swear at the helm of oracle_team usa 's yacht emirates team new_zealand look as if it have finally manage to end a decade of frustration and collective soul search to bring the america_'s cup back to the island nation where sailor be superstar
no such luck
instead it turn_into yet_another day on san_francisco bay that stretch the limit of credulity and the kiwis patience and end with them still yes still need just one victory to win the auld mug
they lead 8 3
it be tough enough at this stage to beat the improve oracle_team which be gain in speed and confidence but the need to beat oracle and the bay area wind deities be make the task even harder
at_least one race be postpone because of too_much wind on_tuesday wednesday and thursday
but friday 's obstacle be too little wind and although team new_zealand be ahead by close to a mile at one late stage the race that would have win them the cup be abandon with their ac72 near the penultimate mark because it have exceed the 40-minute time limit
it_' better to be lucky than good be not it say ben ainslie oracle 's tactician
we be obviously star down the barrel of defeat
when the race be stop the kiwis be perhaps less_than three minute of sail time away_from the finish and a national celebration
but like gatsby and the green light at the end of daisy 's dock they be leave star across the water
it_' obviously tough on the guy they put a_lot into the race say dean barker team new_zealand 's soft spoken skipper and helmsman
we be not think_about the time limit until we realize in that second downwind leg that it be go to become an issue
i_think it_' about be_able to put it behind you
you_can cry or you_can laugh and get on with it
and we do
we get back into it
so they do with barker and the kiwis hold off the ultra aggressive spithill to win the start in the next race and then round the first mark with a slight lead
but the rest of this wind shift mood shift race day belong_to oracle
the american team take the lead farther down the leg after use its starboard advantage to get a penalty on team new_zealand as the two big ac72 jibed and race official rule that team new_zealand still out in front do_not leave oracle quite enough room to cross unencumbered
at the bottom mark oracle outwit and outmaneuver the kiwis again round with a 20-second advantage and then build on it during the upwind leg and finally cross the finish line 1 minute 24 second in front and just to be clear on a muddle of a day well within the 40-minute time limit at 27 minute and 20 second
i_'m speechless and it_' hard for me to be speechless say ken read the former america_'s cup helmsman of the kiwis
i can_not feel bad for these_guy
time limit be a staple of sailboat racing and america_'s cup race be call off for exceed the time in 1977 and 1983
but bob fisher an america_'s cup historian from britain say there have never be a race call off with a team need just one victory to win
fisher term the 40-minute time limit a bit ridiculous
it be a bit low for a light air race around that track he say of san_francisco bay
they be do at time 20 knot and plus and if_they could_not finish in that it do_not give them much of a break do it
iain murray the regatta director and former america_'s cup sailor say that the team have unanimously agree to the 40-minute limit last_year which barker acknowledge through the pain
it would have be nice to have another 10_minute barker say
look today be a very unusual day on san_francisco bay
i_think it_' the first_time we have sail out there when it_' be that light all day
so i_think with all the thought on timing and to get two race in a day to do that in a set time to work around tv and thing it need to have a definitive end so that you could actually guarantee you would be_able to get two race
as barker speak in the postrace news_conference spithill as usual be sit_next to him
they be talented two in a generation helmsman from the southern hemisphere spithill be from australia but they be also longtime rival and disparate personality
spithill be more outspoken direct and openly combative barker more understated
team new_zealand dominate the early stage of this regatta take an 8 1 lead on_wednesday
but oracle have win two in a row and though the kiwis remain heavy favorite spithill be take every public opportunity to remind barker that the momentum be shift
we_'re in a battle now and honestly we both want_to kill each_other and that ' sport and that ' battle he say
i_think we have both get a_lot of respect for each_other and it_' one hell of a fight
ask to rank the aggression level on a scale of 1 to 10 barker answer 12
spithill answer 12 15 20
it_' just full throttle for us
we do_not have an option
los_angeles california be challenge the historic status of american citizenship with measure to permit noncitizen to sit on jury and monitor poll for election in which they can_not vote and to open the practice of law even to those here illegally
it be the leading edge of a national trend that include grant driver license and in state tuition to illegal immigrant in some state and that suggest legal residency could evolve_into an appealing option should immigration legislation fail to produce a path to citizenship
with 3.5 million noncitizen who be legal permanent resident in california some view the change as an acknowledgment of who be live here and the need to require some public_service of them
but the new law raise profound question_about which right and responsibility rightly belong_to citizen over resident
what be more basic to our society than be_able to judge your fellow citizen ask jessica a. levinson a professor_at loyola law_school refer_to jury service
we_'re absolutely go to the bedrock of thing here and stretch what_we use to think of as limit
one new state law allow legal permanent resident to monitor poll during election help translate instruction and offer other assistance to vote citizen
and immigrant who be bring into the country illegally by their parent will be_able to practice law here something no other state allow
in many way the new measure underscore the lock democrats have over the state capitol where they hold an overwhelming majority in both house
gov. jerry brown a democrat sign the poll worker legislation this_month and have indicate his approval of the other bill
many of the change include grant driver license to unauthorized immigrant pass with overwhelming support and the backing of several republicans
state_legislature across the country approve a host of new immigrant friendly measure this_year a striking change from just three_year ago when many state appear poise to follow arizona 's lead to enact strict law aim_at curb illegal immigration
more_than a dozen state now grant illegal immigrant in state college tuition and nine state and the district of columbia also allow them to obtain driver license
with an_estimate 2.5 million illegal immigrant live in california more_than in any_other state in the country some say the state have no choice but to find additional way to integrate immigrant
it_' a recognition that how people be live and work in their community may trump their formal legal status say hiroshi motomura an immigration law professor_at the university of california los_angeles
there be an argument that in part_of california a jury without a legal permanent resident be not really a jury of peer
some view citizenship as the final consecration of complete integration but this say let_'s take who we have and get them to participate_in our civil institution
early this_month the state supreme_court suggest during a hearing that lawmaker could create a law to address the case of sergio garcia who be bring to the united_states illegally as a child
mr. garcia have meet every other requirement to become a licensed lawyer
within day legislation be approve to allow immigrant who be bring here illegally as minor to obtain law license with just three oppose vote
but the bill to allow noncitizen to sit on jury have prove more controversial
several newspaper editorial have urge mr. brown to veto it
rocky chã¡vez a republican assemblyman from northern san_diego county say that allow noncitizen to serve on a jury would make it hard to uphold american standard of law
what_we call domestic violence be appropriate in other country so the question become how do we enforce our own social norm mr. chã¡vez say
he_add that grant more privilege would weaken immigrant desire to become citizen
once we erase all_these distinction what ' next

washington the obama_administration 's potentially pathbreaking proposal for carbon_emission limit on new power_plant will face political and legal challenge from opponent who argue_that the technology need have not be close to be prove as the law require
the draft rule be announce on_friday at the national press club by gina mccarthy the administrator of the environmental_protection agency
but to protect industry from pie in the sky requirement current law limit what rule the agency can make
e.p.a. rule sometimes demand technological advancement but the goal that the agency establish have to be meet by technique that exist law describe as adequately demonstrate
the proposal_would limit new ga_fire power_plant to 1,000 pound of carbon_dioxide emission per_megawatt hour and new coal_plant to 1,100 pound of carbon_dioxide
industry official_say the average_advanced coal_plant currently emit about 1,800_pound of carbon_dioxide per_megawatt hour
a megawatt_hour be a little more_than a typical american household us in a month
once the rule be in place new plant would be require to capture carbon_dioxide from the smokestack and sequester it underground
official_say the regulation could be complete by the fall of 2014
but utility say law govern underground disposal be not write with carbon_dioxide in mind and sequestration be in a legal quagmire
three system of carbon_capture be in various stage of development
the most_common be to convert coal into a mixture of hydrogen carbon monoxide which in this context be a fuel not a pollutant and carbon_dioxide and to recover the carbon_dioxide at two different stage
another method demonstrate by the utility american electric_power in recent_year at its mountaineer plant in west virginia be to burn coal conventionally and use an ammonia process to grab the carbon_dioxide out of the flue ga
and if coal be burn in nearly pure oxygen the flue gas be nearly pure carbon_dioxide
in the last_few day ms._mccarthy have refer_to several early stage carbon_capture project as a sign that industry can build the need equipment
in testimony on_wednesday before the house energy and power subcommittee ms._mccarthy cite four such project
she tell_reporter on_friday that the draft rule be base_on technology that be already enter the market and be construct in plant today
but the four she refer_to in the committee hearing range_from under_construction to plan
none of them would sequester the carbon_dioxide and all would sell it
the close to opening be the southern company 's kemper county plant in mississippi which will convert coal to gas and then filter out some of the carbon_dioxide reduce_emission by about 65_percent
but the plant at $_5 billion be $_1 billion over budget
southern company say in a statement on_friday that the plant 's economics be peculiar to its location and not a national model
its capture carbon will be sell for use in the oil_field where it help force more oil to the surface
but most power_plant be not in area_where they can sell their carbon_dioxide
revis w. james director of the energy technology assessment center at the electric_power research institute say that before a technology could be consider commercially demonstrate you 'd need kemper to be operational and a couple more kempers and have the kink work out
carbon_capture and sequestration he say be unlikely to be competitive unless natural_ga price increase by 100 to 150 percent and the construction of nuclear plant be rule out
ms._mccarthy also refer_to three project that would sell carbon_dioxide to the oil industry a coal_plant in saskatoon saskatchewan the boundary dam project where the provincial utility plan to rebuild a small 45-year old unit to capture carbon_dioxide the texas clean energy project 15 mile west of odessa where the builder hope to soon break ground and hydrogen energy california propose for the oil_field of kern county
as the price of oil have rise so have the value of carbon_dioxide to oil drillers
the value as a carbon reduction mechanism be unclear though because the result be to produce more oil all of which will be burn produce more carbon_emission
e.p.a. official_say that a carbon_emission rule would push improvement in the technology
two_decade ago when the agency require technology to reduce_emission of a different pollutant nitrogen oxide a smog precursor that too be expensive and not thoroughly demonstrate but today it be routine they say
the big carbon_capture project to date be at the american electric_power 's mountaineer plant in new haven w.va
but nicholas k. akins the company 's chairman and chief_executive say that technology be definitely not ready for prime_time
mountaineer be a pilot project
equip the whole plant would have cost_$ 1_billion he say and drive up cost per kilowatt hour by 60 to 80_percent
the company eventually shut_down the effort because it could_not recover the cost from its customer
and injection of carbon_dioxide into the earth be only possible because it be classify as a research project he say
mr. akins and other industry executive say that a rule govern new coal_plant would have little impact because of the low price of natural_ga
no_one in their right mind be go to start a coal unit at this point he say
but they fear it will become a precedent for limit on exist plant
rule on smog mercury and other pollutant be accelerate the retirement of many old coal_plant and a rule on carbon_dioxide would hit many more they say
many of the environmental_group that applaud the e.p.a. 's propose standard appear to agree
they take pain to note_that coal_plant also emit a variety of smog form and toxic chemical and that suppress new plant because of their carbon_dioxide emission would have the effect of reduce the other emission too
on the other side senator mitch mcconnell who be from coal dependent kentucky promise to prevent the measure from be carry_out
the president 's decision today be an escalation of the war on coal he say

their target accord_to an american cybersecurity company that monitor the attack be the technology behind the united_states clear lead in military drone
i believe this be the large campaign we have see that have be focus_on drone technology say darien kindlund manager of threat intelligence at the company fireeye base in california
it seem to align pretty well with the focus of the chinese government to build up their_own drone technology capability
the hacking operation conduct_by a group call comment crew be one of the most_recent sign of the ambition of china 's drone development program
the government and military be strive to put china at the forefront of drone manufacturing for their_own use and for export and have make an all out push to gather domestic and international technology to support the program

china be now dispatch its_own drone into potential combat arena
every major arm manufacturer in china have a research center devote to drone accord_to chinese and foreign military analyst
those company have show off dozen of model to potential foreign buyer at international air show
chinese official this_month send a drone near dispute island administer by japan debate use a weaponize drone last_year to kill a criminal suspect in myanmar and sell homemade drone resemble the predator an american model to other country for less_than a million dollar each
meanwhile online photograph reveal a stealth combat drone the lijian or stealth sword in a runway test in may.
military analyst_say china have long try_to replicate foreign drone design
some chinese drone appear at recent air show have closely resemble foreign one
ian m. easton a military analyst at the project 2049 institute in virginia say cyberespionage be one tool in an extensive effort over year to purchase or develop drone domestically use all available technology foreign and domestic
chinese engineer and official have do reverse engineering study open source material and debrief american drone expert who attend conference and other meeting in china
this can save them year of design work and mistake mr. easton say
the chinese military have not release statistic on the size of its drone fleet but a taiwan defense_ministry report say that as of mid-2011 the chinese air_force alone have more_than 280 drone unit and analyst_say the other branch have thousand which mean china 's fleet count be second only to the 7,000 or so of the united_states
the military significance of china 's move into unmanned system be alarming say a 2012 report by the defense science board a pentagon advisory committee
china 's domestic security apparatus whose $ 124 billion official budget this_year be large than that of the military be also keenly interested_in drone which raise_question about the potential use of drone for surveillance and possibly even attack inside china include in restive area of xinjiang and tibet

the drone appear to be a bzk-005 a long range aircraft use by the chinese navy that make its public debut in_2006 at china 's air show in zhuhai say an american_official
mr. easton say deploy the drone near dispute water and island be very_much a first for china and have catch japanese official off guard
i_think this be really just the beginning of a much broad trend we_'re go to see for china to increase its ability_to monitor the east china sea and the western pacific beyond the philippines and to increase the operational envelope of their strike capability he say
the chinese military with its constant focus_on potential war over taiwan and an eye on china 's grow territorial dispute be at the vanguard of prepare drone for use in maritime situation
that be unlike the united_states which have use drone to hunt and kill suspect terrorist and guerrilla fighter mostly in pakistan and afghanistan
american drone be not design to enter into contest or deny air space mr. easton say
so they would be unable_to fight in any conflict with china
china on the other_hand be build drone also call unmanned aerial vehicle precisely to operate in contest space
it_' a very useful instrument for safeguard maritime sovereignty say xu guangyu a retire major general and director of the china arms control and disarmament association
china will gradually step up its use of u.a.v. 's in this area

less_than 4 percent of registered car run only on battery_power accord_to an analysis by the industry researcher edmunds.com of data from r.l. polk which record vehicle registration nationwide
hybrid which run on some combination of gasoline and battery_power account for 15.5 percent the data say but many of those be traditional hybrid which do_not require a plug in cord for recharge

california 's law to reduce pollution for_example require that 15.4 percent of automaker vehicle be power by alternative technology by 2025

the city offer free parking to any vehicle display the state issue sticker that allow access_to the car pool lane and the santa_monica city government have also make it easy for resident to install charger at home by waive electric permit fee and speed_up the approval process
we_'ve work to make it an over the counter process say dean kubani director of the city 's_office of sustainability and the environment
the city know as a surfing haven also have one of the strong environmental record in the nation
in 1982 it create one of the first municipal curbside recycling program and it have lead other california city in a ban on plastic bag at drugstore and supermarket
santa_monica have a long history of progressive politics mr. kubani say
it_' attract the type_of person_who tend_to support environmental policy

the 0_2 giants find a ray of hope this_week in the knowledge that their last such start come in 2007 when they sweep their next six game and go on to win super_bowl xlii.
the belief that they can repeat such a turnaround could hinge on how they fare sunday against quarterback cam newton and the carolina panthers an opponent they be meet at a familiar time and place
the giants travel to charlotte n.c. with a 1_1 record in their third regular_season game last_year
they use a 36 7 thumping of the panthers to start a torrid stretch in which they win five of six game
that help lead to a win record 9 7 but not a playoff berth
there have to be a sense of urgency defensive_end justin tuck say of this_year 's slow start because we be not get those two game back
any sense of dejã vu surround sunday 's kickoff in charlotte end for the giants with the absence of run_back andre brown
against the panthers on_sept. 20 2012 brown carry 20 time for 113 yard and 2 touchdown
he and the rest of the giants offense play the best possible defense against newton by keep him off the field the giants dominate the time of possession keep the ball for 36 minute 10 second
this_year brown be on injure reserve until mid november with a broken leave leg
the giants have miss his hard charge style
with their age offensive_line struggle to create run lane they have 33 rush attempt for 73 yard a meager 36.5 yard_per game
it appear the defense will also be lack a key figure cornerback corey webster be list as doubtful after miss friday 's practice with a hip injury
aaron ross be expect to make his first start for the giants since super_bowl xlvi to close the 2011 season

i_love to play
i_love to compete
i be a fierce competitor he say
any time i have a chance to go out there i be excited
ross draft by the giants in the first_round in 2007 say he have always be ready to rejoin the lineup

ross hurry into action in the season open 36 31 loss at the dallas cowboys when prince amukamara collide with safety ryan mundy and sustain a concussion
ross hold up well against tony romo the cowboys elusive passer
we_'re not look for any kind_of letdown safety antrel rolle say of the probable lineup change
we_'re look for ross to play ball as he do against dallas
no_matter the circumstance the giants express confidence they could defeat the panther if_they repeat the success they have last_year against newton the first player take in the 2011 draft and one of the game 's most dynamic player
the giants hold newton to 16-of-30 pass for 242 yard and intercept him three time
although newton be difficult to tackle at 6_foot 5 inch and 245 pound the giants limit his effectiveness as a ball carrier by take a double_digit lead
he rush six time for 6 yard include his team 's only touchdown
it come in the third_quarter after the visitor have build a 23 0 lead
it be a rare poor afternoon for newton who become the only player in n.f.l. history to pass for more_than 8,000 yard 8,045 and 40 touchdown 41 while run for more_than 1,000 yard 1,045 and 20 touchdown 22 in his first 33 game
he pass for 3,869 yard and rush for 741 yard and 8 touchdown last_year when he become the first quarterback to lead his team in rush since donovan mcnabb pace the philadelphia eagles in 2000
he be a special athlete mundy say
he can bring the ball down and get 5 yard or he can get 70 yard
although the giants have only two sack defensive_end mathias kiwanuka say he think they could turn up the pressure against newton
everybody know about his foot and when he escape the pocket that he can still look down the field and he can make people miss kiwanuka say
so our job will be to push the pocket get people up in his face and make_sure we get him down on the ground

vanderbeek a new_jersey native be the showy owner who get newark 's shiny prudential center build but nearly sink the devil into bankruptcy in the process
kovalchuk be the limitless offensive threat who help the devil reach the 2012 stanley cup final then return to his homeland 13 month_later

he score 89 goal after arrive in_february 2010 and he be second on the team in point last_season 31 despite miss 11 game with a shoulder injury
he have significant ice time include on special team and his mere presence create offensive opening for teammate
you_'re not go to go out in ufa and fill an ilya kovalchuk say devils forward ryane clowe refer_to unrestricted free agency
there be only so_many of those in the world
but couple kovalchuk 's departure with that of david clarkson and his 45 goal over the last two season and the devil be miss two of their top three scorer from a team that only score 112 goal and miss the playoff last_year
clarkson a toronto native bolt for a seven_year $ 36.75 million deal_with the maple leafs

he re sign center adam henrique to a 6-year $ 24 million deal
henrique and the top line center travis zajac be sign through 2018 19
lamoriello also add jaromir jagr the n.h.l. 's active leader in goal and clowe and michael ryder free_agent from newfoundland
ryder and clowe make their devils preseason debut in a 5_3 loss to the islanders on_thursday and have share time in practice on the same line
devil coach pete deboer acknowledge it be too early to set lineup but the notion of them play on the same line would excite some fan in eastern canada
that have not really happen before two guy from newfoundland play on the same team and the same line say clowe who play for the rangers after the trade deadline last_season
i_'m sure everyone back home would love to see it
the devil also sign the 27-year old forward damien brunner to a professional tryout monday
brunner be on the ice for three islanders goal thursday but he share time on the ice with the top forward zajac dainius zubrus and rostislav olesz
he play with elias in power play drill tuesday his first full day as a devil
it_' always nice to be part_of a new group and bring some energy say brunner who have 26 point for the detroit red wings last_season his first in the n.h.l. after star in his native switzerland
the devil be a first class organization you_can tell just be here
i hope it all turn_out well
the devil power play rank 21st last_season score on 15.9 percent of its chance
the team expect brunner to help improve that
he be also talented in shootout another area the devils hope to fix
they be 2 7 in shootout last_season
he can make some play when he have the puck on his stick deboer say
there_' a good chance something good be go to happen offensively
we could use a little_bit of that
the devil may have new face but they be not young face
ryder and clowe be in their 30 and jagr will be 42 in_february
injury have_already bite the devils forward
on the first day of training_camp last_week jagr leave the ice after 10_minute with what the team have call lower body soreness
he have not practice since though deboer say friday that jagr be skating and would return soon
clowe sustain a low body injury against the islanders and do_not practice friday
forward mattias tedenby 23 leave practice friday with a low body injury and do_not return
the devils play the islanders again saturday_night at barclays center in brooklyn for the first n.h.l. game at the arena which the islanders will call home start in 2015
still for someone like tedenby a former first_round pick who have play just 105 n.h.l. game over three season team with a slew of veteran forward be enormously beneficial
that in turn may be productive for the devil offense down the line
i_'m really excited to be around them and play with them tedenby say
it_' good for young guy like me who want_to get to their level

he be direct to a television monitor in the clubhouse that be broadcast andy_pettitte 's news_conference announce that he would retire at the end of the season
pettitte and manager joe_girardi be make assurance that the weekend festoon with farewell tribute would not be a distraction
the sideshow this time would not involve rodriguez and rodriguez do_not seem to notice the sideshow

with all the drama the pomp and the circumstance
after all the final nine game could be his valediction too

his grand_slam in the seventh_inning lift the yankees past the san_francisco giants 5 1 lift their faint postseason hop
the grand_slam be rodriguez 's 24th send_him past lou_gehrig for first place on the career list

we_'re really on a sprint to the end here and every win be huge for us
the day begin with the announcement of pettitte 's retirement which along_with the long await ceremony for mariano_rivera on_sunday and next_week create a tricky balancing act for the club
there be still very_important game to play
the yankees who seem to be constantly remind themselves not to look ahead can_not afford to lose focus look back
of course that vacuous middle ground be an uneasy backdrop for this final homestand straddle the belief that there will be postseason life and the reality that it may be now or never for goodbye
but if there be one yankee who seem unencumbered by reality or the notion of goodbye for that matter
it would be rodriguez
while he do_not know about pettitte he do know that he be in a 1-for-22 skid enter the game
i_'ve be miss ball hit high tower fly ball rodriguez say

it_' time to go starter c. c. sabathia say
we_need to try_to win out
sabathia do everything he could hold the giants to one run in seven plus inning
but san_francisco 's starter tim lincecum be just as effective even_if he be no_longer fire mid-90s fastball as he do in his prime
the giants have not visit the bronx since_2002 and lincecum have never before face the yankees
as a washington native he say he grow_up root for rodriguez when the rise star play for the mariners
at a young age it_' kind_of hard not to know about guy like that lincecum say
it be a little surreal

but he get in trouble in the seventh
eduardo nunez lead_off with a single to right and steal second base put himself into score position with one out
but the giants third baseman pablo sandoval make an impressive slide stop on a grounder down the line by j. r. murphy force nunez at third on lincecum 's 116th pitch
five pitch later lincecum walk ichiro suzuki load the base
giants manager bruce bochy bring in reliever george kontos to face rodriguez
on a 2_1 fastball rodriguez send his home_run out to right
it_' a huge hit girardi_say
i do_not know_how many more we can_afford to lose and we_'re in a very tight game with c. c. and lincecum a very_good matchup and we_need a big hit
said sabathia
it be vintage
it feel good to be_able to see him do that
that be a big moment
with such monumental importance on each game the timing of the pettitte announcement certainly complicated thing

girardi_say he do_not believe the additional hoopla and the buildup for sunday 's start would deter pettitte 's routine or the focus of his_teammate
that ' not what he want girardi_say before the game
we think it be important for him because andy understand_what the fan have mean to his life and his_family 's life and he want_to say thank_you
and we all think that this be the proper way

to which i say where ' the evidence_that physical proximity to one another help people work better or more creatively
and where ' the evidence_that professional be any less productive when they work at home
it_' time for more employer to take_advantage of modern_technology and allow telecommuting

for 12 year people in our company work from home office
for the last_year and a half most of us have be work out of an office in manhattan
this experience have convince me that people_who work collaboratively work more creatively more efficiently and more productively when in close proximity
some of our employee still work from home and i have notice that they_'re often about half a step out of sync with the rest of us because_they 're simply not in the flow of day to day operation
yes you_can get a great deal do by internet and conference call but not everything that transpire in a company be document in an_e mail or a phone_call
there_' all that in between stuff the stuff that happen between the idea and the delivery
moreover it_' difficult for an employer to ascertain the productivity of a worker who be not in the office
an employee work from home can run errand go to the gym or otherwise not do his or her work without the employer know it
a number of our remote employee have prove this to me over the year
and finally there_' the human factor
inflection mood and meaning be all much_more apparent in person than over the phone and certainly more_than in an_e mail
when it_' really important people will inevitably say we_should meet in person to discuss this
as far as i be concerned business be really important every_day so we_should meet in person every_day to conduct it

fairhope ala. judge from the question submit by the audience everyone attend the eastern shore republican women candidate forum share some basic assumption
how do one get_rid of obamacare
how badly do a break immigration policy hurt the district
what be the best way to roll back federal spending and intrusion into state issue
as for president_obama president_bashar al_assad of syria receive more kind word
but while the republicans run to represent alabama 's first congressional district be in agreement on the core message their style vary in some way jarringly
and the outcome of tuesday 's primary though likely_to be a function of turnout here may provide some hint on how_much further the republican shift to the right may go
there be a time when this primary would be automatic
the district which surround mobile bay be one of several in alabama to vote republican in 1964 when barry goldwater run for president and alabama be still a solidly democratic state
for the nearly five decade since it be represent by just three republican congressman the first two publicly designate their successor and all three inclined to effective deal make rather_than fiery rhetoric
the thing that make a congressman effective in the south be constituent service say sonny callahan who_represent the district in congress from 1985 to 2003
such a candidate in the past may have be bradley byrne 58 a former state_senator and the current front_runner or perhaps chad a. fincher 39 a two term state legislator from mobile 's conservative western suburb
but with no heir apparent for the first_time in 50 year the full spectrum of conservatism be on display from mr._byrne who speak sunnily of the country_'s ability_to overcome any of its current challenge to dean young a real_estate developer and tea_party favorite who describe the stake of the election in far_less optimistic term
we be witness the end of a western christian empire mr. young 49 say at the forum
the republican field quickly populate after representative jo bonner announce in may that he be step_down for a position with the university of alabama system the state democratic_party miss the filing deadline though the two democratic candidate be allow to run anyway
in_addition to mr._byrne mr. young and mr. fincher the field include wells griffith 31 a hometown boy make good who recently work at the republican national committee and whose supporter see him as a direct line to representative paul d. ryan and the other young prominent figure of the right and quin hillyer 49 a conservative journalist whose detailed policy analysis and list of endorsement testify to decade in the premier circle of the conservative movement
everyone expect a runoff and the runoff could include any of these
the only candidate assume to be a lock be mr._byrne the best finance and most widely know
mr._byrne whose political career and support from the business community have mark him as the establishment candidate be know statewide for a bruising race for governor in_2010
that republican_primary become a pitched battle between mr._byrne who have the broad backing of republican_leader and tim james a staunch conservative and son of a former governor
their fighting and a nasty scrap mr._byrne get into with the teacher union leave voter cold and open the way for another republican robert j. bentley a mild mannered dermatologist who now sit in the governor 's mansion
this recent lesson about the wisdom of let others do the attack perhaps explain_how well mannered this primary have be so_far
but negativity linger from the ad war in_2010 include perception that mr._byrne a democrat until 1997 be insufficiently conservative
he like the others support get_rid of the president 's health_care law and have even propose abolish the internal revenue service
but he talk repeatedly of spending on infrastructure and work with congressional democrats where possible
and cite a huge investment by the aircraft maker airbus that may transform mobile mr._byrne be surprisingly upbeat for a conservative running in these time
i_think people be concerned he say in an_interview at a campaign gathering for young professional many of them young_man with good haircut and press khaki
but people do_not want_to be angry
they want_to be hopeful
this may be an accurate read of the district
but in what be expect to be an election with very low turnout it remain to be see whether it be a good read of those at the poll
if not the beneficiary may be mr. young
mr. young who make a serious run at mr. bonner in 2012 and have finance much of his_own campaign this_year say he would vote against raise the debt_ceiling see those_who would compromise in congress as spineless and boast of support from chief_justice roy moore of the alabama supreme_court a hero among the hard right evangelicals who form mr. young 's base
supporter of the other candidate speak with a respectful and perhaps wary bewilderment about this base
its electoral behavior often elude pollster and competitor as chief_justice moore 's recent career illustrate
famed for instal a ten commandment monument in the state judicial building in 2003 chief_justice moore run for governor in_2010 and to the surprise of many receive less_than a fifth of the vote in the primary
two_year later he run for chief_justice and to the surprise of many win the primary without a runoff
if we get a 10_percent turnout who know_what be go to happen say lou campomenosi a political science professor_at tulane university who be involve in alabama 's tea_party movement
that '_why i_think dean become the real wild_card candidate because he ' get this really fervent group behind_him
an hour northeast of mobile mr. fincher be greet voter at a fair in atmore
in a condensed campaign mr. fincher 's name recognition be a considerable advantage and many believe_that he be likely_to meet mr._byrne in a runoff
at the fair mr. fincher talk of concern_about an out of control federal_government and a loss of christian value a message that resonate with people sit nearby and pick at barbecued rib
but concern just may not be a strong enough word
i_think barack obama be the bad_thing that ' ever happen to this country say stoney daw 72 a former federal law_enforcement officer and now a small_town police chief
i do_not know if we can survive three more year
columbus ohio if marian gaborik feel the pressure of carry a franchise 's hope he do_not show it
as he embark_on his first full season with the columbus blue_jackets there be no question that gaborik be the linchpin of the team 's offense
come off the weak of his dozen season in the n.h.l. he have big expectation to meet
that '_why i be here gaborik a three time all_star say of the weight of be the club 's no 1 offensive threat
at the same_time i_want to provide anything that it take to win game not just score
i_want to be an all around player and help the team in any way
he have score at_least 30 goal in a season seven time surpass 40 three time
last_season slow by a tear abdominal muscle he have only 12 goal in 47 game
he be acquire from the rangers at the trade deadline for forward derick brassard and derek dorsett and defenseman john moore
gaborik play well down the stretch as the blue_jackets go 19 5 5 and miss the playoff on a tiebreaker
people get catch_up in a certain year 's statistic just look over the guy 's whole career blue_jackets forward r. j. umberger say
i mean he score goal he ' do it since he start play hockey
sometimes guy go_through ups and down
he know_how to score and he will score a ton for us
the prevail opinion be that gaborik 31 have be too good for too long not to have a great season
he play that game where you may not notice him and then all of a sudden boom
he take off and it_' in the back of the net forward nick foligno say
that ' the kind_of elite player that he be
he ' so dynamic and play the game at such a high_level that even_if you try_to contain him he ' so hard to hold
the blue_jackets be build on hard work and the brick_wall in net provide by goaltender sergei bobrovsky last_season 's vezina trophy winner
they have a cadre of double figure goal scorer in brandon dubinsky artem anisimov mark letestu umberger foligno and the off_season free_agent signing nathan horton
they be also count on a group of young wing cam atkinson ryan johansen and matt calvert to provide an uptick on offense
still gaborik be probably the only player on the roster who would get the attention of an oppose defense
and the blue_jackets youngster seem awed by him
he ' an elite talent calvert say
the number of goal he ' put up in the league already be amazing
to have a guy like that to have that offensive ability when we do need that big goal in the last minute he get the puck on his tape after we find him and he ' go to put it in the back of the net
that '_always reassuring
gaborik almost begin his career in columbus
there be a coin flip before the 2000 draft to find out which of the two expansion franchise the blue_jackets or the minnesota wild would pick no
3 and which would go next
the blue_jackets with a history of bad trade bad team bad player and bad luck lose
gaborik go to the wild and the blue_jackets take defenseman rostislav klesla a serviceable journeyman on the blue line now with phoenix
gaborik develop into one of the most fear sniper in the league
he have 336 goal and 338 assist in 769 game
when the rangers make him available at the trade deadline general_manager jarmo kekalainen and the director of hockey operation john davidson jump at the chance
have a player like gaborik change us davidson say
always one of the fast skater in the league with one of the quick shot gaborik appear to be as quick as ever healthy and energize by his new surroundings
he know the offensive burden he carry
obviously scoring be go to be very_important he say but you_can not go out there think i have to score i have to score
you just have to focus_on other part_of the game as_well
the goal will come when you work hard and do your job
coach todd richards say he have like what he have see of gaborik in training_camp
i sense that he ' focus he ' ready to work richards say
and he ' ready to have a good season
this be the final year of gaborik 's contract
the blue_jackets say they want_to negotiate with him once the season begin
leave unsaid be that they want_to see if gaborik an occasionally laconic player be motivate to have a big season
it_' a big year for us and for myself as_well gaborik say
i_'m not think_about contract right_now
i will go out have fun enjoy myself play hard and thing will work out

when dr. john h. kennell be a hospital pediatrician in the 1950 newborn be typically whisk away within minute of delivery wash weigh blood test and plunk into bassinet under the nursery 's fluorescent light
their mother would not be permit to hold them for 12 hour sometimes longer
at university hospital in cleveland where dr._kennell be the staff neonatologist nurse bottle feed infant every four hour
mother could visit but not for very long
dr._kennell who die on_aug. 27_at 91 like to say that it be the full throated complaint_about this state of affair by his patient that lead him to undertake a research project in the 1960 that help change the world on which most newborn now open their eye
his finding publish in maternal infant bonding a 1976 book write with dr. marshall h. klaus a fellow professor of pediatric medicine at case western reserve university in cleveland be consider a prime catalyst for change in hospital procedure that give new mother more private time with their infant let father into the delivery room and allow young_child to visit new sibling in the hospital
the book 's central claim be that infant and their mother be hormonally prim in the first hour_after birth to form crucial bond but that under hospital rule then commonly observe that process be not allow to happen
baby be ready to eat right away after be bear but they do_not get to their mother for 12 hour dr._kennell say
no_one be pay_attention to what the baby want
the doctor idea be well receive by developmental psychologist who ascribe to attachment theory which link the relation newborn have with their first caregiver to their ability_to have healthy relationship in adulthood
relatively quickly bonding become widely adopt as part_of maternity ward routine
but maternal infant bonding come under severe criticism
fellow researcher say its conclusion be base_on too small a case sample and put too_much stock in the mother child interaction in the first hour
adoptive parent complain that the theory leave them out of the picture
some feminist saw it as just another way to place child rear responsibility solely on woman and to blame the mother if a child grow_up troubled
dr._kennell and dr. klaus acknowledge mistake in their finding and publish a revise version_of their book in 1982 parent infant bonding
though it stick to the original premise the new edition be less specific about a bonding timetable
the book have be update several_time since
in an introduction to the 1996 edition the noted pediatrician author dr. t. berry brazelton defend the author
despite criticism by some that proof of a sensitive period for bonding between parent and baby have not be show the author have continue to fight for a more humane atmosphere in hospital at the time of delivery dr. brazelton write include time for early attachment behavior between a new parent and baby
we now realize how important it be to create this atmosphere
the sea change in hospital childbirth practice draw on many social current of the 1960 and 70 include the natural childbirth movement the woman 's movement and an anti authoritarian climate say j. kevin nugent the director of the brazelton institute a child and family research center found by dr. brazelton at boston children_'s hospital
maternal infant bonding he say strike a chord with a broad cross section of woman many of them nurse and hospital administrator who be also mother and be receptive to the change it propose
hospital procedure be gear to the efficient running of hospital rather_than to the need of mother and baby dr. nugent add
john help change that
john hawks kennell be bear on jan. 9 1922 in reading pa. to doris hawks and carlyle kennell and grow_up in buffalo
his_mother be a high_school english teacher and his_father an insurance salesman
after medical_school at the university of rochester and two_year in the navy dr._kennell do his residency at_harvard medical_school
he be the chief resident at boston children_'s hospital before he move to cleveland in 1952 to teach at case western reserve and serve_as the attend pediatrician in the neonatal unit of the university hospital
dr._kennell who die in cleveland be survive_by his_wife margaret lloyd kennell a daughter susan two son david and john who confirm his_death and five grandchild
dr._kennell go on to study the bonding process from another perspective look_at parent of infant who die in delivery or soon_after be bear
he be one of the first neonatal expert to recommend that the grieve parent hold their newborn and his insight about the emotional benefit such physical contact can provide parent have be incorporate in the standard procedure of most neonatal intensive care unit
dr._kennell also become an advocate of doula train nonmedical professional who help woman during pregnancy labor and postpartum
with phyllis h. klaus and dr. klaus he write the doula book how a train labor companion can help you have a short easy and healthier birth publish in 2003 and now in its third printing
the great question of his work however be the mystery of the chemistry between child and parent
what be the process by which a father and mother become attach to an infant he ask in bonding a 1996 book he also write with the klauses
we have develop ever great respect for the complexity of the process
it be our continue quest
michael cuddyer have never hit .300 in a major_league season
a .271 career batter come into 2013 cuddyer an outfielder for the colorado rockies hit a career high .284 in_2006 with minnesota
the last time he hit high than .300 in a full season on any level be 2001 when as a 22-year old he hit .301 for class aa new britain
if_you include his 4-for-18 performance in a brief call up to the major that season his average drop to .298
all of that make it curious that cuddyer at 34 and in his 13th season lead a tight race for the national_league batting title with a .331 average enter saturday 's game
cuddyer be not the most surprising player in recent baseball history to lead the n.l. in hit
in 12 season and nearly 5,000 plate appearance he be well establish as a power hitter with a mod average but his ascension to the top of the batting leader be no more shocking than that of derrek lee a chicago cubs first_baseman who lead the n.l. with a .335 average in 2005 after hit .266 in his first eight season
what make a potential batting title for cuddyer interesting be that he be play for the rockies
once know for home_run help by denver 's thin air and know as the blake street bombers the rockies have actually be far_more dominant in term of batting title and that be something that no humidor have be_able to change
andres galarraga the first player to sign with the rockies get thing start right by post an n.l.-lead .370 average in 1993 the franchise 's inaugural season
he hit .243 for st._louis the season before
include galarraga a colorado batter have hit .330 or high 16 time lead to seven batting title
the rockies lead the major in those category since their inception
the yankees come close with a player bat .330 or better 11 time no other team be in double_digit
in term of batter who could be accuse of take_advantage of coors field cuddyer fit between jeffrey hammonds who have a home/road split of .399/.275 in 2000 and larry walker todd helton and matt holliday all of whom be excellent hitter in any park
help along by a .378 batting average on ball in play cuddyer be hit .347 at coors field enter the weekend and .318 on the road
the difference be not surprising because coors field have be the most conducive park in the major for hit in 2013 accord_to espn 's park factor rating just as it be in each of the last five season
for all the talk of humidors and revamp pitch staff make colorado no_longer a hitter 's haven no major_league park be better for raise batting average
cuddyer have also benefit_from a relatively weak field
he have a small lead over atlanta 's chris johnson another surprising name among the leader but his .331 average would have lead the league in only 15 of the previous 137 season
a stumble through july and august when cuddyer hit .287 in 167 at bat nearly sink his chance but he recover in september hit .404 in his first 15 game
if the race come down to the wire cuddyer will have to take_care of business on the road as the rockies finish the season with a three game series in los_angeles
a cuddyer batting title would come with many caveat but statistical outlier be part_of what make examine baseball 's record book fun
with a strong final week cuddyer could join tony gwynn rogers hornsby and honus wagner on the list of n.l. batting champion and that be worth pay_attention to
it be 2005 and brandon myers then a little use second year tight_end at iowa go home for a weekend in the off_season
home be prairie city iowa population 1,680 a hamlet with a grocery a convenience store a hardware center and no traffic light
myers drive five mile out of town down a dirt road next to cornfield and stop at the house where he grow_up with his parent an old sister and an ever change assortment of hog horse and sheep
i know brandon be come to tell_me that he be not go_back to college his_father dan myers say thursday
he be have a hard time
he think he be fail because he be not play and the coach be on him
they want him to change a_lot of thing
father and son say little throughout the weekend visit dan 's construction work site and the 200-acre family farm where brandon learn to drive a combine as a child
then on_sunday afternoon when myers be about to announce that he be not go_back to college his_father speak first
i tell_him that year from now he do_not want_to be that guy stand in a bar in a small iowa town tell everyone how he could have be a big time football player dan myers say
i say that his college coach be test him to see if he would quit or if he would fight back
it be a pretty emotional deal a turning point moment
sit alongside the giants practice field myers who be tie for the team lead in reception this_season also recall the 2005 conversation
my_dad tell_me not to give_up on the chance to be something special he say thursday
he say i be too young for that
what he do be talk me out of a mistake
myers return to campus and the football team 's intense off_season workout
there be a change in brandon say chris doyle iowa 's strength and conditioning coach
he have be a kid from a small_town in iowa try_to figure_out thing on a high more_complicated level
but when he commit himself fully we all saw the big time player we always think he could be
by his senior year myers be a first team all big ten selection and then a sixth round draft choice of the oakland raiders in_2009
that ' what parent be for right myers say with a smile
they help their kid when they need it most
after a breakout season with the struggle raiders in 2012 myers sign a one year free_agent contract hop he could become the late in a long succession of less known giants tight_end who have big role in the offense see jake ballard and kevin boss
with the giants talented wide_receiver hakeem nicks and victor cruz work the sideline route a tight_end have plenty_of room in the middle of the field to find open space
that be exactly where myers be in the second_quarter sunday during the giants game_against the denver broncos
eli manning toss a pas to myers who catch the ball near the denver 30 with no defender between him and the end zone
myers turn and begin to sprint
about the 20 he trip without be touch and topple to the turf
it be a jarring gaffe
a 45-yard touchdown have become a 27-yard gain a good outcome but not the one the giants who trail by 4 point need
if giants fan have not yet learn the new tight_end 's name they know by the end of that hard to watch play
i_'ve never ever do_anything like that in a game myers 28 say
inexcusable
to make matter bad on the next play as myers be run another pattern across the middle with his head turn toward manning denver safety duke ihenacho who have be beat on the previous play slam his shoulder pad into myers 's rib cage
the violent hit draw a penalty
myers get up slowly
three play later as myers stand at the 1 a high pas from manning zip through his raise hand
as the ball be elude his grasp he be drill in the rib again
myers lay on the field for several second before he wobble to his foot and all but stagger to the edge of the giants field goal formation
he be still waver in his stance as josh brown kick a field goal
myers who have six catch for 74 yard in the game have his rib wrap the next day
ask about the sequence of play and his injury myers shrug and say it_' a contact sport
it would have be a_lot better if i have not fall down

jerusalem small_group of jews be increasingly ascend the temple mount in jerusalem 's old city a sacred site control for century by muslims who see the visit as a provocation that could undermine the fragile peace_talk start this_summer
for decade the israelis draw to the site be mainly a fringe of hard core zealot but now more mainstream jews be line up to enter as a widen group of israeli politician and rabbi challenge the longstanding rule constrain jewish access and conduct
bride go on their wedding day synagogue and religious school group make regular outing and many surreptitiously skirt the ban on non muslim prayer like a russian immigrant who daily recite the morning liturgy in his mind as he do decade_ago in the soviet_union
palestinian leader say the new activity have create the bad tension in memory around the landmark al aksa mosque and dome of the rock and have call on muslims to defend the site from incursion
a spate of stone throw clash erupt this_month on_wednesday three muslims be arrest and an israeli police_officer wound in the face
and on_friday thousand_of arab citizen of israel rally in the north warning that al aksa be in danger
we reject these religious visit sheik ekrima sa'eed sabri who oversee muslim affair in jerusalem say in an_interview
our duty be to warn he_add
if_they want_to make peace in this region they should stay away_from al aksa
the 37-acre site be perhaps the most religiously contest place on_earth
jews revere it as the home of the first and second temples 2,000 year_ago
for muslims who call the site the noble sanctuary it be the world 's third holy spot from which muhammad be believe to have ascend to heaven
more_than 300,000 foreign tourist also flock there annually many of them christians draw to the ruin of the temple jesus attend
politically the compete claim to the area be the nut around which the israeli palestinian conflict revolve the symbolic heart of each side 's religious and historical attachment to jerusalem that have make its governance one of the thorny issue in peace negotiation
israel capture the site along_with the rest of east jerusalem and the west_bank in 1967 with a general declare dramatically the temple mount be in our hand
but the government immediately return control to the muslim authorities and ever_since a de facto accommodation have prevail in which muslims worship at al aksa above and jews at the western wall below a remnant of the retain wall around the ancient second temple
there have be flare ups before
in 2000 a visit by ariel sharon then israel 's opposition leader accompany_by 1,000 police_officer prompt a violent outbreak and many argue set_off the second intifada
over the last_few year a cause long take up by only a fringe group of far_right winger have increasingly be embrace by the modern orthodox know here as religious zionists who have also gain political power
at three recent parliament hearing religious lawmaker and cabinet minister question the status_quo in which non muslims can enter the site only for a few_hour five day a week and those identify by the police as jews be separate escort by police_officer and admonish not to dance sing bow down or even move their lip in prayer
the temple mount be in our hand but be it really
ask michael freund a jerusalem post columnist who visit the site as a child in 1977 and return for the first_time last_year with 50 member of his synagogue
it particularly offend me that the israeli government put into place restriction which prevent jews from fulfil their basic right to freedom of worship

florham park n.j. against the back wall of the jets equipment room hang a green no
82 jersey
it rest on a green hanger and dangle from a silver hook and it do_not belong_to mickey shuler or rob carpenter who wear that number with pride or for that matter to anyone on the current roster
this can be the source of much confusion
a year_ago when konrad reuland join the jets he wonder_why a no 45 jersey be drape in the same spot
three week pass before he ask
i_think maybe something happen reuland say
do someone pass away
be they honor somebody
be it a memorial
then i find out and i say oh that make_sense
the answer to reuland 's question can be find on a small plaque affix to the wall above the jersey
it celebrate the recipient of the bill hampton award present to the rookie who best exemplify a pro in the locker room"- like josh baker no 45 and hayden smith no 82 who to reuland 's relief remain very_much alive
the winner 's jersey hang for a year and in plain view of player mill about their locker
but the award name after hampton a beloved former equipment director who retire after the 2000 season have retain an air of mystery
the five member of the equipment staff who determine the winner by secret ballot do_not mention it to rookie unless they be ask
so_far only one defensive lineman sheldon richardson have
you get reward for act like a professional say richardson recall his reaction
should n't you just do that
in the eye of the equipment director gus granneman and his staff yes
ideally every rookie should comport himself like brad smith no
16 2006 who after practice would pick_up his_teammate discard sport drink bottle and deposit them in the trash
and ideally every rookie would have the awareness to pack the shoe best suit to that week 's playing surface instead of rely_on granneman or his assistant to do it for him
but that be not what_happen
as soon as rookie minicamp begin in may the staff start observe the contender
they notice if someone arrive in a suit or bookends his request with please and thank_you
they also notice if a player turn his helmet into a storage receptacle or treat his locker like a junkyard
it be not immediately know_how they feel about those player shoot wad up ball of athletic tape into trash can from across the room on_friday
midway_through the season the staff decide on the finalist
voting take_place in mid december which be also when the politicking tend_to begin
with a laugh granneman say that damon harrison last_year 's runner_up would call attention to his bag pack prowess
for much of the year though the player be not even aware that they be compete against one another
like many of his fellow rookie ryan spadola an undrafted receiver from lehigh have not even notice smith 's jersey hang in the equipment room let alone know the significance behind it
when tell spadola say it help him appreciate the high standard to which he say he hold himself as an n.f.l. player
everything be our responsibility at lehigh so you really have to take it upon yourself to hold yourself accountable spadola say
that ' how we be teach
for myself come here this be a great honor to have these_guy help us out but i still need to take_care of my area like it_' my little home or bedroom
cleanliness be only one of the criterion that granneman say he consider
attention to detail be important
so be politeness
a few rookie who be otherwise unaware of the hampton award offer their interpretation of what the equipment staff value
be accountable to your teammate richardson say
treat people and your equipment with dignity and respect offensive tackle oday aboushi say
a high maturity level because we all just come from college guard will campbell say
other equipment staff around the league no_doubt expect their player to act professionally but the jets appear to be the only one that honor them for it
of the 26 team that respond to an inquiry only one bestow a similar award the philadelphia eagles under andy reid honor the player not the rookie who exemplify professionalism
an eagles spokesman say in an_e mail that he do_not know whether the new coach chip kelly would continue the practice
when the jets relocate here from hempstead n.y. in 2008 granneman say that one of his first thought be where to put the jersey
the tradition informally date to 2002 when the equipment staff decide to reward a player who have show mark improvement over the course of the season
as a joke they give him a sweatshirt
but it occur to granneman to introduce a more formal award and he do so in 2004
erik coleman no 26
the nine previous winner range_from the sublime darrelle revis 2007 to the shifty danny woodhead 2008 to the sturdy matt slauson 2009 with the victory by slauson a guard buck precedent and conventional wisdom
if a lineman win it you_know he ' really go good granneman say
those guy by nature be not the neat
not many seem to have much stay power
it be the jets micro version_of the madden video_game curse or the sports illustrated cover jinx because the last three recipient john conner baker and smith be all out of the n.f.l. we have not have good luck predict long_term success with the jets granneman say
naturally that will not stop him from grant the award for a 10th consecutive season
granneman decline to handicap an early favorite but say there be plenty_of appealing candidate
we_'ve be watch he say
in the spring of the 1995 major_league baseball season a rookie name andy_pettitte be pitch in relief for the yankees
another rookie name mariano_rivera be start and not do well
eighteen year five world series title and one major_role reversal later they be move in tandem toward retirement
pettitte may start his last game ever at yankee_stadium on_sunday and rivera widely consider the best reliever ever also begin the final week of his major_league career unless the yankees somehow squeeze into the postseason
in 1995 the yankees do_not know_what they have in rivera
he be a skinny 25-year old from panama and in his major_league debut on may 23 he last only three and a third_inning in a game the yankees lose to the california angels by 10 0
in his next start at oakland he do better pitch into the sixth inning and give_up just one run as he notch his first major_league victory in a 4 1 yankees win
but nine day_later on june 6 in the bronx rivera make his third start again against the athletics and be pound give_up seven earn_run in four inning
another shabby outing by another young pitcher both homer come off starter mariano_rivera produce another exasperating yankee loss jack curry write for the new_york times
rivera he note be hit so hard by the a 's that he resemble their favorite batting practice pitcher
the day_after rivera be knock_out of that game leave the yankees with a 14 21 record it be the 22-year old pettitte 's turn
he have make his major_league debut nearly a month before rivera have in a brief relief stint april 29 against kansas_city and have make four more appearance out of the bullpen before manager buck showalter put him in the starting rotation
he last five and a third_inning against the a 's in oakland in his first start on may 27 a 3_0 loss
he pitch a complete game_against the angels at yankee_stadium on june 2 but lose again this time by 3 2
and now start no
3 against the same a 's team that have hammer rivera the day_before
pettitte go seven inning allow just one run and four hit and earn his first major_league victory as the yankees prevail 6 1
for one night pettitte be a savior of sort curry write in the times
he save the yankees from disappear even deeper in the american_league east standing save them from possibly be sweep by oakland and save them from another night of discontent by pitch wondrously
the rest be
well you_know the rest
pettitte who go 12 9 that first season now have 255 victory the most of any active pitcher
rivera who end_up make 10 start in 1995 and none after that have more save than any_other pitcher 652
and over the last two_decade he have close out 72 of pettitte 's victory
but for two day in_june 1995 it be the other way around with pettitte pick_up for rivera

team hop to bolster their pitching rotation this winter will have a final look_at most of their free_agent option this_week and all be hop for the kind_of success the los_angeles dodgers and the pittsburgh pirates have last off_season
ervin santana matt garza tim lincecum and ricky nolasco be among the player available but base_on last winter 's signing there be really only two choice for lure a productive free_agent starter from another team pay exorbitant price for a premium talent or pay almost nothing and hope for a turnaround
most other deal at_least last off_season disappointed edwin jackson and joe blanton dan haren and brandon mccarthy joe saunders and shaun marcum to name a few
at the top of the salary scale the dodgers lavish six_year and $ 147 million on zack greinke who be 15 3 with a 2.75 earn_run average for the national_league west champion
at the bottom the pirates pull_off the steal of the off_season snag francisco liriano for a guarantee of just $_1 million
liriano lead the pirates in win go 16 7 with an e.r.a. of 2.88 and the team be poise for its first win season since 1992 and almost_certainly a berth in the playoff
even after be name to the all_star team in_july jeff locke a fellow pirates leave hander call liriano the most_important part_of the team 's renaissance
liriano be that miss piece that kind_of put everything together locke say
frankie 's fun to watch
liriano 29 have be fun to watch before
he win 12 of 15 decision as a rookie for minnesota in_2006 and throw a no hitter for the twins in_2011
but he slip badly in 2012 go 6 12 with a 5.34 e.r.a. for the twins and the chicago white sox
the pirates who raise their payroll this_season but still hunt for bargain take an interest
i do_not know that we saw something that everybody else miss general_manager neal huntington say
we be willing_to take a chance
we saw a guy that if everything click have three above average major_league pitch the slider and the changeup for sure and the fastball if we could get him to command it a little_bit better
with the change in league with the change in ballpark with the change in team we think he could come over here and do a very nice job for us
the previous off_season the pirates have take a similar chance on a. j. burnett acquire him in a trade with the yankees
like liriano burnett have exceptional stuff but often struggle to harness it
in a new environment burnett flourish go 16 10 in 2012
he have tail off to 8 11 in 2013
the pirates and liriano originally agree to a two_year $ 12.75 million contract last off_season
but before he sign the deal liriano break his right nonthrowing arm in an accident at home
that slash the guarantee to just $_1 million
it essentially make it a make good deal huntington say that if he get healthy and stay healthy he have a chance to earn the money that he would have make
and he ' go out and he ' earn it
i can_not say enough good_thing about the man
despite miss the first month of the season liriano reach a career high in victory with 15 on_aug. 30
after that game he say he have change his approach since his young day
i_'m not try_to be a strikeout guy say liriano who still average roughly a strikeout an inning
early in my career i be go to try harder and blow people out
now i just try_to go deep in game
reduce his walk have probably help the most
in each of the last two season liriano average at_least five walk per nine inning
this_season help by a delivery in which he get his hand high over his head liriano have average about three and a half walk per nine
he ' become fearless with pound the strike zone huntington say
he still get a_lot of chase but he ' throw better quality strike than he have in the past
it be a choice of risk reward for us and we decide to go with the high risk/high reward guy because we feel_like if we hit we have a chance to really grab a very_good major_league pitcher and he deserve the credit

the pakistani foreign_ministry say it have release the commander mullah abdul ghani baradar a found member of the afghan taliban and a former deputy to the movement 's leader mullah muhammad omar in an effort to further facilitate the afghan reconciliation process
mr._baradar be capture in a joint operation by the c.i.a. and pakistani intelligence in the port_city of karachi in_2010 and his detention have be a point of contention among pakistan afghanistan and the united_states ever_since
wakil ahmad muttawakil a former taliban foreign_minister welcome mr._baradar 's release as a step toward peace_talk between the afghan_government and insurgent
but a taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid decline to comment say he be wait for direction from his superior
i can_not say anything until i receive something from our superior he say
i have be try_to get reaction all day
the release have be expect for several week
critic of such release who be most vocal in afghanistan point_out that mr._baradar have not publicly state whether he support peace negotiation or whether be willing_to play a role in talk
we have to be cautious and we_should not be overly optimistic about what be go to happen next say sayed mohammad amin tariq a member of afghanistan 's high peace council from badakhshan
we_should now see if mr._baradar can really help the peace process or whether he will rejoin the taliban and fight
a spokesman_for the high peace council maulavi shahzada shahid be more upbeat however call the release a good sign for the strengthening of the peace process between the taliban and the afghan_government

berlin it would be easy to mock the political campaign that end with sunday 's national election in germany as a version_of fiddle while rome burn
it have lack any heated debate_over the nation_'s role in maintain the common european currency or address the crippling level of unemployment among its southern neighbor
the clash over intervention in syria that consume the britain france russia and the united_states for week barely make a political ripple here underscore how deeply germans shun the use of force
chancellor_angela merkel_'s center right government and the left lean opposition remain largely united in support an_ambitious and costly plan to wean the economy off nuclear_power and carbon fuel
there be little talk of the demographic challenge of an age population
it be a showcase for the postwar german tendency toward consensus and be all the more remarkable for the contrast it provide to the bitter ideological clash play out in the united_states and many other big democracy
it could well yield an outcome almost unfathomable in peacetime washington paris or london a power sharing agreement_between the main party of the left and right
the relative comity between the major party on the campaign trail do_not mean that ms._merkel assume she emerge to lead the next government can escape tough choice or that germany can insulate itself from force beyond its control from the financial_market and the global economy to tumult in the middle_east and a russia that be try_to reassert itself
welcome by many germans as stability at a time of prosperity the mood may nonetheless disappoint germany_'s allies in the united_states who would love to see the country assert itself more in europe as_well as its partner in the european_union who just want_to end the bloc 's doldrums and look to germany for bold action
frustrating as it may be this germany of slow step and consensus politics be precisely the one that the united_states and its victorious european allies seek to forge in the smoldering ruin of world_war ii.
it be a structure that be reinforce as late as the country_'s reunification after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 when the old german question of how to tame the country_'s undoubted power be solve by wrap it still tight in the bond of a unify europe the very one be test today by a slow grind economic_crisis
it be also a system that have promote steady and farsighted vision on big issue
more_than in most western democracy german leader include ms._merkel who be seek a third_term have persuade their people to endure short_term pain for long_term gain whether reunification energy transformation or a decade_ago the kind_of labor and economic overhaul that other european nation be still blink at
we be the student very eager_to learn the american re education program say jã¼rgen falter 69 a professor_at the university of mainz and an expert both on the nazi past and germany_'s complex electoral system
and we have really fully internalize it we go for pacifism not belligerence consensus rather_than conflict
after 1945 the allies deliberately build a federal structure that disperse power from berlin and scatter national institution throughout what be then west germany
in_addition they devise an electoral law virtually guarantee to produce a coalition_government no chancellor since konrad adenauer in the late 1950 have be_able to govern alone
for proof take ms._merkel of the christian_democrats and her main rival peer_steinbrã¼ck of the social_democrats
numerous domestic and international observer have struggle to detect vibrancy in the back and forth between ms._merkel 's camp and mr._steinbrã¼ck 's over any range of issue child allowance for nonworking mother how best to preserve generally good and cheap health_care and even what berlin really intend for the 17-nation euro_zone or the 28-member european_union
the distinction in their position fall squarely into the two social grouping from which they spring the christian middle_class in the case of the christian_democrats and the working class and trade union for the social_democrats
the center left be more open about the possible need to raise tax give the impoverished state of germany_'s municipal and state coffer

q.
what be some important early lesson for you
a. i be bear in a very small_town in india and the literacy rate at the time be just one in six
thankfully one of the big thing my_parent could do for me be to recognize that if i stay in that town it would be very difficult to get out
and i remember learn_how my_parent decide that i have to leave
i be play marble and i have an exam the next day
my_mother say why be not you study for your exam
and i say what ' the point
i will be first anyway
i be not that bright but in that small_town i would have be first
so my_parent send me to the no 1 school in india which happen to be a boarding school in new delhi
it immediately change the game for me
i go from somebody who have never be second in class to the middle of the class
the bar be immediately raise and i have to work really hard
the lesson for me be that a very_important part_of leadership be to set a bar for people and to constantly keep them out of their comfort zone
i_think status_quo be a real enemy for progress
and get out of my_own comfort zone be just as important
q. any_other influence from your parent
a.
i ask my mom recently if she saw anything in my early childhood year that would tell her that there be something great in store for me
she tell a story of when i be pretty young and i have some medical problem
she take me to an ayurvedic doctor and he give_me a concoction that i have to put on my tongue rather_than swallow every_day
i would do it every_day and not complain
one day my mom try the medicine to see what it taste like
and she_say it be the most bitter awful medicine
when she be tell_me about this recently she_say i_think one of the thing about you be that you do_not complain_about something you have to do
and i_think this be a leadership lesson too
you have to swallow many bitter pill in your life
you just can_not keep complain_about how life should be
you have get to accept the way you have to run your life and then do the very best you_can
q. tell_me about your first career job
a. i come from a background of entrepreneur and after i get my m.b.a. i join a start up rather_than a big company
i find that to be a much_more exciting way of learning
i become an area sale manager for an electric typewriter company and i be send to a state call gujarat
we go there and there be nothing
i say to my bos can you even tell_me where ' the office
which way do you_want me to go
he say there_' no office address
that '_why we hire you to build our business
and for the next couple of year i recruit a huge number of people and we create the second large business of that company
so i tell people that when you choose your first job choose one where you_can really make a difference from day 1 rather_than get submerge in a big company mind set
it also teach me that if_you be go to be successful you have get to treat your company like your very own
because as an entrepreneur you be depend_on yourself to create the value not anyone_else
you_can not rely_on other people to tell you what to do
you have get to take the initiative yourself
and if_you do that you_know you be go to have a great chance of success
q. important lesson you have learn from mentor over the year
a. my previous bos be a very successful c.e.o. he run the company for over a decade and we achieve fantastic result
he teach me many thing but he be immensely focused
time be the only one clear constraint in life and if_you focus_on a few thing you have a great chance of achieve something interesting
he teach people like me and others who have this burn desire to achieve more and more to prioritize and to be very consistent_with the priority
he never change the strategy in 12 year
he focus_on a few big thing and go after them
q.
you say you come from a family of entrepreneur but now you_'re run a big company
how do you try_to foster an entrepreneurial culture
a. you have to take risk
entrepreneurship also mean that we_need more idea than we have money for
i keep tell people you think we be work for a big company but i be go to starve you of resource
only then will i have the best idea
scarcity give rise to more idea than abundance do
scarcity be the mother of invention
i have grow_up like that
scale be also the enemy of speed
as you become big you_'re go to get slow and slow
so you have to create small team because_they be more effective and more efficient than big team
you also have to be careful about how_many layer you_'re create
q.
how do you hire
what quality be you look for
a. one be how bright they be
you have get to have a level of intellectual agility
the second thing i look for be hunger for success
be the person hungry or have they have enough
if there_' hunger for success the person will by and large outperform those_who do_n't
q.
and your career advice
a.
in my whole life i have never worry_about my next job
i never do
i never think since i be do so well what will come next
i always think the job i be do be the very best job of my_life
so i tell people do_not worry_about what somebody else be do and when they be get promote and how_much money they_'re make
we look around a bit too_much
none of that be go to help you do a better job
so do the very best you_can of the job that be give to you
it_' like swallow the bitter pill
