# prob-stat-rev

Atx cohort 1 probability and statistics review with some new Bayes material added in (because it's super awesome).

Students should review the slides provided by Sean (Tammy).

This will be primarily a conceptual conversation/quiz over page 1.
And then we will talk Bayes on page 2.
Page 3 just has a couple loose ends
