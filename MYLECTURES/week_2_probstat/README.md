# prob-stat-rev

Atx cohort 1 probability and statistics review with some new Bayes material added in (because it's super awesome).

Students should review the slides provided by Sean (Tammy) and be ready to be grilled about anything and everything there.
That will be done by going over everything in the pdf and chasing rabbits down holes as needed. 

This will be done primarily as a conceptual conversation/quiz over page 1.
And then we will talk Bayes on page 2.
Page 3 just has a couple loose ends that were floating around at the wrong time and ended up as Appendi. Appendices.
