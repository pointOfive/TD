Getting started
======================================

Where are we going?
----------------------

We mentioned machine learning---here's a figure that provides a little more perspective.
Note the emphasis on sample size "rules of thumb".  This is a characteristic of the 
empirical and computational nature of machine learning that enables the use of 
complex and sensitive models which subsequently require large amounts of data to actualize
meaningful as opposed to spurious model fits.  The figure also gives an indication of 
the vast and diverse set of tools and tasks that make up the machine learning world.
Now, if you're interested in exploring this fascinating space of methodologies and learning 
how to leverage and apply these methodologies (which you probably are, since you're here), then
you're going to need a fundamental understanding and serviceable skill set in programming and 
probability and statistics. And if you're just starting your journey -- congratulations! -- 
you've come to the right place!

Industry Leading Tools
----------------------

The above figure is part of `Scikit-Learn's <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_
extensive documentation and tutorial collection. Scikit-Learn is the leading open source
collection of machine learning tools. There are some competitors (notably R, which has
seen an increase in machine learning capabilities, but is still tailored more towards 
the more traditional statistics and data analysis communities), but it is safe to say that 
Scikit-Learn is the industry standard bearer. Scikit-Learn is a library in the python
programming language, another industry standard that has seen widespread adoption and
established an incredibly vast and diverse ecosystem. Python is, and has been for quite some 
time now, the hottest most generally useful program language on the market. If you're 
looking to build up your programming skill set, you cannot go wrong Python.  
One final industry leader is the Anaconda framework from Continuum Analytics. 
Anaconda is a platform that simplifies package management and deployment of open source 
data science capabilities.  


Installing Python
-------------------

If (a) you want to follow along with the examples and (b) since Python is
the working language of the Data Science Immersive, we encourage you to 
install Python.

Installing an Editor
-----------------------

There are many editors to choose from... 
Unless you have a programming editor that you are already comfortable with try using Atom.
