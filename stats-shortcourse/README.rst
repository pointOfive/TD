Statistics short-course
==========================

Course website: `<https://galvanizeopensource.github.io/stats-shortcourse/>`_

As part of the admissions process for the `Galvanize immersive program
in data science <http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science/>`_
there are two interviews: Python and statistics.  These materials
survey the areas of probability and statistics that will be covered in
the statistics interview.  In addition to the overview there are
resources for further study that are meant to reinforce the most
important topics.

The main topics to be covered will be as follows:

   **Day 1**: Probability, Probability distributions, Bayesian and frequentist paradigms

   **Day 2**: Random variables, Statistical inference, Regression, Classification, Evaluation metrics  

We well begin in the first day with a gentle introduction to
probability and the major distributions used in statistics. We will
finish with a concept-driven explanation of frequentist and Bayesian
statistics.

On the second day we will dive a bit further into how to make use of
probability distributions for inference and hypothesis testing.  We
will then introduce regression and classification through the use of
examples.  Finally, we will discuss some of the commonly use methods
of evaluating model results.

We will use Python to illustrate the concepts, but no working
knowledge of Python or any other language is required.
