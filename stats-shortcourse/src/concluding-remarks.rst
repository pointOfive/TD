Where do we want to be with machine learning algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------

**Algorithms are not just black boxes**

  * Know when is it appropriate to use the algorithms/tools
  * Provide enough resources so that:
     * You explain what the algorithm is doing in plain English
     * You implement a simple version from the ground up
	    
.. note:: The last point may be more difficult for some algorithms, but we provide you with the necessary resources to follow up on such topics should you wish to.
	      
Data Science Careers and Galvanize Placement Rates
--------------------------------------------------


Students who have attended Galvanize have been `very successful <https://www.galvanize.com/citations>`_ 
in changing their career track and finding awesome jobs in the data science industry.  And we'd love to take
credit for it.  But the truth is it's more about you -- your aptitude, determination and drive -- 
than it is about us.  We absolutely have amazingly passionate, caring, dedicated and expert instructors committed to making
your learning experience as productive and enjoyable as possible. No question about it: our instructional staff is world-class
and you will not feel otherwise.  And we work out of an amazing co-working space that deeply embeds us into the  
tech industry -- we're connected to everyone from the biggest established players, 
the midsize startups solidifying their market space, all the way down to incredibly driven 
entrepreneurs who are passionate about creating the next big thing.  

But there's no job just "lined up and waiting for you" when you finish. You have to make it happen and go get it -- 
although we'll be there to help you every step of the way as you make your transition: Galvanize is deeply committed to the  
the career services component of our immersive.   
The data science career is so rewarding on so many levels (e.g., Growth/Recognition, Creativity/Independence, Community/Status -- 
i.e. the three factors identified in the psychology literature as contributing to job satisfaction) 
which makes it an extremely competitive job market.
So your effort and learning won't stop with Galvanize.  You're gonna have to hussle and grind 
and seek out opportunities for career growth and "always be getting better".  And if that's who you are,
then Galvanize is a program for you. 

At the end of every cohort, there's always several students who attend a public data science lecture and then come back
and say, "Yeah, I totally get what they're talking about -- I'm not hearing anything I don't understand anymore -- I
know what's going on now". 
And that's basically what the Galvanize DSI program is: a jump start to get you familiarized with everything that's
going on in the data science community and equip you with the skill set you need to be able to keep developing your expertise 
as you grow and develop your career trajectory.  




Resources for further study
-----------------------------

If you want to get through the interview process and enroll in the Data Science Immersive,
you're on your way, but not there just yet. The "Statistics/Machine Learning" interview evaluates 
your mastery of the content covered here. But it also begins to assess your familiarity 
and comfort with modern predictive methodologies.  To ace the "Statistics/Machine Learning" interview
you need to have a very strong handle on the following material:

  * `Galvanize self study resources <https://github.com/zipfian/self-study-resources>`_
  * Chapters 1-4 of `Introduction to Statistical Learning <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf>`_
  * Chapters 1-4 of `15 hours of machine learning videos <http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos>`_


If you need to start a little slower as you begin learning these topics, you may want to have a look here:

  * `Khan Academy - statistics and probability <https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability>`_
  * `Hypothesis testing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6AdoiNUyWI&list=PL5-da3qGB5IBSSCPANhTgrw82ws7w_or9>`_
  * `Useful flashcards <http://www.cram.com/flashcards/probability-for-data-science-8215075>`_

Happy Travels!!
